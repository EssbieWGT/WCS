Many American businesses are bracing for higher costs after President Donald Trump levied wide-ranging tariffs this spring, a move that economists have largely panned. But for workers in southeastern Michigan, the heart of the U.S. automotive industry, the story is a little more complicated. Here, manufacturing is “our lifeblood,” according to Sean Crawford, a skilled trades apprentice at General Motors’ Warren Tech Center in suburban Detroit.
A Trump critic, Crawford is mostly skeptical that tariffs will lead to more or better jobs. But Crawford’s co-workers have generally welcomed tariffs on foreign auto manufacturers, he said. As a third-generation autoworker, he understands the appeal. “They’re just happy something is being done,” he said.
Crawford grew up in Flint, Michigan, where he witnessed the loss of thousands of GM jobs decimate the town’s economy. For generations, manufacturing jobs helped people in the region build stable lives — purchase homes, raise families and end their careers with secure retirement.
Trump tapped into that manufacturing mythos when he vowed to make the country “a manufacturing nation once again” in his inauguration speech. He had repeated this message often on the campaign trail, promising to “create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.”
Yet rather than the promised manufacturing revival, the first eight months of Trump’s second term have brought uncertainty and upheaval. Widespread tariffs stalled hiring and rollbacks of clean energy policies have stymied investment and disrupted the fragile momentum that had been building under President Joe Biden, whose legislative agenda had spurred investment in manufacturing.
The fledgling growth of domestic manufacturing that had created more than 610,000 manufacturing jobs during the Biden administration and laid the groundwork for many more has “basically collapsed,” said Todd Tucker, director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute, a Washington-based, left-leaning think tank.
In fact, Trump was so dissatisfied with the weak July jobs report — which showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector had lost 37,000 jobs over three straight months — that he fired the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in early August, alleging on his social media platform Truth Social that the less-than-stellar job numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Since the president first announced his sweeping tariffs, the country’s trade policy has been marked by chaos and volatility. The tariffs have been wielded for sharply different purposes, with some intended to protect domestic markets and others aimed at punishing foreign countries for actions Trump doesn’t like. That shifting rationale has deepened the sense of uncertainty, as have the constantly changing tariff rates. In addition, countries around the world have responded to the new trade regime with their own retaliatory tariffs.
“It’s almost impossible to keep up with the new deals, the new tariffs, the tariff cuts and the tariff hikes,” said Tucker. The instability is “the opposite of what companies need to be able to make long-term investments.”
That uncertainty has had a chilling effect on manufacturing. Many companies are pulling back from hiring simply because, amid the impulsive and erratic policymaking of the Trump administration, they don’t know what will happen next.
According to a second-quarter survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, just 55.4% of manufacturers are optimistic about the future of their companies — a 15-percentage-point drop since the first quarter and the lowest rating since the early days of the pandemic. Indeed, 89% of manufacturers surveyed said that operational costs have increased due to tariffs. While economists have criticized the broad reach of Trump’s tariffs, Tucker said that “select, strategic and targeted tariffs” could help some American industries.
Crawford’s union, the United Auto Workers, hopes that the 25% tariff on most foreign automakers will lead to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing and more stable jobs for autoworkers. (Japan, whose automakers hold a significant share of the U.S. market, recently negotiated its tariff rate down to 15% in a deal with the Trump administration.)
“[W]e do not support reckless chaotic tariffs on all countries,” UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in an April op-ed for Jacobin. But auto tariffs, he wrote, are “a first step in ending the free-trade disaster,” adding that “the automakers, the auto market, and corporate America can afford it.”
Crawford is not so sure tariffs are a winning strategy, even tariffs on foreign car makers.  “With the tariffs swinging as wildly as they are … I feel like a lot of [car] companies aren’t on firm footing,” he said. He said it’s possible that his job and workplace could benefit, adding that even one additional shift at a plant could create jobs that would be a boon to the local economy. But he doubts that tariffs will inspire companies to break ground on new facilities. Instead, he reasons that if companies pass off tariff costs onto consumers, demand will decline, and layoffs could follow.
Crawford’s concerns about layoffs have already been borne out. GM’s profit fell by more than $1 billion in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2024, a decline executives attributed in part to tariffs. The company temporarily laid off 200 workers at a factory in Detroit suburb Hamtramck in April (though GM representatives blamed “market dynamics,” not tariffs.) That same month, Stellantis laid off 900 workers following dismal quarterly earnings, and Volvo cut more than 1,000 workers at its Mack Truck plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.
At the same time, tariff pressures led GM to announce in April that the company would increase production at a plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and hire 225-250 temporary workers. But temporary workers earn lower pay than other hourly workers and also receive fewer benefits. Temporary status may not even be temporary; Crawford said he’s known temporary workers that have held “temporary” positions for as many as seven years. And that’s not including the workers hired by third-party agencies to do auto production work for companies like GM.
“Yeah, American manufacturing, rah rah rah,” Crawford said sarcastically. “But are those actually going to be good jobs? Are they going to be unionized jobs? Are they going to be family and community supporting jobs?”
If not, he thinks the rhetoric is just “emotionally exploiting” workers who want the secure and stable work manufacturing once promised.
While it remains to be seen how exactly auto manufacturing will be impacted by tariffs, clean energy manufacturing — which was growing rapidly under the Biden administration — has been hard hit by Trump’s industrial policy. Since the start of 2025, more than $18 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects have been cancelled, according to data from environmental business coalition E2. Those cancellations translate into thousands of jobs that will never materialize.
“We were on the cusp of an economic revolution the likes we haven’t seen in generations,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “Unfortunately, that is now at risk,” he said.
As just one example, more than 1,000 jobs were intended for union sheet metalworkers at a Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. site near Dayton, Ohio, that was set to transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen. Instead, the facility will continue to produce “beautiful coal,” with a goal to “operate fully under AI,” CEO Lourenco Goncalves said in a July earnings call. According to Steel Industry News, the AI operation is meant to increase efficiency for the company by 15%-20%.
“Automation is the name of the game” in many facilities, Babak Hafezi, adjunct professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business and CEO of international consulting firm Hafezi Capital, said in an email. He predicts companies will choose between two strategies if Trump’s trade policy stands: Use exclusively domestic materials alongside automation — in which cases workers are unlikely to benefit — or move production to the cheapest country possible. Either way, workers — and communities that rely on manufacturing — will lose, according to Hafezi.
Crawford believes a stronger labor movement is ultimately what will lead to a resurgence of American manufacturing jobs. It’s hard for workers to bargain for jobs when unions “don’t really have the same dominance in the auto sector like we used to,” he said. He is unsurprised that some manufacturing workers have welcomed tariffs, even if they may mean higher prices and fewer opportunities for other workers.
“People want jobs,” Crawford said. “That’s understandable.”

The Trump administration has ordered construction stopped on Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project, even though it is 80% complete. (Photo courtesy of Ørsted)Limited power supply in extreme weather events, rising and unpredictable utility bills and thousands of union laborers without work.
That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.
Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.
“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”
The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.
“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”










The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States.


– Attorneys generals in an Aug. 28 filing as part of a multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration


The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.
Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
Stuck in limbo
Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.
“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”
Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.
Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.
“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

– Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121 on the millwrights stranded at sea


More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.
The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.
Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”
The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.
Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line. For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders. We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”
DOT yanks port funding
The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Friday it was pulling $679 million in federal infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country. Among the casualties: an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.
“The Quonset Development Corporation is disappointed by this decision but understands that this administration is working to fund projects in line with its current policy priorities,” Steven King, managing director for the quasi-public state agency, said in an emailed response Friday. “Given that the Quonset Business Park’s 250 companies work broadly across nearly every sector of the economy, including in shipbuilding, we believe there is common ground to pursue and look forward to working together on new grant projects that align with the administration’s objectives and that grow the economy.”
Gov. Dan McKee was not as forgiving.
“This decision undermines progress on critical infrastructure and threatens Rhode Island’s economic and energy future,” McKee said in a statement late Friday afternoon. “The Port of Davisville and the broader Quonset Business Park are vital hubs for manufacturing, shipping, and energy, including the state’s offshore wind industry. This funding would have modernized port infrastructure and expanded cargo capacity. By withdrawing it, the Trump administration is undermining a high-performing port that drives real economic output, strengthens regional supply chains, and plays a central role in advancing energy and long-term growth for Rhode Island and across the Northeast.”
The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”
Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.
Judge Young is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing. A ruling will come at a later, unscheduled date.

“If you think that it’s somehow racist to use the word ‘alien,’ then I presume you got your education by sitting in movie theaters and watching movies about extraterrestrials,” Patton said. “Meanwhile, some of us get our education by sitting in courtrooms and by reading federal statutes.”
Although he later told Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith that “I sort of get it,” when talking about the term’s implications, I personally find such a strong reaction to word choice baffling. Language changes and evolves, and has since the beginning of time. The words we once used freely may go into the “forbidden” box. That doesn’t mean anyone has done anything good or bad, necessarily; it just means that tastes have changed.
Progressives worry about such overreactions these days. Perhaps it’s because of President Trump’s linguistic overflow, a constant stream of crude invective. Should they be talking like him? Perhaps it’s because of genuine concern about reaching a broader audience.
Nonetheless, moderate Democratic think tank Third Way just released a list of words that its says politicians should avoid using when talking to the general public.
You can read them all in the accompanying box below.
“We are putting a spotlight on the language we use that puts a wall between us and everyday people of all races, religions, and ethnicities,” the group writes. “These are words that people simply do not say, yet they hear them from Democrats.”
The list doesn’t appear to draw from any polling or research. As a longtime journalist, I’m reminded of “banned words” compilations that grizzled copy editors would pass around in decades past, harping on supposedly ungrammatical or illogical terms.
I don’t love many of the words, and Third Way may have a point. So did the grizzled copy editors! That being said, I’m not sure that studiously avoiding such terms will hand the magical keys to power to progressives. After all, Trump has conspicuously said whatever the heck he wanted. Do political consultants think that lawmakers policing their vocabulary more will improve the situation?
No, the real problem with these politically correct terms is that regular folks just don’t know what they mean. That leaves them open to misinterpretation and outright distortion by political opponents. (Remember “critical race theory”?)
If language has any point besides sounding pretty, it needs to communicate efficiently and clearly. That’s one of the reasons why journalists traditionally avoid language like “passed away” or “went on to his heavenly reward” in favor of the blunt: “he died.”
So yes, do that. But will using a random word from Third Way’s list – or trying to make people think about what they’re saying in the first place – doom democracy?
If so, we have far bigger problems than vocabulary.
Speaking of problems, Kansas legislators just banned some of the simplest words – pronouns – from state employees’ email signatures. That’s right, “he/him,” “she/her,” “they/them” and the like. The last time I checked, such language serves as basic building blocks of English sentences. Perhaps if lawmakers wrote more often, they would understand that.
But conservatives have decided that using such words in a signature block signifies an unacceptable embrace of “gender ideology.” Talk about ridiculous terms.
Including pronouns in an email signature block demonstrates sensitivity and support for transgender people. For today’s senselessly cruel rightwing ideologues, that counts as an unpardonable sin.
So the Kansas Legislature just banned the practice altogether.
The difference, then, between the left and right when it comes to disputed language? Liberals are trying to police themselves to appeal to a greater number of people. Conservatives are literally obliterating disfavored groups’ identities.
I’m not sure that using preferred language always makes a difference. But I know that listening does. And I know that allowing people to use the language they choose, to speak about what they want, can change the world.
What’s in a word? These days, a hell of a lot.

Small local organizations called Active Clubs have spread widely across the U.S. and internationally, using fitness as a cover for a much more alarming mission. These groups are a new and harder-to-detect form of white supremacist organizing that merges extremist ideology with fitness and combat sports culture.
Active Clubs frame themselves as innocuous workout groups on digital platforms and decentralized networks to recruit, radicalize and prepare members for racist violence. The clubs commonly use encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, Wire and Matrix to coordinate internally.
For broader propaganda and outreach they rely on alternative social media platforms such as Gab, Odysee, VK and sometimes BitChute. They also selectively use mainstream sites such as Instagram, Facebook, X and TikTok, until those sites ban the clubs.
Active Club members have been implicated in orchestrating and distributing neo-Nazi recruitment videos and manifestos. In late 2023, for instance, two Ontario men, Kristoffer Nippak and Matthew Althorpe, were arrested and charged with distributing materials for the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division and the transnational terrorist group Terrorgram.
Following their arrests, Active Club Canada’s public network went dark, Telegram pages were deleted or rebranded, and the club went virtually silent. Nippak was granted bail under strict conditions, while Althorpe remains in custody.
As a sociologist studying extremism and white supremacy since 1993, I have watched the movement shift from formal organizations to small, decentralized cells – a change embodied most clearly by Active Clubs.
 White nationalism 3.0

According to private analysts who track far-right extremist activities, the Active Club network has a core membership of 400 to 1,200 white men globally, plus sympathizers, online supporters and passive members. The clubs mainly target young white men in their late teens and twenties.
Since 2020, Active Clubs have expanded rapidly across the United States, Canada and Europe, including the U.K., France, Sweden and Finland. Precise numbers are hard to verify, but the clubs appear to be spreading, according to The Counter Extremism Project, the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and my own research.
The clubs reportedly operate in at least 25 U.S. states, and potentially as many as 34. Active U.S. chapters reportedly increased from 49 in 2023 to 78 in 2025.
The clubs’ rise reflects a broader shift in white supremacist strategy, away from formal organizations and social movements. In 2020, American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo introduced the concept of “White Nationalism 3.0” – a decentralized, branded and fitness-based approach to extremist organizing.
Rundo previously founded the Rise Above Movement, which was a violent, far-right extremist group in the U.S. known for promoting white nationalist ideology, organizing street fights and coordinating through social media. The organization carried out attacks at protests and rallies from 2016 through 2018.
Active Clubs embed their ideology within apolitical activities such as martial arts and weightlifting. This model allows them to blend in with mainstream fitness communities. However, their deeper purpose is to prepare members for racial conflict.
 ‘You need to learn how to fight’

Active Club messaging glorifies discipline, masculinity and strength – a “warrior identity” designed to attract young men.
“The active club is not so much a structural organization as it is a lifestyle for those willing to work, risk and sweat to embody our ideals for themselves and to promote them to others,” Rundo explained via his Telegram channel.
“They never were like, ‘You need to learn how to fight so you can beat up people of color.’ It was like, ‘You need to learn how to fight because people want to kill you in the future,’” a former Active Club member told Vice News in 2023.
These cells are deliberately small – often under a dozen members – and self-contained, which gives them greater operational security and flexibility. Each club operates semi-autonomously while remaining connected to the broader ideology and digital network.
 Expanding globally and deepening ties

Active Clubs maintain strategic and ideological connections with formal white supremacist groups, including Patriot Front, a white nationalist and neofascist group founded in 2017 by Thomas Rousseau after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Active Clubs share extremist beliefs with these organizations, including racial hierarchy and the “Great Replacement” theory, which claims white populations are being deliberately replaced by nonwhite immigrants. While publicly presenting as fitness groups, they may collaborate with white supremacist groups on recruitment, training, propaganda or public events.
Figures connected to accelerationist groups – organizations that seek to create social chaos and societal collapse that they believe will lead to a race war and the destruction of liberal democracy – played a role in founding the Active Club network. Along with the Rise Above Movement, they include Atomwaffen Division and another neo-Nazi group, The Base – organizations that repackage violent fascism to appeal to disaffected young white men in the U.S.
 Brotherhood as a cover

By downplaying explicit hate symbols and emphasizing strength and preparedness, Active Clubs appeal to a new generation of recruits who may not initially identify with overt racism but are drawn to a culture of hypermasculinity and self-improvement.
Anyone can start a local Active Club chapter with minimal oversight. This autonomy makes it hard for law enforcement agencies to monitor the groups and helps the network grow rapidly.
Shared branding and digital propaganda maintain ideological consistency. Through this approach, Active Clubs have built a transnational network of echo chambers, recruitment pipelines and paramilitary-style training in parks and gyms.
Club members engage in activities such as combat sports training, propaganda dissemination and ideological conditioning. Fight sessions are often recorded and shared online as recruitment tools.
Members distribute flyers, stickers and online content to spread white supremacist messages. Active Clubs embed themselves in local communities by hosting events, promoting physical fitness, staging public actions and sharing propaganda.
Potential members first see propaganda on encrypted apps such as Telegram or on social media. The clubs recruit in person at gyms, protests and local events, vetting new members to ensure they share the group’s beliefs and can be trusted to maintain secrecy.
 From fringe to functioning network

Based on current information from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, there are 187 active chapters within the Active Club Network across 27 countries – a 25% increase from late 2023. The Crowd Counting Consortium documented 27 protest events involving Active Clubs in 2022-2023.
However, precise membership numbers remain difficult to ascertain. Some groups call themselves “youth clubs” but share similar ideas and aesthetics and engage in similar activities.
Active Club members view themselves as defenders of Western civilization and masculine virtue. From their perspective, their activities represent noble resistance rather than hate. Members are encouraged to stay secretive, prepare for societal collapse and build a network of committed, fit men ready to act through infiltration, activism or violence.
 Hiding in plain sight

Law enforcement agencies, researchers and civil society now face a new kind of domestic threat that wears workout clothes instead of uniforms.
Active Clubs work across international borders, bound by shared ideas and tactics and a common purpose. This is the new white nationalism: decentralized, modernized, more agile and disguised as self-improvement. What appears to be a harmless workout group may be a gateway to violent extremism, one pushup at a time.

Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

New regulations banning them go into effect today.,Andrea Joy Campbell,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/junk-fees-unfairly-rob-consumers-new-regulations-banning-them-go-into-effect-today/,"
Americans spend tens of billions of dollars on hidden or surprise “junk fees” that deceptively raise costs beyond advertised prices.
The post ‘Junk fees’ unfairly rob consumers. New regulations banning them go into effect today.   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT’S MOVE-IN season in Massachusetts, and you may have just seen an ad for a studio apartment for $2,500 per month. That amount is going to stretch your budget, but recognizing how competitive the housing market is, you know you need to jump on that rental quickly.  
So, you head to the management office the very next day to sign your lease. Just before signing, you notice the amount you’d have to pay every month will actually be $2,750 – beyond what you have budgeted for rent. The extra $250 comes from a mandatory “trash pick-up” fee combined with a vague “amenities” fee. You don’t want to start the daunting apartment search process over again, so you sign the lease. But the entire process leaves you feeling misled and paying more than you originally anticipated. 
We hear these stories often. If it’s not apartment fees tacked on at the last minute, it’s “resort fees” at a hotel, “convenience fees” when you purchase a ticket, or “processing fees” when checking out online.  
These fees are not simply an inconvenience – they’re a widespread, costly problem impacting all of us. Every year, Americans spend tens of billions of dollars on hidden or surprise “junk fees” that deceptively raise costs beyond advertised prices. As consumers face rising costs of living, these pesky fees quietly drain consumers’ wallets.  
This is why, as attorney general, I’ve used my authority to enact nation-leading, economy-wide consumer protection regulations making it clear that “junk fees” are prohibited under Massachusetts law.  
Effective today – these regulations are for every person who’s had their budgeting blown apart by last-minute “surprises,” for every parent who’s had to explain to their child why the gift they promised is now out of their price range, and so many more. 
Amidst an ongoing affordability crisis, these new rules will require businesses to disclose the full price of their goods and services upfront. No more misleading price advertising. No more burying fees at the end of a transaction.  
These regulations go beyond just requiring upfront pricing for one-off purchases. They’ll also help consumers more easily cancel or avoid unwanted costs related to trial offers, automatic renewals, and subscriptions – like gym memberships and meal delivery services. They’ll make it so that a 7-day free trial for an online streaming service won’t quietly turn into $150 in monthly charges without notice. They’ll ensure that you’re able to cancel that unwanted subscription the same way you signed up for it – online, not by mail. 
The regulations will also help level the playing field for businesses by allowing potential customers to more accurately compare prices while shopping. That way, the next time you go shopping in Massachusetts, you’ll know exactly how much something costs, excluding taxes and shipping charges, before you decide to check-out. And no business will be allowed to hide those fees until the last moment before purchase. 
Massachusetts has long been on the forefront of consumer protection, having some of the strongest laws in the country. And my office’s “junk fee” regulations are just one way we’ve built upon that legacy. Unlike many other state or federal counterparts, our “junk fee” regulations will apply broadly across industries and businesses operating in Massachusetts – making them stronger, bolder, and truly nation-leading.  
As the current federal administration steps back from consumer protection – as evidenced by its efforts to dismantle one of the nation’s chief financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – we have and will continue to step up.  
If you believe you’ve experienced an unfair or deceptive “junk fee,” you may file a consumer complaint with my office online at mass.gov/ago. And more information regarding our “junk fee” regulations, including guidance to help businesses comply with the new rules, is available online at mass.gov/ago/junkfees. 
Today, we turn the page on “junk fees” and deceptive costs. Today, the price you see is the price you pay.

(Taylor Sisk for KFF Health News)Rebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan’s capital city that she never would have expected.
“It’s a very weird time in our lives,” said Kasen, executive director of the Women’s Center of Greater Lansing.
Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women’s Center staff reported being harassed.
A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by “First Amendment auditors” outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.
In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.
Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward “an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions.”
Researchers at American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, “hate is intersectional.” (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL’s director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of “A Minecraft Movie” prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.
The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.
The team defines extremism as the belief that one’s group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity, or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.
Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they’re on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)
Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s deputy director for prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that’s rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?
They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip “all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism” and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.
“We’re not about, ‘How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?’” Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL’s deputy director for regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. “Rather, ‘How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?’”
Tim McVeigh
Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.
The state’s capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.
Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer’s covid lockdown directives.
Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about “how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible.”
The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and “Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry.”
Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.
The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.
Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She’s a proponent of the public health approach. It’s “providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward,” she said. It’s a way to channel energy “and feel like you can actually create change with community.”
Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.
In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” at an American Legion post.
In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book “They She He Me: Free to Be!” Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.
“It’s really important that rural communities not be left behind,” Flanagan said. “They persistently are in America, and then they’re often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges.”
National plans
The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children’s Hospital’s Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City’s Citizens Crime Commission.
And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.
Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism’s having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. “It’s just devastating,” he said. “It’s really startling.”
Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, “I would say now it has been completely shattered.” Violent extremists now feel “unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back.”
“We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime,” Simi said.
The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people’s lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.
“If you have a germ out there,” Whitaker said, “and people aren’t aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it’s an actual problem, you won’t enact basic protective behavior.”

The Boston Globe reported recently that a small group of neo-Nazis gathered outside the New Hampshire State House in Concord. Wearing facemasks, they held a banner proclaiming “Trump loves Epstein.” Were they saying this was a good thing? Or were they protesting? What about Nazis’ historical hatred of Jews? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
A posted scholarly lecture on the Virginia Museum of History and Culture’s website tells us that early KKK members wore burlap feed sacks over the faces, donned animal horns and wore white muslin masks to indicate they were “non-human,” including corpses come back to life. Who were these members of the nation’s first domestic terrorism group? The neighbors of the people they hunted? How did they feel about what they were doing? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.

Christine Palm
Today, all across the country, masked men, claiming to be representatives of the U.S. government, are snatching people off the streets, out of courtrooms, off high school ballfields, and from the lines of workers in car washes. Are they employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement? Are they self-appointed vigilantes? Are they sex traffickers acting under cover to kidnap people for sex slavery? Who knows? It is impossible to read their expressions, because they all wear masks.
Hiding one’s face is, of course, an ancient practice. Humans have always worn masks — in war and sports, in religious ritual, during celebrations, and on stage. Shakespeare’s lovers donned them at masquerade balls. Bad guys like Darth Vader and Jason Voorhees wear masks. But so do good guys like Batman, Spiderman and Zorro. Complex anti-heroes like the Phantom of the Opera maintain their mystery behind a mask. And of course children love the strange, freeing anonymity a mask gives them at Hallowe’en.
Most of us — those who respect science and were concerned for others’ safety — wore masks for three long years during the Covid pandemic. And we were thrilled to toss them once the vaccine allowed life to return to normal. Some folks with compromised immune systems choose to wear them still, especially in crowds.
But now? For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. Our hands instinctively fly up to our cheeks and cover our nose and mouth when we are caught doing something wrong, or embarrassing.
So a simple question for ICE agents (both real and impostors), for neo-Nazis, and for today’s white supremacists posting hateful literature on lampposts in small towns across the nation, is this: if you’re too ashamed to show your face, why are you doing what you’re doing?
People in public office (as I once was) are often stalked, harassed and ridiculed on social media. Sometimes, as in the tragic case of the state representative in Minnesota, they are murdered. The public expects elected officials to show their faces, literally and figuratively. It’s called accountability. And yes, often it puts a target on our back, as it has recently with Rep. Corey Paris, who is being sent the most racist, vile and dangerous threats from across the country for calling out ICE in his district. Still, I don’t know any elected person hiding behind a mask, unless you considerTrump’s orange make-up a bizarre version of kumadori, the stylized makeup worn in Japanese Kabuki theater.
In 2016, at a protest march I attended after Trump was first elected, I engaged a young man who seemed to be in his mid-20s. He wore a Trump tee-shirt and was heckling us from the sidelines. I asked why he was covering his face with a mask. He said something that cannot be reprinted here — something inspired by Trump’s boasting about what he does to women’s bodies. He spat out he would do that to me if I didn’t move on.
So I asked him what his mother would think of that. Yes, I admit, a prissy, perhaps uptight thing to do, but still. I wanted him to explain his thought process. After all, aren’t we liberals supposed to engage with these folks? To get to know their minds? Not to judge but, rather, to “meet them where they are?”
So instead of returning this threat with something similar about his private parts (which, as everyone knows, are a lot more fragile than a woman’s), I asked again: Does your mother know you’re doing this? He emitted a sort of grunt. I could not read his expression, because he wore a mask. But he did drop his shoulders a little, and bowed his head just a bit. The parade of marchers moved on.
I think of that young man often — he’s probably around 30 now. Plenty old enough to be a father to a child who may get measles. Perhaps his mother now has cancer and needs to enter a clinical trial that’s been defunded. Perhaps the tariffs have cost him his job. I wonder if the mask will fall from his face when the scales fall from his eyes.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke to more than 6,500 people in Portland on Labor Day, endorsing union-backed candidates for the U.S. Senate and governor who made pitches to create a government that serves workers and everyday people, not billionaires. 
Graham Platner, the oysterman challenging long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, and Troy Jackson, former president of the Maine Senate and fifth-generation logger from Allagash, joined Sanders at the “Fighting Oligarchy” rally to appeal to widespread concerns about affordability.
While repeating common critiques made by other Democrats against President Donald Trump’s administration for providing tax cuts for the wealthy while stripping funding for health care, education and other programs essential to the working class, the trio also stood up for causes moderates have avoided, such as championing tribal rights and calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis driven by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. 
“This is an unprecedented, and in fact, dangerous moment in American history,” Sanders told the crowd, with local union workers seated behind him on stage. “We have got to respond in an unprecedented way, and the way we respond is to build a kind of strong, progressive, grassroots movement, the likes of which this country has never seen.”

An anti-establishment pitch 
Portland resident Ken Bailey, a 76-year-old former member of the U.S. Air Force who joined the anti-war movement in the 1970s, sees that as more possible now than ever in his life.
Bailey considers himself a democratic socialist, like Sanders, who Bailey has been a fan of since he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont in 1981. 
“That win knocked me off my feet,” Bailey said. But, then, he hadn’t imagined the more widespread embrace of democratic socialist ideas he’s now seeing — pointing out the range of attendees: others like himself adorning grey beards, parents with their children on their hips, college students. 
He also sees momentum beyond Maine, notably Zohran Mamdani’s primary win for New York mayor. Platner’s campaign has ties to Mamdani’s, as the two share progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats.
While Graham and Jackson are Democrats, they used their speeches to separate their candidacies from the establishment. 
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” Jackson said. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Platner sees the path forward in the legacies of the labor movement and the Civil Rights Movement: “legacies of building power,” as he put it.
“Let’s be clear: we do not live in a system that is broken,” Platner said. “We live in a system that is functioning exactly as it is intended.” 
The United States is already living in an oligarchy, Sanders said, because the top 1% of earners control the economy and politicians. 
“It is not just Republicans,” he said. “It is also the fact that billionaires play a much too significant role in the Democratic Party as well.”
Sanders specifically took aim at the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2010 that allowed corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Mainers have backed campaign finance reforms several times, including in the past two general elections, but the laws have been stalled in the courts. 
But Sanders said he, and he believes attendees, have a vision for a government “of the people,” he said, and the crowd responded, “for the people.”

Maine’s ‘affordability crisis’
The speeches also focused on the economy, specifically the struggle for Mainers to afford housing, child care and other costs that have continued to increase.
“People my age and younger are being driven out of this state by an affordability crisis,” said Platner, who is 40.
That’s the reality for Sophie Creamer, 25, who grew up in Brunswick and now attends college in Massachusetts. Creamer, who is not enrolled with any political party, said they worry about being able to move back to Maine due to the lack of available and affordable housing. Creamer is also concerned about access to health care, as someone who relies on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
While Democrats’ planks often include bringing down the cost of living, Creamer thinks progressive Democrats like those on stage in Portland Monday night are needed to push the establishment to actually change the status quo. 
Jackson said he’s running for people like Jordyn Rossignol of Caribou. Rossignol said she drained her savings to make payroll for her childcare center, Miss Jordyn’s Child Development Center, but financial reasons ultimately led to its closure and around 100 children who lost care in 2023. 
Taking the stage to express her support for the candidates, Rossignol pointed to Jackson’s work championing child care reform as the former president of the Maine Senate and called Platner “a working man, a leader and someone who won’t just say he’s concerned. He will act,” referring to the oft-repeated critique of Collins’ statements of concern.  
Gigi Larrc drove from Unity to support Jackson, handing out signs to attendees. She supports him over other candidates in the crowded governor’s race because she “does not believe in political dynasties,” she said, referring to Hannah Pingree and Angus King III, who are the children of some of Maine’s current members of Congress. Jackson’s working class background appeals to her.
“When Troy is working on getting our bread-and-butter needs met, it comes from a place of solidarity, not charity,” Larrc said.
Not all attendees knew who their gubernatorial or Senate choices will be. 
Nicole Petrin and Renee Marsh from Biddeford said they attended the event to hear Sanders speak, but they were “in the market” when it came to voting for governor. Their top priority, Petrin said, was not voting for a rich politician, or someone who is backed by rich people.
The fact that Jackson was endorsed by Sanders, however, would be “a huge deal,” in their decision, both said.

In our fast-changing world, few technological developments of recent years have had a bigger impact on young people than the emergence of instant communication and social media. And while it’s not difficult to identify the positive impacts of these phenomena, the worrisome impacts are also numerous. And this is a trend that seems certain to intensify in years to come with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.
Thankfully, many advocates have started to speak out in favor of stronger laws to protect vulnerable people – especially young people – from exploitation like predatory algorithms, social media bullying, artificial intelligence and other impacts from the online world that endanger people’s mental and even physical health. And recently NC Newsline caught up with the leader of one such group, the co-founder and executive director of the Young People’s Alliance, North Carolinian Sam Hiner.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
New Mexico’s 988 lifeline still offers LGTBQ+ option

“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. He has been waiting since 2017 for a response to a U-visa application, which protects victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators, according to letter from the law firm to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon.
Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
 Gun violence leading cause of death for U.S. children, teens

For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.

Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
 Time card discrepancies for firefighting crews lead to immigration status checks

In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
 Federal officials did not warn state agency about its investigation

The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Courtesy of SDSU Marketing and Communications)Airborne diseases have not been kind to the poultry industry in recent years.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza, which spreads through the air to the lungs of wild and captive birds, has devastated chicken and turkey flocks in waves. The price of eggs has ballooned, then fallen, as the outbreaks have flared up. Last year, the virus jumped from birds to cattle, causing trouble in the dairy industry by way of decreased milk production.
Dr. Sunil Mor of South Dakota State University thinks a lot about respiratory diseases in animals. Mor leads the virology section of the school’s Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, and has a keen interest in respiratory viruses — especially those with the potential to mutate and infect humans, known as zoonotic diseases. 
USDA rolls out $1 billion plan to combat bird flu after egg prices rise

Mor was recently named the winner of the Bayer-Snoeyenbos New Investigator Award by the American Association of Avian Pathologists, a win based on the work his lab did last year to confirm the presence of a new respiratory poultry disease in the U.S. 
Earlier this year, Mor’s team got a $150,000 grant from the Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research to develop a diagnostic tool for that disease, an emerging threat known as avian metapneumovirus. Last year, the disease cost turkey producers in Minnesota well over $100 million — a figure greater than that year’s losses from avian influenza.
Mor spoke to South Dakota Searchlight on his work, why he does it, and how SDSU’s lab can serve as a sort of airport checkpoint for disease.
EDITOR’S NOTE: This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What can you tell us about your background, and why you chose to focus on this particular area of study?
My family was raised on a farm in India, so my interest from an early age was to work with animal diseases. When I started my master’s in veterinary epidemiology and preventive medicine (in India), our department was responsible to attend to any disease outbreak in the state. I was with my supervisors, doing the investigation, the testing, and collecting more samples. 
From that point, I realized that disease investigation is the key if we want to know the exact cause of a disease. Then we can implement the prevention and control measures, and we can help the industry minimize the losses.
How did you decide to zero in on the study of respiratory viruses in poultry?
In poultry, especially with the outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, the economic losses are huge. And not only the losses due to the dead birds, but also the mental and the emotional stress and other factors. So it’s the huge impact, plus it has the genetic importance. Some of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can also infect humans, so that drew me to be more interested in the poultry viruses, with a focus on poultry respiratory viruses.
So it was realizing that if you were doing the diagnostics, you could catch the problem at the beginning and have the biggest impact?
Yes, that’s right. I like to be in a race with the viruses, or any emerging zoonotic viruses (viruses that can transmit from animals to humans), see how early I can catch them, and develop the tools to detect them as early as possible.
There’s a security checkpoint at the airport. In the diagnostic lab, we are like a TSA PreCheck security. It’s us seeing how early we can detect these kinds of deadly pathogens that may have a huge economic impact on the agricultural sector, as well as may have the potential to jump to humans. Our job is to keep an eye on any emerging threat.
What kinds of things are you most worried about coming through that checkpoint?
We’ve focused on the avian influenza virus, but now we’re doing research on this avian metapneumovirus that was detected for the first time in my lab. 
FDA chief says feds are preparing for low probability of bird flu moving to humans

Later on, USDA also confirmed our finding and declared it an emerging disease. That was a big achievement, to prove that we are a good security checkpoint for incoming or new problems for the country, not just for the state. That put us on the stage at the national level. 
We also just completed a project on SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals, zoo animals and food animals, to design tools to detect any variant in the future that may have the potential to cause a pandemic.
We also have a project right now on high-path avian influenza in cattle. As we all know, this virus jumped to cattle last year, which was big news, and also had a huge impact on the cattle industry. So we are doing surveillance to ask, ‘How widespread is this virus in the cattle?’ And then, ‘Is the virus changing over time or not?’ 
Then I’m also working on the turkey reovirus. This is considered an enteric virus, not a respiratory virus, so infections mainly go through the oral-fecal route.
How did you come to confirm the presence of a new virus in the U.S.? 
We received a phone call from North Carolina saying, ‘We have a problem going on, and we are not able to figure out the cause.’ So I received the samples, and then within three days, I confirmed that this is a new virus (for the U.S.). Within three to four months, from North Carolina, this virus had spread to almost all turkey producing states. We were receiving samples from 11 states.
How is metapneumovirus virus different from avian influenza?
Highly pathogenic avian influenza has a huge impact and kills the birds right away. If it’s positive in the flock, we just depopulate. But metapneumovirus is more like a slow poison. It reduces the immunity of the birds, so other bacteria and other viruses also start dominating. We have to manage these secondary bacterial infections, as well as the loss of the birds. We are now working on developing diagnostic tools for the rapid and specific detection of this virus, as well as vaccine development.
Do you know why North Carolina called you specifically?
When I was at the University of Minnesota and working on avian reovirus, we used to work with veterinarians all across the country. I was leading the disease investigation section. When they were not able to get any answer from other labs within three months — three months is a long time —I think they decided finally that they would reach out to me and see if I could figure out what’s going on with this new problem.
How have these emerging diseases changed the way poultry farmers do business?
Before 2023, we had very random outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Depopulation and biosecurity was enough, and there was some support from the government on the indemnity.
USDA launches national testing of milk from dairy farms to track bird flu outbreak

But now we have more, fairly regular outbreaks. That’s what happened last year. It was devastating, and it was big news with the egg prices, because so many layer farms or layer operations were infected. We’re at the point where we need to be thinking, should we just continue with these standard methods of depopulation and biosecurity measures? Or is there any need for alternative options like vaccines or some other therapeutics? Like in Europe and Asia, some countries started doing some vaccination.
I’m not sure what the future will be here to control these outbreaks, whether that’s vaccination or some novel therapeutic measures. But when it’s jumping from poultry, like to cattle last year, and then also jumping to other wild animals, zoo animals, it looks like it’s getting more localized and increasing its impact, its reach, to the different species, mammalian species, which is concerning for the human population.
Recently, there was an announcement for $100 million in funding named the High Path Poultry Innovation Grand Challenge. The focus was to look for the research applications on novel ideas to control this virus, especially to the egg layer industry, in terms of reducing the egg prices. The submission process was completed in May 2025, so we are still waiting on the decision for our proposal, but I think this funding could help us design better control measures in the future.

(Stock photo by liver Helbig via Getty Images)The new hands-free driving law in South Carolina that takes effect Monday is long overdue.
Thousands of lives have been lost while the legislation failed repeatedly.
The first state to pass a law making it illegal for drivers to hold cellphones when driving was New York in 2001. More than two-thirds of states have followed. (South Carolina became No. 33.)  And all states except Montana have a no-texting-while-driving law.
In 2023, distracted driving resulted in the deaths of 3,275 people, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which reported that “texting is the most alarming distraction.”
According to the National Safety Council, more than 12% of fatal crashes in 2023 due to distracted driving involved cellphone use. That’s a percentage largely unchanged for several years.
In September 2023, the cellphone comparison site WhistleOut graded state cellphone bans across three categories. South Carolina was among five to receive a D grade for not having a handheld ban or young driver cellphone ban.
The new law in South Carolina still allows cellphone use when the driver is stopped at a light. It has already gotten very frustrating for many of us while at lights which have turned green and one of the cars in front of us don’t move for a while — sometime to the point that the light turns red again before we get to the intersection.
With the new hands-free law, will it be any surprise if more drivers get on their phones waiting for the light to change?
Unfortunately, this law does not go nearly far enough to improve the safety on our roads.
Drivers rarely face consequences for breaking other laws. When raining during the day, most drivers have enough sense that when they turn on their windshield wipers, they also turn on their headlights. But some do not. A much larger number of drivers don’t seem to ever use or infrequently use their turn signals when turning or changing lanes.
Those rules of the road are hard to effectively enforce and would require substantially increasing law enforcement on the roads and that, clearly, is not going to happen.
There are some other things government officials can do but will require more effort and money.
For example, the Biden administration had a committee working for about three years on technology that would keep intoxicated drivers from operating a vehicle. But the committee did not meet its 2024 deadline for recommendations.
Another technology being implemented in several other countries is that of vehicle speed control. A device installed in the vehicle can slow a vehicle down if it’s traveling over the posted speed limit.
Imagine if we required that on all vehicles in the United States — if, say on Interstate 20 or Interstate 26, where the posted speed was 60 mph, a vehicle couldn’t travel more than 65 mph.
Accidents and deaths would be reduced, and we might even be able to save millions of dollars in road construction costs with all vehicles driving at a more reasonable speed.
But this approach lacks support.
So, what else, if anything, could been done in South Carolina to make our roads safer?
Vastly increasing the number of law enforcement vehicles on the road could cut down on speeding. But even if that happens, the results would be limited: Stopping a vehicle, going through the license checks, writing a citation, etc. is just so time consuming that only a very small number of vehicles could be cited in an hour.
In addition, cars tend to slow down when they see a law enforcement vehicle and speed up once they are out of sight of that vehicle.
To help resolve this problem, we could equip unmarked law enforcement vehicles with cameras and radar to catch speeders without needing to stop them. When a vehicle is going X mph over the speed limit, the cameras would record the vehicle along with the license tag and vehicle speed for maybe 10 seconds.
The enforcement vehicle’s computer would then locate the address of the vehicle’s owner and generate a citation that included the speed, time, and location of the incident.
This would allow law enforcement vehicles to send 10, 20 or more tickets every hour. Points on the driver’s license could not be assessed since there is no verification of who was driving, but after receiving a speeding ticket or two, I would hope the driver would slow down.
I can only guess how many persons might have lived or survived without severe injuries if we had addressed cellphone use 10 or 20 years ago. We now have great technology available to us if only we would consider using it.
Why are we not doing more to save lives on the road?",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/police-car-lights-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-01 12:57:10.178313
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT has more than 300 ice cream shops. This family has tried them all,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/ct-ice-cream-tour/,"After years of road trips and tastings across Connecticut, the Behuns are bringing their favorite scoops on ""tour"" throughout the state.","Craig Behun keeps a color-coded spreadsheet of every ice cream shop he’s visited. 

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
It describes each shop’s location, ice cream quality and other details, like live animals or unsavory activity in the parking lot. 
After years making the rounds, Behun and his family have selected some of their favorites to share. This summer, they transformed a food truck into a traveling creamery-on-wheels featuring a menu of ice cream flavors from all over the state.
It was no small task. In all, the Behuns visited 323 Connecticut ice cream shops.
It all started 10 years ago, when Michelle and Craig Behun’s older son, Callan, was born. “We used to go to wineries and breweries and stuff, but then we said, it’s irresponsible,” Craig said.
Searching for something to do, they set out to try Connecticut Magazine’s list of the state’s top ten ice cream spots. “Our son loved to sleep in the car, so we took advantage of road trips, and we would just put him in the car and drive,” Michelle said.
Their first stop was Rich Farm in Oxford, a family-owned business that makes ice cream on site. Now the Behuns make an annual anniversary trip there — plus dozens of other trips out for ice cream each year.
They’ve been documenting their adventures on an Instagram account called CT Ice Cream Tour since 2015. The account page is packed with delectable images of hundreds of ice cream stops in Connecticut and beyond.
From the beginning, they had their work cut out. Connecticut is home to 18,000 milking cows across 84 dairy farms, according to Bryan Hurlburt, commissioner of the Department of Agriculture.
Many daily farms deliver milk directly to consumers, or sell through a farm co-operative to a milk processor, which is how it ends up in a grocery store. The milk is also used to make yogurt, cheese, and in one case milk chocolates, Hurlburt said.
But in recent decades, small and mid-sized farms, facing rising costs for equipment and labor, have been under pressure to consolidate. The Department of Agriculture is working with some of those farms to transition from selling milk to the commodity market to developing more specialty products — like ice cream — which could be more profitable.
“What we have in Connecticut, that not every other state has, is a really interested consumer marketplace,” said Hurlburt. It’s about “different ways to take the milk and add value to it that a customer would appreciate and generate additional revenue for the farm,” said Hurlburt.
By Craig Behun’s count, Connecticut is home to about 70 homemade ice cream purveyors, which he reckons makes it the best state for ice cream stores per capita. 
One of these makers, the University of Connecticut’s Dairy Bar — where the Behuns source the vanilla ice cream served from their truck — uses milk made by the cows that graze on campus, supplemented with locally-produced cream.
Students have been taking part in ice cream production at UConn since the early 1900s, and the Dairy Bar store has been open to the public since 1953. It’s an opportunity for students to learn about ice cream production — and for locals and day-trippers to enjoy it.
The Dairy Bar serves around 250,000-300,000 customers a year. Manager Ethan Haggerty said most of those customers aren’t UConn students.
Haggerty said the secret ingredient in UConn’s ice cream is the machinery. Compared to modern production techniques that pasteurize in minutes, UConn’s 1950s-style machines pasteurize the product overnight. That “gives us a really high butter fat content, which is generally your ice cream quality,” Haggerty said.
“It’s impossible to replicate the product,” he said.

While some may call it an obsession, the Behuns describe the deliberate approach they’ve taken to assembling their ice cream menu as thoroughness.
“In order to say, ‘Here are the best,’ you have to have tried them all,” Craig said.
It’s not the only thing the Behuns are obsessed with. 
The family has also ranked every mini-golf course in the state. And last winter they went to a game for every Division I men’s basketball team in Connecticut. This year, they have plans to visit a game for every team in Division II.
One of the Behuns’ family members has visited all of New Hampshire’s covered bridges. Michelle said Craig wasn’t interested in that. “My kids are spoiled,” she said.
After 10 years of ice cream adventures with Callan and his younger brother Ashton, 7, in tow, the Behuns were ready to get in gear and start their own business. They bought a truck from now-shuttered Tipsy Cones, and the family wrapped up refurbishing it in June.
Now the truck is making appearances at events across Connecticut and stocks flavors like peach melba, Graham jam, and Guinness chip. 
It’s a logistical challenge to transport so many flavors from different places while making sure they don’t melt. The Behuns drive all over the state for their pickups, storing the ice cream in a freezer bag in the car, then in chest freezers in their basement.
Michelle said she’s spent countless hours scouring Facebook’s Marketplace looking for chest freezers. The family now owns seven. 
Callan, whose favorite flavors are Twinkie, Cookie Monster and chocolate chip, said he enjoys scooping the tail ends of the large cartons into pint containers for the family’s kitchen freezer. 
The hardest part of reaching your hand into a 3-gallon tub? “You get sticky,” Callan said.
Opening an ice cream truck “was something that we wanted to do maybe down the road, but the opportunity kind of fell in our laps” with the Tipsy Cones truck, Michelle said. 
Craig and Michelle, who are both teachers, said some of their colleagues have provided support to the ice cream operation in exchange for free treats. An art teacher made the flavor signs for the truck, and the vice principal of the boys’ school invited them to vend at a back-to-school movie night earlier in August. 
For now, the Behuns said the priority is attending their kids’ baseball games. But they’ve set up shop at several events this summer and plan to continue through the fall. 
And, of course, baseball games often end with a scoop.
“We are pretty happy people,” Michelle said.
“Everybody’s pretty happy when we’re giving them ice cream,” added Craig.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0724_SR_CTIceCreamTour_069-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 12:57:10.178313
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,1.2M immigrants are gone from the US labor force under Trump,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/immigrants-us-labor-force/,"Preliminary data show a decline of over a million immigrant workers from January to July, according to Census data analyzed by Pew.","It’s tomato season and Lidia is harvesting on farms in California’s Central Valley.
She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.
“The worry is they’ll pull you over when you’re driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”
As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation’s labor force.
More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.
Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.
The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.
“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”
Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.
Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.
“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”
‘Crops did go to waste’
Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.
Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.
“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.
In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).
Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.
Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.
“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.
Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.
“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,” said Lidia. “I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”
From construction to health care
Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.
“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.”
The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.
“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”
Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.
The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local’s president.

Another Labor Day is upon us and in anticipation of that, Oxfam, the global nonprofit that works to fight inequality and end poverty and injustice, has released the seventh edition of its Best States to Work Index. The index tracks 27 policies across three dimensions—wages, worker protections, and rights to organize—that support low-wage workers and working families, and as has been the case for some time now, the index reports that North Carolina ranks among the worst states for all workers (and women workers in particular). And recently Newsline caught up with Oxfam America’s Senior Domestic Policy Advisor Patricia Stottlemyer to learn more.

Many American businesses are bracing for higher costs after President Donald Trump levied wide-ranging tariffs this spring, a move that economists have largely panned. But for workers in southeastern Michigan, the heart of the U.S. automotive industry, the story is a little more complicated. Here, manufacturing is “our lifeblood,” according to Sean Crawford, a skilled trades apprentice at General Motors’ Warren Tech Center in suburban Detroit.
A Trump critic, Crawford is mostly skeptical that tariffs will lead to more or better jobs. But Crawford’s co-workers have generally welcomed tariffs on foreign auto manufacturers, he said. As a third-generation autoworker, he understands the appeal. “They’re just happy something is being done,” he said.
Crawford grew up in Flint, Michigan, where he witnessed the loss of thousands of GM jobs decimate the town’s economy. For generations, manufacturing jobs helped people in the region build stable lives — purchase homes, raise families and end their careers with secure retirement.
Trump tapped into that manufacturing mythos when he vowed to make the country “a manufacturing nation once again” in his inauguration speech. He had repeated this message often on the campaign trail, promising to “create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.”
Yet rather than the promised manufacturing revival, the first eight months of Trump’s second term have brought uncertainty and upheaval. Widespread tariffs stalled hiring and rollbacks of clean energy policies have stymied investment and disrupted the fragile momentum that had been building under President Joe Biden, whose legislative agenda had spurred investment in manufacturing.
The fledgling growth of domestic manufacturing that had created more than 610,000 manufacturing jobs during the Biden administration and laid the groundwork for many more has “basically collapsed,” said Todd Tucker, director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute, a Washington-based, left-leaning think tank.
In fact, Trump was so dissatisfied with the weak July jobs report — which showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector had lost 37,000 jobs over three straight months — that he fired the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in early August, alleging on his social media platform Truth Social that the less-than-stellar job numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
*   *   *
Since the president first announced his sweeping tariffs, the country’s trade policy has been marked by chaos and volatility. The tariffs have been wielded for sharply different purposes, with some intended to protect domestic markets and others aimed at punishing foreign countries for actions Trump doesn’t like. That shifting rationale has deepened the sense of uncertainty, as have the constantly changing tariff rates. In addition, countries around the world have responded to the new trade regime with their own retaliatory tariffs.
“It’s almost impossible to keep up with the new deals, the new tariffs, the tariff cuts and the tariff hikes,” said Tucker. The instability is “the opposite of what companies need to be able to make long-term investments.”
That uncertainty has had a chilling effect on manufacturing. Many companies are pulling back from hiring simply because, amid the impulsive and erratic policymaking of the Trump administration, they don’t know what will happen next.
According to a second-quarter survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, just 55.4% of manufacturers are optimistic about the future of their companies — a 15-percentage-point drop since the first quarter and the lowest rating since the early days of the pandemic. Indeed, 89% of manufacturers surveyed said that operational costs have increased due to tariffs. While economists have criticized the broad reach of Trump’s tariffs, Tucker said that “select, strategic and targeted tariffs” could help some American industries.
Crawford’s union, the United Auto Workers, hopes that the 25% tariff on most foreign automakers will lead to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing and more stable jobs for autoworkers. (Japan, whose automakers hold a significant share of the U.S. market, recently negotiated its tariff rate down to 15% in a deal with the Trump administration.)
“[W]e do not support reckless chaotic tariffs on all countries,” UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in an April op-ed for Jacobin. But auto tariffs, he wrote, are “a first step in ending the free-trade disaster,” adding that “the automakers, the auto market, and corporate America can afford it.”
Crawford is not so sure tariffs are a winning strategy, even tariffs on foreign car makers.  “With the tariffs swinging as wildly as they are … I feel like a lot of [car] companies aren’t on firm footing,” he said. He said it’s possible that his job and workplace could benefit, adding that even one additional shift at a plant could create jobs that would be a boon to the local economy. But he doubts that tariffs will inspire companies to break ground on new facilities. Instead, he reasons that if companies pass off tariff costs onto consumers, demand will decline, and layoffs could follow.
Crawford’s concerns about layoffs have already been borne out. GM’s profit fell by more than $1 billion in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2024, a decline executives attributed in part to tariffs. The company temporarily laid off 200 workers at a factory in Detroit suburb Hamtramck in April (though GM representatives blamed “market dynamics,” not tariffs.) That same month, Stellantis laid off 900 workers following dismal quarterly earnings, and Volvo cut more than 1,000 workers at its Mack Truck plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.
At the same time, tariff pressures led GM to announce in April that the company would increase production at a plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and hire 225-250 temporary workers. But temporary workers earn lower pay than other hourly workers and also receive fewer benefits. Temporary status may not even be temporary; Crawford said he’s known temporary workers that have held “temporary” positions for as many as seven years. And that’s not including the workers hired by third-party agencies to do auto production work for companies like GM.
“Yeah, American manufacturing, rah rah rah,” Crawford said sarcastically. “But are those actually going to be good jobs? Are they going to be unionized jobs? Are they going to be family and community supporting jobs?”
If not, he thinks the rhetoric is just “emotionally exploiting” workers who want the secure and stable work manufacturing once promised.
*   *   *
While it remains to be seen how exactly auto manufacturing will be impacted by tariffs, clean energy manufacturing — which was growing rapidly under the Biden administration — has been hard hit by Trump’s industrial policy. Since the start of 2025, more than $18 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects have been cancelled, according to data from environmental business coalition E2. Those cancellations translate into thousands of jobs that will never materialize.
“We were on the cusp of an economic revolution the likes we haven’t seen in generations,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “Unfortunately, that is now at risk,” he said.
As just one example, more than 1,000 jobs were intended for union sheet metalworkers at a Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. site near Dayton, Ohio, that was set to transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen. Instead, the facility will continue to produce “beautiful coal,” with a goal to “operate fully under AI,” CEO Lourenco Goncalves said in a July earnings call. According to Steel Industry News, the AI operation is meant to increase efficiency for the company by 15%-20%.
“Automation is the name of the game” in many facilities, Babak Hafezi, adjunct professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business and CEO of international consulting firm Hafezi Capital, said in an email. He predicts companies will choose between two strategies if Trump’s trade policy stands: Use exclusively domestic materials alongside automation — in which cases workers are unlikely to benefit — or move production to the cheapest country possible. Either way, workers — and communities that rely on manufacturing — will lose, according to Hafezi.
Crawford believes a stronger labor movement is ultimately what will lead to a resurgence of American manufacturing jobs. It’s hard for workers to bargain for jobs when unions “don’t really have the same dominance in the auto sector like we used to,” he said. He is unsurprised that some manufacturing workers have welcomed tariffs, even if they may mean higher prices and fewer opportunities for other workers.
“People want jobs,” Crawford said. “That’s understandable.”

John Lewis (D-Ga.), on July 17, 2025. (Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)“A republic, if you can keep it.” With these words Benjamin Franklin is said to have described what delegates to the Constitutional Convention created in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787.
It could hardly be described as a democracy. The founders only gave 20% of the population — white men — a direct say in choosing the House of Representatives. Members of the United States Senate would be appointed by state legislatures (until 1913) and the president would be chosen by the Electoral College, an arcane device the founders invented that could override the will of the people as expressed in the popular vote.
It’s been 105 years since the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, and 60 years since the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in elections. Since then, the direct participation of the American people in the decision-making process has broadened and deepened at all levels — city, county, state and federal.
Many have watched the first months of the Trump administration with apprehension and growing concern, as federal programs, agencies and institutions established by act of Congress are defunded, dismantled and abolished, or their missions are redefined. Respected and experienced leaders and experts have been summarily dismissed and replaced without cause or justification.

In the context of this unfolding spectacle, a question is looming on the horizon: “What is the duty of an American citizen to resist arbitrary and capricious, reckless and illegal decisions?”
One rapidly approaching challenge to the rule of law is the U.S. Supreme Court’s consideration of the Trump administration’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to all persons born in the United States, a cornerstone of our Constitution.
My ancestors first came to the shores of America in the 1660s, more than a hundred years before the Revolution, but I am still a descendant of immigrants. Perhaps a line will be crossed if the Supreme Court capitulates, fails to reaffirm the sacred right of citizenship guaranteed to all children who are born here, and denies to some the rights, privileges and obligations which are the birthright of all Americans.
Anti-immigrant fervor is running high, and being exploited for political advantage. That’s nothing new in this country. We’ve seen episodes like this throughout our history. And we’ve seen the injustices perpetrated in its name, toward the Irish, Italians, Eastern Europeans, Jews, Asians, Haitians and many others. The photograph of the father and young son laying face down in the Rio Grande a few years ago is still etched in my memory.
Outsiders are an easy target for hate. It goes without saying that there are wrong-doers in every segment of society. Wholesale disregard for the law at the southern border was totally unacceptable and unsustainable. That said, immigrants have played a vital role in building our country and they make a contribution every day to the quality of life enjoyed by all Americans.
Truth is a subterranean river that flows beneath the glittering surface of things. When we set national policy we need to be in the truth business.
Since our founding, Americans have been the natural enemies of tyrants. This year, we have reflected on America’s indispensable role in defeating Hitler and the Nazis in Europe 80 years ago.
What we’ve been witnessing in Washington since the Jan. 20 inauguration is akin to a Roman Circus devoid of Roman Virtue. If the first months are any indication of what lies ahead, the time will come when men and women of character and integrity will face a moment of truth — when they are compelled by events to decide whether to comply or resist, to be silent or to speak out. Silent obedience and passive acceptance of unjust and illegal acts being perpetrated by our government, acting in our name, is not an option.
The United States of America is not perfect. As a student activist more than a half-century ago I protested racial injustice and the war in Vietnam. Our country has not always lived up to its ideals and principles, but I still believe in our capacity to do good in the world.
America is still a work in progress.  Our future success is not assured. But our fate is not yet sealed. It’s up to us. After almost 250 years, America is still an experiment — an idea — that on its best days has gripped the imagination of the world.  In the right hands it has the potential to be, as Lincoln said, “the last best hope of Earth.”
Whether America will be a great and a good country, under a Constitution that guarantees equal justice under law, built by people from every corner of the world working together to thrive and prosper in their pursuit of happiness, will be decided in the days, months and years ahead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lewis-6287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 10:57:12.793294

Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report.

Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.

Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 
California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Virginia-flooding.jpg,,,2025-09-01 10:57:12.793294

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Peniston is seeking judicial review of a 90-day license suspension, arguing the Iowa Board of Nursing improperly relied on her alleged confessions rather than citing care issues involving specific patients.
State records indicate Peniston — identified in most board records as “Penisten” — was first licensed in Iowa in 2006 as a registered nurse. She is also a licensed advanced practice nurse prescriber in the state of Wisconsin.

According to the Iowa Board of Nursing, Peniston was previously disciplined by the board in 2021, at which time she entered into a settlement agreement to resolve charges of improperly prescribing, dispensing, administering or distributing drugs; prescribing, dispensing, or administering drugs to individuals who are not patients or are outside the licensee’s specialty area; and improper delegation of nursing services.
The board alleged Peniston, “without any formal training for the service, (was) acting as a supervisor to a registered nurse providing Botox and dermal fillers.” Peniston allegedly allowed the nurse to order Botox and dermal fillers under her prescriptive authority, did not see the patients which received Botox or dermal fillers, and did not provide direction to the nurse on the drug’s administration.
The board required Peniston to stop supervising nurses who administered Botox and dermal fillers until she received specified training and 4.6 hours of training in professional accountability and legal liability.
On Aug. 23, 2023, the Board received a complaint concerning intravenous therapy services provided by a company based in Iowa called IV Therapy.
Through its investigation, the board confirmed that Peniston was the medical director for IV Therapy from November 2021 through September 2022, and was also serving as the medical director for at least two other “medical spas” in Iowa and Wisconsin. Peniston had also been running an aesthetics practice, Vivid Life Spa, since November 2021, and served as the medical director of Vivid IV, according to the board.
The board alleges Peniston admitted she did not meet with all of the spas’ Botox and IV patients, either in person or virtually. The board alleges she admitted that she reviewed documentation submitted online by the patients, and then other nurses administered treatments with the use of her guidelines and a set of standing orders that were not patient specific.
Board cites past issues with Botox patients
In December 2024, based on its findings, the board charged Peniston with professional incompetence. After a hearing on the matter, the board concluded Peniston failed to adhere to the standards of practice for advanced registered nurse practitioners.
The board found that while Peniston served as a medical director at multiple businesses that provided Botox injections and IV infusions, she admitted that she didn’t meet with patients in person or virtually to establish a patient-provider relationship, and admitted she did not perform an initial assessment or establish a plan of care as required by state regulations.
“The board is concerned that despite previous discipline related to her failure to meet with Botox patients prior to treatment, (Peniston) has continued to engage in this practice,” the board said in imposing a 90-day license suspension.
The board also ordered that upon reinstatement of her license, Peniston cease and desist from serving as a medical director for a medical spa and that she refrain from overseeing the provision of medical spa services in any facility.
In her newly filed court petition seeking judicial review of the board’s actions, Peniston argues that “not a single patient or case was identified” during her hearing and the board instead relied upon “hearsay and vague and overly general ‘admissions’” that were attributed to her.
“The state’s evidence failed to assert a violation of any single patient or case handled by Nurse Peniston,” the petition alleges. “The state did not introduce a single patient file, nor did the peer reviewer actually review any patient or case.”
The Board of Nursing has yet to file a response to the petition.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Earlier this year, Wit Tuttell and his colleagues at North Carolina’s Visit NC tourism office were carefully watching a key metric in their monthly surveys: how many tourists weren’t coming to the mountains because they thought they weren’t accessible.
North Carolina had for months been blasting out marketing under a campaign designed to bring business back to the area after Hurricane Helene. “The best way for us to get back is for you to come back,” ads pleaded to potential visitors.
Finally, a survey showed less than 10% of people sharing that sentiment — a key watermark. Visit NC pivoted and launched a new campaign: “Rediscover the Unforgettable.”
“We want people to remember what a great experience going to the North Carolina mountains was,” Tuttell told NC Newsline in an interview. “We want them to feel like they can rediscover that. Now is the time they can go back out there.”
In the first full year since the deadliest storm in North Carolina history, tourism has been overall “sluggish,” Tuttell said. He estimated that to date, 2025 spending was “about on par” or “down anywhere from 1-3%” from 2024.
That’s not solely because of the Helene recovery or a slowdown in visitors to the mountains. But those concerns have added yet another layer to a complex tourism landscape, increasingly driven by social media chatter and an uncertain economic future.
North Carolina’s tourism office has responded with almost $14 million in custom advertising campaigns over the past year. They’ve relied on data to adjust “delicate” messaging, luring visitors back while tapping a network of influencers to boost the region across social channels.
Now, even in a “softening” market for leisure travel, Tuttell said, North Carolina as a whole is “faring better than other destinations.”

 How VisitNC has pitched the mountains in the year since Helene

Just weeks after Helene flooded western North Carolina, some storefronts and communities — if they were able — opened back up for business. It wasn’t a choice so much as a necessity, in a region so heavily driven by tourism.
Visit NC’s first post-Helene tourism campaign was a cautious one, urging visitors to return and spend money in communities that needed it. But they were careful “not to overpromise.”
“It wasn’t going to be the typical mountain vacation,” Tuttell said. “People felt that they wanted to help, but they didn’t want to interfere. So we had to get the message across that going there wasn’t going to interfere.”
Those early months of advertising were targeted as much at in-state residents as visitors from across the country. That was by design: The state wanted to remind North Carolinians of their fondness for the region — and that their neighbors needed their help.
“We sort of played on their heartstrings with the first few messages,” Tuttell said. “Knowing that people love this area, and have an affinity toward it.”
After about six months, they pivoted to “Rediscover the Unforgettable” and blasted out images of Asheville’s breweries and restaurants, cycling and rafting in the Smokies and wineries in the High Country. The idea, Tuttell said, was to shift away from a recovery-focused message to a more inspirational one.
When all is said and done, the state is hoping to be able to use their current campaign for the Piedmont and the coast: “For Real, Visit North Carolina.”
“Elsewhere, kids are watching reels on a phone,” a narrator says in one ad for the campaign, as a young girl casts a line into the water at the Outer Banks.

Visit NC’s western marketing has been paid for almost entirely through money allocated by the legislature across multiple hurricane relief packages. That allowed the agency to shift money for their “inspirational campaign” to the Piedmont and the coast.
In 2024, 71 counties saw increased visitor spending from the year before, the Department of Commerce announced Wednesday. Among the counties that saw the biggest boosts: those neighboring Helene-impacted counties, where hundreds of workers and volunteers aiding in disaster relief stayed for weeks to months.

 Social media tourism — and its pitfalls for western NC

Earlier this summer, tourism officials met with a group of influencers and social media personalities in Asheville.
Ahead of “leaf season,” they’re hoping a steady clip of posts on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms will help spur more trips, from both returning and new visitors. Visit NC has formally contracted with a few creators through its advertising agency, while others are considered more informal partners.
But they’ll all be competing with a deluge of other posts and chatter, that Tuttell says have made selling a dominant tourism-focused message harder than ever.
“In the past, what we worried about was the Weather Channel sending a team out and Jim Cantore scaring people away on your TV screens,” said Tuttell, referencing the now-retired meteorologist who reported from the field during various hurricanes and disasters. “What we really saw with this storm is that there were 1,000 different people on their phones, posting videos to social networks, that had the most influence on people and visitation.”
The state saw a dip in sentiment about visiting the mountains around the six-month anniversary of Helene. Tuttell believes that was fueled in part by old videos of flooding and destruction that resurfaced online. And he’s expecting a similar dip next month, around the one-year anniversary.
Tourism officials have, however, been able to count on one prominent person to continue boosting the region: Gov. Josh Stein.
Stein has made the recovery and revitalization of the mountains a centerpiece of his first months in office. He’s made frequent visits out to impacted communities, shaking hands with local officials and business owners. And he made an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in June.
“The governor and the First Lady have been the biggest cheerleaders we’ve had for western North Carolina,” Tuttell said. “And boy has it been beneficial.”
Stein’s office has also leaned into more casual, social media-focused promotions.
One post featured a staffer handing him a disposable camera, before clicking through the images he took while on vacation in western North Carolina.
And when Donna Kelce — mother of the Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and soon to be mother-in-law to Taylor Swift — posted that she had visited Biltmore Estate in Asheville, Stein chimed in.
“Western NC is open for business (and a wonderful place for a wedding)!” Stein wrote.

(Photo by Dennis Schroeder/NREL)For years, urban Alaska utilities have been studying large-scale wind farms that could help break the state’s dependence on natural gas power — encouraged by the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits from the federal government.
Next summer, however, those tax credits will largely disappear for projects that haven’t started construction, a consequence of the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in July.
Clean energy advocates, and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, had said they hoped that Alaska wind projects could still advance in time to qualify.
But in recent weeks, board members and executives at the cooperatively owned utilities have acknowledged that the timeline now appears too short — which means any large-scale projects will now have to be built without the generous federal subsidies, or wait to see if Congress reestablishes a more favorable tax regime.
Critics say the absence of major new renewable projects will leave the state dependent on imported, liquefied natural gas and could make consumers vulnerable to price spikes.
“There’s an argument to be made that these electric cooperatives, whose boards have a fiduciary responsibility to the member-owners, have really frittered away one of the greatest opportunities they’ve ever had to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars of value to their members,” said Phil Wight, an energy historian and professor at University of Alaska Fairbanks. “At the highest level, I think that’s a fair argument.”
Since Congress approved expanded tax credits in 2022, Alaska has seen no large-scale wind or solar projects begin construction, while other states like Wyoming and Texas have received billions of dollars in clean energy investment.
At a recent meeting, board members at Golden Valley Electric Association, the utility that generates power for Fairbanks area residents and mines, rejected a developer’s bid to advance a large-scale wind farm on a schedule driven by the expiring tax credits. Utility officials said there was still too much uncertainty about final pricing and whether the project could capture the credits.
Meanwhile, officials at Anchorage-based Chugach Electric Association, the state’s largest power utility, say that another large wind project they’ve been studying with the same developer also won’t be ready to start construction in time to qualify for the credits.
Jim Nordlund, a Chugach Electric Association board member, said that if the Anchorage-area project had captured the credits, it was still far from clear that it could have provided power more cheaply than his utility’s existing natural gas plants.
That’s even assuming prices will rise when local fuel supplies dry up and utilities begin importing liquefied natural gas in the next few years, added Nordlund, a self-described clean energy advocate.
The price of renewable power generally, he said, “is really high.”
Alaskans who are frustrated about the pace of wind and solar development shouldn’t blame the urban utilities, Nordlund added. Private companies, not the utilities themselves, have been advancing projects that failed to materialize, he said, and politics also played a big role.
“If you want to blame anybody for this, it would be that big bad bill. That’s what Trump wanted to do, and it worked,” Nordlund said. “It shut down, at least for the time being, our projects.”
But renewable energy boosters say that the urban utilities deserve at least some share of the blame for not advancing projects more urgently while the tax credits were in place.
The utilities could have developed large wind developments themselves, those advocates argue — or they could have done more to create a stable and attractive market for private developers.
“The utilities are uniquely bureaucratic and expensive in their own self-development. And they’re uniquely bureaucratic and obstinate and slow if a private company is developing,” said Ethan Schutt, who formerly managed the energy assets of an Indigenous-owned regional corporation.
Advocates say utility leaders have also failed to endorse, and in some cases outright opposed, legislation proposed multiple times in recent years to establish renewable energy quotas — which they say could have encouraged more private developers to work in the state.
Large-scale power projects “need to be thoughtfully implemented,” Natalie Kiley-Bergen, energy lead at an advocacy organization called Alaska Public Interest Research Group, said in an email.
“Had more progress been made in the last five years — even the last 15 years — to create a competitive market environment with regulatory and economic certainty for these projects, we could have seen responsible project commitments regardless of federal changes,” Kiley-Bergen said. “Not capitalizing on these tax credits is a product of years of moving slowly on the tremendous opportunities to diversify our energy generation.”
A risk of price spikes?
After its initial discovery in the 1950s, Cook Inlet, the offshore and onshore petroleum basin southwest of Anchorage, produced huge quantities of natural gas.
There was enough fuel to generate not just the vast majority of the region’s electric power, but also to supply plants that produced fertilizer and exported gas in liquefied form to Asia.
But those plants have now closed amid Cook Inlet production declines. And for more than a decade, the urban electric utilities have been contending with risk that gas supply won’t be adequate to meet demand.
Generous state tax credits temporarily approved by lawmakers in 2010 helped stimulate new drilling, but only temporarily, and they were subsequently repealed. Three years ago, Cook Inlet’s dominant producer, Hilcorp, warned utilities that they should not expect new long-term commitments of gas when their existing contracts expire in the coming years.
Clean energy advocates say that Alaskans’ dependence on gas-fired power — Chugach Electric Association generates 87% of its power from the fuel — makes residents vulnerable to both supply disruptions and fluctuations in price.
The utilities have responded to the looming local gas shortfall with plans for new infrastructure that could offload imported liquefied natural gas, known as LNG, shipped from Canada or the Gulf of Mexico.
But unlike gas from Cook Inlet, which producers have long sold at a fixed cost, utilities would likely have to buy LNG at rates that swing with the market, similar to the price of oil, according to Antony Scott, an analyst at the Renewable Energy Alaska Project advocacy group who once studied petroleum pricing for Alaska’s state government.
Given the risk of price spikes that could translate into higher electricity prices for consumers, diversifying with new wind and solar development should be a “no-brainer,” Scott said.
“It’s just like an investment portfolio. Do you want to invest only in Tesla?” Scott said. “A rational, prudent investor would have a diversified portfolio.”
Scott’s advocacy group, and others in Alaska, have pushed the utilities to diversify, in part through lobbying for the creation of the renewable energy quotas.
They cite analyses like a study released last year by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which found that new renewables would be cheaper than burning gas in existing plants and, by 2040, could meet up to 80% of demand.
“Ratepayers in Alaska have been saying, for a long time, that we need renewable energy projects here at home, and we need to be capturing energy here at home,” said Alex Petkanas, clean energy and climate program manager at the Alaska Center conservation group. “This is not something that is a surprise — that our local natural gas supply is ending, and we need to replace that with new generation.”
A rejected agreement
Utility staff and board members agree that they need to diversify away from gas, with the chief executive of Matanuska Electric Association saying in 2022 that it was “untenable” to continue generating 85% of power from one type of fuel.
Chugach Electric Association aims to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2040, which would likely require sharp reduction in its use of natural gas. And a Golden Valley Electric Association strategic plan approved last year calls for the utility to finalize agreements with private developers to bring on “large-scale wind resources” at prices that will lower members’ power costs.
None of those utilities have moved to build major wind or solar farms themselves; instead, they’ve looked to private companies to do the construction and sell the power onto the grid.
Just one firm, Longroad Energy, has advanced large-scale wind projects on a timeline that could have qualified for the expiring tax credits. One is outside Anchorage in Chugach Electric Association’s region, and one is outside Fairbanks, in Golden Valley Electric Association’s region.
The Fairbanks area project, known as Shovel Creek Wind, could produce one-third of the power consumed by Golden Valley’s members — and even generate more than 100% of their demand at certain times, depending on the size of the development, said Golden Valley’s chief executive, Travis Million.
But at a July board meeting, Golden Valley’s board members rejected an agreement that Longroad had proposed to keep the project on a timeline to qualify for the credits.
Golden Valley, said Million, still needed more time to finish a study of how much it would have to spend on infrastructure upgrades and its existing fossil fuel plants in order to accommodate power from the new wind project. Utilities must balance swings in power production that stem from the natural variability of wind.
“Without having that step done, there’s just so much uncertainty about the cost. And not knowing what that end result would be to our members, we just could not commit,” Million said in a recent interview. The details of the proposed agreement — including Longroad’s estimated pricing — are confidential under a non-disclosure agreement.
There was additional uncertainty, Million added, about whether the Trump administration, which has been hostile to wind power, would grant the credits even if Shovel Creek advanced on the required timeline.
But Million also acknowledged that the utility could have done more work earlier to speed up the process.
“We should have done a lot of these studies on the front end, to really understand sizing and needs on Golden Valley’s system, before we really started going down this path with trying to find developers,” Million said.
Longroad, through an Anchorage-based consultant, declined to comment. Million said that Golden Valley plans to finish its study and hasn’t ruled out advancing Shovel Creek on a slower timeline than Longroad’s proposal.
The utility is also studying a substantial, if smaller, wind project that could still qualify for the tax credits.
“We have to take control”
In Anchorage, meanwhile, officials with Chugach Electric Association said that Longroad’s work on the nearby Little Mount Susitna wind project slowed as the company focused on advancing Shovel Creek.
The developer, said Chugach board member Nordlund, isn’t ready to make the initial investment in Little Mount Susitna and couldn’t do the continuous work required in order to take advantage of the tax credits — though the utility, he added, hasn’t given up on the project moving forward in the future.
Nordlund ran for the Chugach board in 2023 as an advocate for wind and solar, saying then that “the time to act on renewables is now.”
But he said in a recent interview that there’s “misinformation” circulating that utilities are dismissing proposed wind and solar developments that would generate power more cheaply than natural gas, when that’s not clearly the case.
Chugach has its own non-disclosure agreement with Longroad that Nordlund said bars him from getting specific about prices.
But speaking generally, he added, Alaska is a tough market for private developers, compared to the Lower 48 and foreign countries where they otherwise might invest.
Construction costs in Alaska are higher given the remote setting, harsh environment and lack of contractors competing for business, Nordlund said; the relatively small consumer base also means that developers can’t capture economies of scale.
“I think we need to create a better climate for independent power producers to do business in Alaska,” Nordlund said. The stalled legislation to establish renewable energy quotas could have helped, he added, by giving those private developers more certainty that the utilities were “serious” about bringing on wind and solar projects.
“More could have been done,” he said.
Nonetheless, Nordlund said he thinks the inherently “conservative” culture of Alaska’s utilities is changing, with executives increasingly open to accommodating wind and solar power.
Chugach officials say the utility is still pursuing renewables and remains open to proposals from developers — though they are now refocusing on more modest projects that they can advance in-house, at least in the early stages. Viable projects could then, potentially, be handed off to private developers.
At meetings in recent weeks, board and staff members have discussed a small-scale solar farm that Chugach is studying at the site of one of its existing gas power plants on the far side of Cook Inlet.
They’ve also heard a presentation from a consultant who is examining potential sites for new hydroelectric development, though those projects would face a lengthy permitting process.
“We now have to take control and get in the lead,” Dustin Highers, Chugach’s vice president for corporate programs, said at a recent board meeting.
But some experts like Wight, the energy historian, remain skeptical that those efforts will end up displacing very much gas, with the exception of the smaller wind project in the Fairbanks area that he said could still “make a real difference.”
Pursuing smaller projects with better coordination between regions could be a better strategy, Wight said. But failing that, he said he expects utilities to largely continue their dependence on natural gas — whether through imported LNG, or through a proposed pipeline project from Alaska’s North Slope that’s struggled to secure commitments from investors.
“They’re going to dabble a little bit in renewables here and there, and then they’re just going to hope for cheap gas,” Wight said. “As a state, we’ve been so oil- and gas-dependent for so long that I do think there’s a cultural barrier there, to bring in the new folks who want to think differently.”

Organizers say the One Mississippi gathering at 100 Men Hall aims to “show the world what real community looks like.”
The Sept. 28 event will have food, live music and indoor and outdoor activities, including  karaoke, storytelling, limbo contests, sack races and tug-o-war.

“We’re calling it ‘where neighbors meet and compete,’ but really it’s where they play together,” said Rachel Dangermond, owner and director of 100 Men Hall.
Bay St. Louis was among the communities hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Organizers of One Mississippi say they want to promote unity and “not wait for a natural disaster to show our neighbors we’re with them.” 
Dangermond said she was inspired by current political and social unrest to unite people across all differences. Though the hall strives to celebrate cultural diversity and inclusivity, One Missississippi is meant to bring in those who don’t normally attend the hall’s concerts or other events.
“We want everyone to feel welcome — we believe that everyone should feel welcome,” she said. “But I think that there is more and more, this division that’s happening in our society, and so a lot of people don’t feel comfortable here. And so we want to have an event that invites everyone in, to do things that everyone can do, that is for everyone.”
100 Men Hall has cultural and historical significance to Bay St. Louis.
Bought in 1922 by the One Hundred Members’ Debating Benevolent Association, the hall became a multipurpose space and a popular stop on the Chitlin Circuit, an informal network of entertainment venues for Black performers. Famous blues, jazz and soul entertainers including Etta James, Big Joe Turner and Ray Charles performed there.

The original One Hundred Members’ Debating Benevolent Association disbanded in 1984, and the hall changed ownership multiple times. Dangermond bought it in 2018, and now runs it as a multipurpose space and cultural center. She also established 100 Women DBA, a nonprofit that supports the 100 Men Hall and provides scholarships and mentorships to local women of color.
“I thought, what we needed to do, most importantly, was to remind everybody in this community about who we are,” Dangermond said.

Dangermond describes Bay St. Louis as a small, artsy town. It  is home to a variety of events, many of which are hosted at 100 Men Hall. 
Honey Parker does marketing and advertising for One Mississippi and will host a story slam, where people can share five-minute anecdotes that fit the theme “Only in Mississippi.”
Parker hopes not only to celebrate those in Bay St. Louis, but also to be an example for other places.
“Hopefully, people who come to the event will see what we have here. We have such a fantastic community that is across the spectrum,” Parker said. “It’s to celebrate that, it’s to remind each other that, ‘Yeah, we have a heck of a community.’”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29110647/Exterior-photograph-of-100-Men-Hall-in-Bay-St.-Louis-Miss.-Credit-David-Lewis.jpg,,,2025-09-01 09:56:31.267731

Source NM talks to attendees — and politicians —about their glooms.","the 101st burning of Zozobra on Aug. 29, 2025 had a steampunk theme. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)For the 101st iteration of the Burning of Zozobra, organizers took the 50-foot effigy back to the future. Each year leading up to the 100th anniversary celebrated a decade of the annual tradition’s history thematically — from music to Old Man Gloom’s attire. This year, Zozobra went steampunk.
“It was the perfect fit,” Zozobra Event Chairman Ray Sandoval said in an interview several hours before the burn. “This is Zozobra’s turn of the century, and Steampunk is all about the turn of the century — from the 1800s to the 1900s— and the optimism about where technology could take you.” 
Zozobra’s hat and goggles gave the marionette a new look this year, but the big innovation came via his right hand, which this year was robotic and dexterous (Sandoval said the crew troubleshot a potentially offensive finger motion and avoided a “limb malfunction”).
The Santa Fe Kiwanis Club has stewarded Zozobra, originally created in 1924 by Santa Fe artist William “Will” Howard Shuster Jr., since 1964. A large group of volunteers oversees its annual creation, including sewing his outfits. That brings some mental challenges, seamstress Carol McGiffin. She brings a vast background in theater and costuming to the task, but she says sewing Zozobra’s outfits doesn’t fit any mold. “It’s not really costume, and it’s not really set construction and it’s not really set decorating,” she said. “I’ve done all of that, but it’s some kind of weird melding. It’s interesting. I like the way he looks.” (McGiffin said she did not have any gloom to share).
Zozobra’s look may change from year to year, but the event’s fundamental mix of art, community and collective catharsis has never altered. The puppet is filled and surrounded by glooms in myriad forms. This writer has volunteered for many years at the event table at which attendees bring their glooms in physical form — X-rays, bank notes, old photographs — and at which they take pen to paper to write them down. For 2025, Source solicited online glooms in advance of the burning (which we brought to the event for incineration), and we took to the field at the event on Friday to talk with people about what glooms they had come to purge. The answers we received ran from the personal to the political — with the elected officials and political candidates with whom we spoke landing harder on the latter.
For Sandoval, gloom came in the form of public outcry over the removal of 12 Siberian Elms at Fort Marcy Park for the event, which he said opponents mischaracterized as a last-minute undertaking that had actually begun with outreach years ago.
“My gloom is that we don’t talk to each other anymore,” Sandoval said. “We are so buried in our devices that we we’ve lost the ability to think, we’ve lost the ability to communicate, we’ve lost the ability to empathize and we’ve lost the ability to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. That is the one of the most dangerous things, because a society that can’t do that does not function.” He’s sorry, he said, “that I got heck about trees, but this event means the world to me, and these events remind us that we can put our devices down. We can be with ourselves. We can dance. We can have joy with one another. We can commiserate with one another. It reminds us of our own humanity.”










My gloom is that we don't talk to each other anymore.

After dropping off glooms, attendee Grace Wood said she had written down losing her job this year. Adrian Salazar’s gloom: “It’s just the current state of the world,” he said. Sarah Andrews was visiting from California, but knew about Zozobra because she formerly lived in Las Cruces. She wrote down gloom, she said between tears, for the recent lost her sister-in-law, her pain over her brother’s anguish, and the death of her father last year. 
Santa Fe Kiwanis Club President Ned Harris understands the role Zozobra can play in personal grief. His late wife Elizabeth was Zozobra’s official seamstress before her death in 2022, and the year after he burned a packet of the condolence cards he received. This year, he said, his gloom took on a more aspirational form, he said. “Just things that I hope for myself, my community, my state, my country — from the ridiculous to the sublime.”

I’m hoping that we can all come together as a city, as a state, as a country, and help support those who are more vulnerable than ourselves,” she said, adding: “I would also say my own personal gloom, of course, is, the challenges that I faced in my own recovery.”
Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, one of the Democratic contenders for the state’s next governor, also cited “the people struggling in New Mexico” as his gloom. “The things that we need to do to make sure that they don’t continue to struggle, whether it’s education or health care and people suffering with illness that aren’t getting medical care.”

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Deputy Director of Communications Jodi McGinnis, who also is a long-time Zozobra volunteer who has worked on the seamstress team the last few years, summed up her gloom succinctly: HR1, the federal legislation otherwise known as the One Big Beautiful Act, which contains cuts to Medicaid and other programs expected to hit New Mexico particularly hard.
“I won’t call it that,” McGinnis Porter said of the “big beautiful bill” moniker. “I call it HR1, the GOP budget bill, and that’s what I put in my gloom box.” 
Santa Fe County Commissioner Justin Greene, who is running to be the next mayor of Santa Fe, also cited the federal government. “Sadly, the gloom comes from outside of Santa Fe,” he said. “Right now we have to deal with stuff on the federal level that we can’t deal with here locally.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, the Democrat who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Santa Fe, also identified the Trump administration as her gloom.

“My gloom was that we elected Trump, because all of the despair and masked men pulling people off the streets and the attack on our education and our beautiful people and culture. But you know what? Santa Fe knows how to deal with that. When he has fears, we choose joy. And when he has division, we choose community and unity, and then when he chooses darkness, we fight it with fire and light,” she said.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, also a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 gubernatorial race, said some of her gloom was the “stress of moving and packing.” As for the political climate: “The gloom  in Washington, DC.— I don’t know if there’s a Zozobra big enough to burn it up,” she said, “but the way that we fight Trump is by working hard right here in New Mexico for the people we love and care about.”

Not everyone brought gloom to burn, though. New Mexico native, retired Army Sergeant and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Leroy A. Petry, upon whom former President Barack Obama bestowed the honor in 2011 for his service in Afghanistan, said he was home to attend the celebration, and was happy to be there with his father and brothers.

“This is a childhood memory of mine,” he said. “I haven’t really been home to see my family in a long time, and it’s just such a happy day for me.” Petry, 46, added that he “let go of all my gloom a long time ago, after I got injured. I lost my hand, I got shot through my legs, I had a heart attack last year. All these challenges and adversity keep coming into my life, but every day that I wake up and I open my eyes, I know I’m blessed with another day. So I don’t carry the gloom around with me. I let it go every night when I go to bed.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Zozofeature2-1024x684.png,,,2025-09-01 08:57:02.318060

A handful more agencies are now under orders from the White House to terminate their collective bargaining agreements with federal unions.
In an executive order signed Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump (R) added more agencies and a few agency components to an already extensive list of federal entities slated for collective bargaining cancellations. Trump said the terminations of labor contracts are intended “to enhance the national security of the United States.”
Trump’s initial executive order from March 27 invoked a narrow, rarely used portion of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act that allows a president to suspend collective bargaining for national security purposes. The White House said the additional agencies it’s now directing to cancel collective bargaining agreements all have missions dealing with national security as well.
The agencies that Trump’s existing anti-union orders now cover are NASA; the U.S. Agency for Global Media; the National Weather Service and the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service — both within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Bureau of Reclamation’s hydropower program; and the Patent and Trademark Office’s commissioner of patents office.
Trump said in his executive order that the agencies and agency components newly tacked onto the anti-collective bargaining list all have “as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.” The agencies that Trump deemed no longer eligible for collective bargaining join many others, which the Office of Personnel Management listed out in March 27 guidance.
OPM: Trump’s hiring questions ‘mandatory’ to ask, but optional to answer

The White House did not immediately respond to Federal News Network’s request for clarification on why these specific agencies were not part of the initial March order, or why they are being added to the list at this time.
American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley said the union would have an “immediate response” to Trump’s new executive order and vowed to continue fighting in court for its members.
“This latest executive order is another clear example of retaliation against federal employee union members who have bravely stood up against his anti-worker, anti-American plan to dismantle the federal government,” Kelley said Thursday evening.
“Several agencies including NASA and the National Weather Service have already been hollowed out by reckless DOGE cuts, so for the administration to further disenfranchise the remaining workers in the name of ‘efficiency’ is immoral and abhorrent,” Kelley said.
The new executive order follows months of the Trump administration’s efforts to erode union rights for federal employees, while also overhauling civil service protections more broadly. In a fact sheet issued Thursday, the White House argued that collective bargaining at agencies dealing with national security work “can create delays in agency operations.”
“President Trump is taking action to ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their missions without delay and protect the American people,” the White House wrote. “The President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.”
Federal unions, however, have argued that collective bargaining benefits agency missions, rather than detracting from them. Many have also pointed out that Trump’s orders to cancel collective bargaining across much of the federal workforce swept up many agencies with missions that have nothing to do with national security.
Multiple federal unions, including AFGE, quickly sued the administration over the president’s actions earlier this year. While about half a dozen lawsuits remain ongoing, several agencies have already moved forward with terminating their union contracts after an appeals court decision green-lit agencies to begin implementing Trump’s orders from March.
The departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, among others, recently “de-recognized” many of their federal union chapters, revoked official time and reclaimed office space from union representatives.

Alabama was traditionally one of the South’s more unionized states, due to its long manufacturing heritage. But union membership has declined in the state. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership in Alabama declined from 156,000 workers — about 7.5% of the state’s 2.1 million workers — to 140,000, about 6.6% of the state’s workforce, in 2024.
Holton said the union has between 3,500 and 5,000 members. Its goal, he said, is to fight for the employees of the base to be “normal.”
“They’re not going to have to work double and triple and another job, and they can go spend the time watching their children play ball like everyone else in the world,” Holton said. “To be able to go out and be volunteer coaches, to be able to be someone in our community that is there all the time that are actually contributing. You’re not stuck at work all the time doing things that you don’t want to do.”
He said he is frustrated with lawmakers and politics in the South because the union is at a military base. He said it seems that Democrats are for unions, but against military growth, but Republicans are the opposite.
“What is wrong with not having to work two jobs? What’s wrong with having the ability to retire a pension plan? What is wrong with having safety standards? What is wrong with those things? It doesn’t have to be a left or a right side,” Holton said. “In my mind, it needs to be a decency side. What is decent for human beings, your people, your workers, people that are the backbone of this country?”
Holton said that there would probably be more unionization in the state if people realized that the issues unions usually fight for – fair hours and wages – are faced by their coworkers.
“I think a lot of times people forget we can grow our own allies by starting with … there’s a lot of brilliant people I know right there on the floors beside us,” Holton said. “They are working the same kind of jobs, worrying about the same things: Are they going to pay the rent or are they going to take their baby to the doctor?”
Holton’s goals at IAM are similar to those of Lance Ingwersen, the co-chair of United Campus Workers of Alabama, Local 3821 (CWA) at Jacksonville State University. The campus union launched two years ago, joining chapters at Auburn University and the University of Alabama. Since the launch, Ingwersen and his colleagues have been fighting for a livable wage for JSU’s hourly employees, per the Livable Wage Calculator by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Through that campaign, the campus’ custodial staff – among the lowest paid hourly workers, save for student workers – starting wage has increased about 15% from $9.09 per hour to $10.45 per hour, he said.
“It’s still well below the $15 and then later $17 that we’ve been pushing for those workers,” Ingwersen said. “That’s still the primary focus of our work on campus is just trying to get fairer wages for those hourly workers.”
According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a livable wage in Calhoun County, where JSU is located, for a family of three where both parents are working is $18.53 per hour.
CWA’s biggest challenge, though, is advertising its existence. Under a university policy, Ingwersen said, “Protected Expressive Activities” that are not sponsored by the university can only assemble in two places on campus.
“It’s very murky, so it’s really hard to let people know,” Ingwersen said. “We have to rely on things like social media and other stuff.”
For CWA and IAM, it has become a reminder that you should earn fair pay for the work you do.
“If a man or a woman goes, and they put in a hard day’s work, they deserve the wage that they deserve because they are the reason you are successful,” Holton said of companies.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pro-union-sign-for-Sept-25-2024-story.jpg,,,2025-09-01 08:57:02.318060

Wildfire veterans say an immigration raid last week targeting fire crews in Washington state was an alarming development that could threaten the nation’s wildfire readiness. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state last week and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotas. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid on Wednesday took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota is a good place to be a worker, with higher wages and union density than the nation along with lower unemployment. But there are growing challenges. Housing costs are rapidly increasing, child care is among the most expensive in the country, and an aging workforce threatens economic growth while straining taxpayers tasked with caring for those who need it.
President Trump’s agenda of massive federal cuts, high tariffs and immigration crackdowns has frozen the job market in uncertainty, and Minnesota’s jobless rate reached the highest level in nearly four years this summer.
Here are five charts on the state of labor in Minnesota.
Wages are higher in Minnesota than most other states


Minnesotans earn the highest average hourly wages in the Midwest — and the 8th highest in the country — while enjoying a relatively low cost of living compared to the coasts.
The average Minnesota worker earned $37.58 per hour in 2024, compared to $32.66 nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For most, that’s more than enough to meet the basic cost of living — housing, food, transportation and health care — with money left over to go out to dinner, save for retirement and take a vacation.
According to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development’s cost of living calculator, a single person with no kids needs to earn around $18 an hour while a family of four with one working parent needs to earn around $33 per hour to afford the basics.
Wages have generally matched or outpaced inflation over the past several decades. Although high inflation coming out of the pandemic eroded many workers’ buying power, wage growth has since caught up. Low-wage workers — particularly those in nursing homes and food service — benefited the most from a tight labor market, which has pushed wages up much more quickly than inflation in recent years.
Even so, rising costs for housing and child care are stretching family budgets and souring many workers’ view of the economy. The median income is enough to afford the median-priced home in the state, but rents and home prices have been rising faster than incomes.
Child care is also more expensive in Minnesota than most other states, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute. On average, infant care in Minnesota costs $22,000 per year — about 20% of the median household income.
Minnesotans are working and finding jobs
Minnesotans are working — or looking for work — at some of the highest rates in the country with a labor force participation rate of 68.2% compared to 62% nationally. Unemployment — the share of people looking for work — is also lower than the national average.
The share of adults working rose steadily through the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, as more and more women entered the workforce. Women in Minnesota work at some of the highest rates in the country, though the price of child care and persistent gender pay gap means women are more likely than men to stay at home to care for children or other family members.
The labor force participation rate has not returned to pre-pandemic levels of around 70%, in large part because many older workers retired in the pandemic and never reentered the workforce.
The continual aging of the population foreshadows difficulties in the labor market ahead. Employers will have to raise wages, but they will also need to lean into automation and hope the state can attract more out-of-state migrants or immigrants.
Union membership is high compared to the rest of the country
Minnesota consistently has among the highest rates of union representation in the country owing to its pro-labor tradition and relatively favorable organizing laws. The higher unionization rate contributes to the state’s relatively high median wages.
High union membership doesn’t just benefit union workers. Research shows that as union membership increases in a given industry, so do nonunion wages because of increased pressure on employers to raise pay.
Still, the story of unionization in Minnesota and the nation as a whole has been one of steady decline over the past half century. More than 20% of Minnesota workers were represented by a union in 1990 compared to less than 15% today.
Union leaders blame the decline on federal laws hostile to organizing and a lack of meaningful enforcement against unfair labor practices. While unions have been enjoying a surge in popularity since the pandemic, enthusiasm alone has yet to change the long-term decline of union membership.
Income inequality persists


By some measures, income inequality got worse in the pandemic years, with the top 10% of earners taking home 37% of Minnesota’s total income in 2023, up from 35% in 2020. Meanwhile, the bottom 10% of earners take home a meager 1.9% of the state’s income, a figure that has stayed more or less the same for the past decade.
Minnesota’s Gini coefficient — a metric of inequality that ranges from 0, representing exact equality, to 1, representing one person making all the money — has also gotten slightly higher in recent years but remains the same or lower than our neighboring states.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis has yet to publish state-level data on income distribution for 2024 and 2025, so we’ll have to wait to see whether high wage growth for lower-income workers will help address inequality in Minnesota.
Education, health services and construction jobs are growing
Despite a slowdown in jobs recently — with over four thousand jobs lost in July — Minnesota has seen a 1.1% increase in jobs over the past year, a little more than the nationwide 0.9%.
The highest job growth is in education, health services and construction. Elementary and secondary school employment growth is especially strong, with an 8% increase in jobs since last year. Meanwhile, the financial and information sectors have seen a loss in jobs, with the state’s telecommunications sector losing nearly 5% of its jobs, in line with national trends of layoffs at telecom companies from organizational restructuring and possibly AI automation.
Government job growth has also slowed down from last year, especially at the federal level, as Trump slimmed the federal workforce through mass buyoffs and layoffs. Minnesota’s federal workforce saw a sharp downturn in the month of April — a loss of 500 jobs — coinciding with the timing of a second wave of buyout offers from the administration.
“We may now be seeing results of mass federal layoffs and funding interruptions, erratic tariffs and shrinking immigration,” said Matt Varilek, the Commissioner of Minnesota’s Department of Employment and Economic Development, in a recent press release.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230001-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How are CT schools funded? What to know about the ECS formula,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/ct-education-cost-sharing-formula-ecs/,"Critics say the Education Cost Sharing grant, which represents CT's chief operating assistance for schools, has lagged inflation for years.","Connecticut children are now back to school and state government is making an unprecedented investment in their education this year — at first glance.
But while the Education Cost Sharing grant, the formula that represents the state’s chief operating assistance for local school districts, will dedicate almost $2.5 billion to local districts this fiscal year, more than 10% of the General Fund, critics say the program has lagged inflation for years, causing huge disparities in school funding between wealthy and poor communities to worsen. 
Here’s what you need to know about a problem that has befuddled legislators, governors and courts for decades.
How does the ECS formula work?
Though it never has created parity in school funding, the ECS formula is designed to move Connecticut closer toward equality.
And it begins with a “foundation” level, a basic assumption that it costs about $11,525 to educate one student in Connecticut.
From there, the formula adjusts this per pupil expenditure based on how many students a district serves from low-income households. It particularly focuses on pupils who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals or who speak English as a second language.
It also considers a city or town’s wealth in two ways, looking at the value of its taxable property as well as the income of its residents.
Hoping to encourage cooperation and efficiency savings, the state also provides a bonus to towns that send students to regional school districts.
Has the state always had the ECS formula?
Historically, Connecticut left cities and towns to rely chiefly on their local property taxpayers to fund K-12 education. And while the state developed some of the richest communities, and some of the poorest, in the nation, its approach to school funding remained unchanged. 
But the Connecticut Supreme Court, in its 1977 landmark ruling in Horton v. Meskill, found that dysfunctional funding system violated the right to an education guaranteed in the state Constitution. Justices also concluded, however, that creating a more equitable approach was the legislature’s job.
Anticipating this ruling, the legislature had acted in 1975 to create the first weighted state grant system, the Guaranteed Tax Base formula. It was modified into the Education Cost Sharing system in 1988, as legislators merged that program with an ongoing effort to boost teachers’ salaries statewide.
Neither the GTB nor ECS legislation guarantee that all districts would enjoy equal funding — through a combination of local property tax dollars and increasing state grants. And Connecticut never has achieved such parity.
What factors have impacted the ECS formula?
Connecticut’s pension debt often has gotten in the way of equal education funding.
Governors and legislatures dating back to the late 1930s failed to save adequately for these benefits, leaving the state billions in debt. By the 1990s, mandatory pension contributions began surging significantly, gobbling up resources that could have gone for education and other programs.
That wouldn’t stabilize until 2017, when officials began refinancing that pension debt, stretching out payment plans and pushing some debt onto future generations of taxpayers.
Lawmakers took two more key steps that same year: crafting new budget caps to increase surpluses, which would be used to pay down pension debt even faster; and ordering a multi-year plan to beef up the ECS.
But pensions got a much bigger slice of the budget pie.
Since 2017, surpluses have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year. The ECS program is up about $450 million from eight years ago, and critics say the growth is far too modest to compensate for decades of stagnant funding.
Has the ECS formula kept up with inflation?
No.
The School and State Finance Project, a Connecticut-based education policy group, estimates the ECS system would distribute an extra $99 million this fiscal year were the foundation level alone adjusted to reflect inflation.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign in March attacking Gov. Ned Lamont — a big defender of existing savings programs. CCM estimates ECS grants, adjusted for inflation, have declined by more than $400 million since Lamont took office in 2019.
“Local leaders are being asked to do more with less, and the state’s leadership needs to be honest about the challenges our communities face,” CCM Executive Director and CEO Joe DeLong said. “It’s time for real solutions that provide stable, predictable and sufficient funding for our cities and towns, not just political talking points.”
Lamont countered that he’s tried to grow both education and general government aid to municipalities while still whittling down tens of billions of dollars in pension debt that he inherited.
“My budgets prioritized significant municipal aid investments because that funding is about more than ensuring our unique towns and cities are incredible places to live, but because that funding supports our children’s education and gives them the best opportunity at the starting line in life,” Lamont said in March.
What is ‘hold harmless’ and how does it impact ECS? 
And as state officials try to balance municipal aid and pension obligations, a third issue also clouds the future of the ECS program.
Will Connecticut have to begin cutting education grants for some communities to increase them for others?
For decades, legislators and governors largely have resisted this option, even if the ECS formula called for a district to take a cut because of great wealth, declining student enrollment or a mix of factors.
This “hold harmless” approach — ensuring no district received less state funds one year than the prior year — was tested this past spring.
Lamont recommended that legislators stick to the formula they had adopted, boosting the program by more than $80 million in 2025-26 — but allowing more than 80 communities to receive less funds and collectively lose slightly less than $10 million.
But state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, asked lawmakers to keep “hold harmless” alive for now, arguing the ECS formula is flawed and would otherwise punish some many poor, rural towns in her district in New London County.
Many rural poor communities marked by high unemployment, public assistance caseloads and local property tax rates have declining student populations. But, Osten noted, most are midsized to large geographically. That means even if their schools lose some students, they can’t easily cut costs by merging classes or closing schools.
 “That’s saying those communities don’t count,” Osten said.
Legislators ultimately opted to spare those 80-plus districts from ECS cuts for another two fiscal years, but are expected to resume the “hold harmless” debate soon.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0521_SR_TeacherArrests_091-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

The agency recently issued new guidance on COVID-19 that advocates fear will lower vaccinations, though officials insist anyone who wants the vaccine can still get it. (Photo courtesy FDA)Five years after COVID-19 hit the United States, officials can largely anticipate how the virus will operate and, with available vaccines, antivirals and at-home tests, the natural seasonal rise in cases is more manageable than at the peak of the pandemic.
But public health advocates and researchers worry that recent “mixed messaging” from the federal level on who should get the new batch of COVID-19 vaccines may disrupt that progress.
“Mixed messaging results in people being confused. It will increase vaccine hesitancy and will undermine our nation’s ability to adequately protect ourselves from COVID,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “We’re seeing some confusion. I think part of the confusion is not knowing what the precise recommendations are.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved an updated COVID-19 vaccination for seniors and those with health issues that suppress their immune system – a change from previous vaccine guidance that recommended the shot for everyone older than 6 months.
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a follow-up social media post that the latest FDA approval is not “limiting availability” of the vaccine to anyone, and those who want it could still get it.
That said, it will likely be harder to get a COVID-19 shot if it’s not widely recommended, as insurance carriers may not cover the cost of the vaccine. Those who want the shot may need to go through additional administrative hurdles to get it.
“There’s a great deal of confusion and a lack of clarity about the vaccinations,” Benjamin said. “Their (FDA) communication has been so confusing that people aren’t sure quite how to get it … I don’t personally think they are following the science in their recommendations.”
Five years later, COVID-19 cases in Maryland top 1.5 million, health department reports

Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, says the new recommendations are not based on any changes in the COVID-19 virus.
“What’s changed is the political will to utilize vaccines. We have a secretary of Health and Human Services who has clearly not supported vaccines in the past,” Pekosz said of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted vaccine skeptic.
“What you’re seeing with the government recommendations now are exactly that kind of attitude,” Pekosz said.
Top medical societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, are pushing back on federal COVID recommendations. On Aug. 19, the AAP recommended that “all young children ages 6-23 months get vaccinated against COVID-19, along with older children in certain risk groups.”
“Whenever people are confused about an issue or they don’t think they understand it, the default is to not do something,” Pekosz said. “And in this case … people will not be getting the vaccine simply because they are not sure if they should or shouldn’t because of the mixed messaging.”
He noted that COVID-19 cases in Maryland are starting to rise, but other places are seeing faster increases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that COVID-19 infections were “growing or likely growing” in 31 states. That included Maryland, where the CDC reported that the number of people in emergency rooms who were diagnosed with COVID-19 remained low, but that the numbers were likely growing.
Pekosz says that while COVID-19 in 2025 is milder than it was in the early pandemic days, it is “still a severe disease,” and worries that lower vaccination rates will provide less protection for those more susceptible to severe disease – older people, children and those with weaker immune systems.
In Maryland, there had been 1,521,314 reported cases of COVID-19 through last week, according to the most recent data from the Maryland Department of Health. There were at least 18,507 deaths in the same period, the department said.










What’s changed is the political will to utilize vaccines. We have a secretary of Health and Human Services who has clearly not supported vaccines in the past. What you’re seeing with the government recommendations now are exactly that kind of attitude.


– Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who studies respiratory illnesses


Just last week, there were 1,317 active COVID-19 cases in Maryland. But weekly cases have been on a steady rise since mid-summer, when there were just 390 reported COVID-19 cases during the first week of July.
That said, fatalities attributed to COVID-19 are low. There were only three COVID-related deaths last week, according to the state health department. Since July 1, there have been 27 deaths attributed to the virus.
Pekosz said that even though the new guidelines specifically say “high risk” populations should have access to vaccines, limiting its availability to others could still end up lowering protection for the high-risk groups.
“More cases in healthy individuals will spill over into the high-risk groups,” Pekosz says. “More-vulnerable populations do not respond as well to the COVID vaccine. So while the vaccine works, it doesn’t work as well. When you vaccinate the whole population you start to generate these layers of protections.”
Pekosz expects that fewer people will get the vaccine this year due to the confusion.
He and other public health advocates await further guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine this year. Meanwhile, Pekosz recommends that Marylanders prepare for the seasonal rise in cases by picking up some at-home COVID tests. But he still says the COVID vaccine is effective and safe.
“The vaccine is efficacious, I would much rather get the vaccine than get COVID. And that is now being taken off the table for a large number of people,” he said.

I think the average general public would see it as reasonable behavior to have this unnecessary practice stopped.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Barbara Felitti: The issue of hunting over bait piles in Vermont.","This commentary is by Barbara Felitti, of Huntington.


“Blasphemy” and “sacrilegious” is how a Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department biologist described the agency’s proposed rule change to allow hunters to use a rifle or shotgun to kill antlerless deer as a means of controlling the deer population. 
The comments by Nick Fortin were an acknowledgement that, until now, existing hunting rules and cultural norms restricted killing antlerless female deer to the use of bow and arrow or muzzleloader. 
The palpable angst on the part of Fish & Wildlife about the ethics of hunting antlerless deer with rifles is at great odds with their position at a House Environment Committee hearing in February of this year against a bill, H.132, which would prohibit the use of bait as an attractant when hunting furbearing wildlife. Despite repeated questions from legislators, Fish & Wildlife would not offer an opinion about the ethics of baiting which is seen by some hunters as unsportsmanlike for providing an unfair advantage over game.
Another reason for prohibiting hunting over bait piles is public safety. Emotional testimony was presented to the committee from people who lost their dog after it was attracted to and shot over a bait pile. Despite this, the response from Fish & Wildlife’s interim commissioner was that the issue is “nuanced” and the onus to address it should not be put solely on people who use bait piles.
To be clear, Fish & Wildlife acknowledged that they do not know how many furbearers are killed over bait piles every year or how many hunters use bait piles as there are no reporting requirements for the practice. Without this information, there is no meaningful way to assess the legitimacy and ethics of using bait piles as a hunting practice. Fish & Wildlife also failed to answer a question about how important hunting over bait piles is to managing wildlife populations such as coyotes.
Nonetheless, Fish & Wildlife sees it as more important to allow use of an unspecified number of bait piles by an unknown number of hunters rather than address the known safety issue of bait piles causing the death of people’s dogs. Fish & Wildlife expressed no problem with continuing to allow people to shoot from their homes out at a bait pile in the daytime or nighttime. 
Fish & Wildlife staff claim to “try to deal with the issue of safety and what normal people would, average people would, consider reasonable behavior on the part of the hunting community.” I think the average general public would see it as reasonable behavior to have this unnecessary practice stopped.
In 2022, Vermont passed the wanton waste bill, which bans the intentional killing of wildlife without a useful purpose. It resulted in bans on practices such as animal killing contests. It banned this form of hunting not because there was a conservation issue, but because there was a social values issue that indiscriminate killing of wildlife was offensive to the general public.  
Baiting is similarly offensive and unnecessary. At a minimum, Fish & Wildlife could have declined to support the bill or at least not oppose it. Instead, they put their support behind an unknown number of hunters who use bait piles at the expense of safety to the general public and their pets.
Once again, Fish & Wildlife is showing itself to be oblivious to the general public on wildlife issues. 
Back in 1984, the name was changed from the Department of Fish & Game to the Department of Fish & Wildlife. Perhaps it is time to revert back to “Fish & Game” so we are honest about whose interests are being served.

(Photo by edb3_16/Getty Images)A $1.5 billion project to bury a 1-foot-thick and 100-mile-long high voltage power transmission line under the Columbia River turned down fast-tracked federal permitting approval offered by a Trump administration executive order earlier this summer.
Although the Cascade Renewable Transmission System project will move through a slower federal permitting process, it has to wait for permits from Oregon and Washington anyway. But this track may avoid alienating the two blue states.
“We chose to go with the standard process,” said Chris Hocker, the project’s lead and a senior vice president for PowerBridge, the project’s parent company.
“We felt that simply asking for this expedited approval wouldn’t necessarily have any impact on what the states would be doing in terms of their review authority,” he added. “And so we saw very little advantage, and we thought it might undermine the coordinated effort.”
Hocker said PowerBridge also picked the standard federal permitting process because of the complexity of the project, which will bury a transmission line 10 to 15 feet under a giant river between two states, and will require tribal consultation.
A Reuters news analysis last week said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers invoked President Donald Trump’s order declaring a national energy emergency to expedite the project.
But Kerry Solan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Portland District, said in an email that was wrong and added the project had opted out of the “emergency processing procedures.”
Bypassing bottlenecks
The project aims to beef up power transmission infrastructure between where electricity is generated east of the Cascades and where it’s consumed, which is in population centers along the Interstate 5 corridor. It would also move power past transmission bottlenecks in Portland to an important north-south high voltage transmission route and to data centers on the city’s west side, Hocker said.
The project comes at a time when power planners say the region is in desperate need of power and power lines to move it. The region has less available power as clean energy laws in Washington and Oregon increasingly block fossil-fuel-generated electricity. Meanwhile, power demand is expected to potentially double in coming decades because of growing consumption from data centers, as well as home and vehicle electrification.
“More transmission is absolutely needed, whether it’s our project or anybody else’s project,” Hocker said.
Not without a fight
While the Cascade Renewable Transmission project between The Dalles and the Vancouver-Portland area has come at an opportune time, that doesn’t mean it has a clear path to approval.
“Columbia Riverkeeper does have major concerns about this project — specifically, the short-term and long-term environmental impacts of dredging a giant trench through the river and the impacts to aquatic species,” said Teryn Yazdani, a staff attorney for the organization.
Yazdani also fears the project would set a precedent, eventually turning the river — which is already pushed to its limits by power infrastructure — into a utility highway.
The proposed transmission project also stands to harm tribes’ treaty-protected fishing rights and sovereignty, said Julie Carter, a lawyer and longtime policy analyst for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission.
“It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” she said. “They want to dig into critical habitat — habitat that’s needed for … salmon and steelhead, for Pacific lamprey.”
Carter said she worries in particular about lamprey, a species Native nations in the Columbia Basin have worked hard to save. So little is known about lamprey that the project could dig its channel right into the middle of their migration route.
Carter said PowerBridge hasn’t released enough specifics about the project for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission to fully understand its impacts.
“There’s so many questions for us that we’re just scratching our heads,” Carter said.
Permitting march
The Corps echoed that sentiment earlier this year when it said the project’s permitting applications didn’t have enough information.
But Hocker said PowerBridge has since provided the Corps more details and the federal agency has started consulting with regional Native nations about the proposed project.
“It’s really up to the Corps to determine the next steps, but I expect that they will need to delve further into the environmental impacts of the project,” he said.
Solan of the Corps said the agency currently considers the application closed.
“We are working with the applicant to obtain additional information necessary for us to move forward with a thorough review and evaluation,” she said.
On the state permitting front, the project expects to submit siting applications to Washington and Oregon “in the next month or so,” Hocker said.
“It’s been the product of a lot of work and a lot of studies in an attempt to answer the many questions that arise for a project like this, particularly one that has never been considered in the region,” he said.
If all goes well, Hocker said the process will take a couple more years before the project can break ground.

(Photo from the Indiana Historical Society)Everyone loves a parade, as the old adage goes, and in 1886 the Knights of Labor certainly hoped this would prove true when they planned the first Labor Day celebration in Indianapolis. 
With one of the nation’s largest concentrations of union members, the city was ripe to embrace the relatively new tradition of Labor Day parades which had begun four years earlier in New York. But the city’s first attempt at a march that would continue off and on for the next 139 years was less than auspicious.
Originally set for the first Monday in September, the event was moved to September 19 to accommodate the speakers’ schedules. But the turnout was lower than expected due to heavy rainfall, and because the rescheduled date fell on a Sunday, local pastors condemned the event from the pulpit.
The celebration the following year initially looked more promising after Mayor Caleb Denny issued a proclamation asking businesses to close so their employees could watch the parade. But attitudes toward the event turned sour when most of the honorary marshalls turned out to be lawyers and politicians, leaving the actual working men and women to trail behind.
Despite these early bumps in the parade route, the popularity of Labor Day continued to grow, and in 1891 the legislature made Labor Day a state holiday, to be celebrated each year on the first Monday in September. Congress followed suit three years later. With the official recognition of Labor Day as a time for America to recognize the contributions made by its workers, Indiana began planning a day-long celebration that would kick off with a parade and end with an actual bang.

Thousands of spectators lined the streets on September 3, 1894 to watch union members decked out in the uniforms of their trades march from downtown to Lincoln Park at 16th Street and Central. Picnics, speeches and a band concert followed. And then, as dusk fell, everyone flocked to a makeshift arena to watch a performance of the Last Days of Pompeii.
Have we forgotten the true meaning of Labor Day?

Although on its face a play about a volcano that wiped out an entire city would seem to have little to do with a celebration of America’s workers, the performance was nonetheless a hit. Local dancers who had trained at the Statehouse swept across a stage that fronted a manmade lake and a replica of Pompeii with Mount Vesuvius looming in the background. As the performance drew to a close, the volcano belched black smoke and the buildings crumpled in flames, endangering a few spectators who were sitting too close to the stage. 
Then, to the audience’s delight, a dazzling display of fireworks was launched into the night sky, creating a variety of shapes that included an elephant and the American flag. 
In the ensuing years, Labor Day parades continued to grow in popularity as Indianapolis cemented its position as the Labor Capital of America. The city’s central location and easy access by railroad attracted the national headquarters of at least 12 labor unions and was the base of operations for several legendary labor leaders.
In 1922, some 7,500 union workers marched through the streets in what organizers called the largest Labor Day parade ever held in Indianapolis. But the following year, the parade was rained out, and for the next 14 years, Labor Day would come and go without any official celebrations due in part to anti-labor sentiment and the Great Depression.
The parade tradition was briefly revived in the late 1930s, only to be disappear again during WWII when factories needed to remain open. Then in 1949, the Indianapolis News declared that Labor Day parades were a thing of the past, a remnant of the time when workers marched through the streets to call attention to the struggles of labor. 
Indeed. By 1951 the only Labor Day parade in Indy was Sear’s Parade of Values, featuring deep discounts on refrigerators and mattresses.
In 1982, the city’s first Labor Day parade in 40 years filled the streets with marchers from 100 different labor organizations. Seven years later, the parade that initially scorned the inclusion of politicians welcomed Gov. Evan Bayh as its grand marshall. Then in 2012, the parade finally reached the end of its route when it was replaced with the Indianapolis Labor Fest.
But 130 miles north of Indianapolis, the news of the death of the Labor Day parade apparently failed to reach the small town of Lowell. Now in its 106th year, the Lowell event is the longest continuously running Labor Day parade in Indiana.

They designed a self-driving rescue vehicle to help. (Photo provided by Clemson University.A group of Clemson University engineering students watched the nonstop news last September as Helene tore a path of death and destruction through the Carolinas and Tennessee. 
The raging floodwaters that isolated the storm’s victims prompted them to question: What if a team of medics could have driven into mountain towns and far-flung homesteads with a Humvee loaded with supplies? And what if they could have sent the vehicle back on its own to transport injured and rescued passengers?
That was the inspiration behind the latest research project conducted by students in the Upstate university’s Deep Orange program.
A team of 17 students equipped a self-driving vehicle that could be deployed by search and rescue teams.

“This is really important, because in a rescue situation, you obviously want to get to people as quickly as possible. And if you have any injured people, you want to get them out of harm’s way as quickly as possible,” said automotive engineering professor Rob Prucka. “So that’s the kind of work that we’re trying to do.”
Prucka is the director of the Deep Orange program, which has an ongoing, autonomous vehicle research partnership with the U.S. Army.
The project, completed this past spring, marks the 16th iteration of Deep Orange, in which industry leaders give each cohort of students a problem to solve during the course of their studies.
That’s why the vehicle was dubbed Deep Orange 16.
“Deep Orange pushes us to think like real-world engineers,” said team leader Rohit Godse, who graduated in August with a master’s degree in automotive engineering. “We are not just learning theory, but solving complex, high-stakes problems that prepare us to lead in the industry from day one.”
“We’re trying to produce engineers that will be valuable to the auto industry the day they leave Clemson,” Prucka added.
SC lays plans to rebuild or repair an estimated 900 homes damaged by Hurricane Helene

The program also seeks to test technological advancements that automakers or the military may one day use — in this case, a rescue vehicle controlled by software that could be used in combat or stateside during a natural disaster.
One thing Prucka said the team heard over and over from first responders they interviewed is many never know the situation they’re walking into until they get there. They have maybe half the information they need. And it may or may not be correct. So, they need a vehicle that’s ready for anything.
“And maybe the car itself could be an extra helping hand,” Prucka said.
One of the new capabilities the team added to the off-road vehicle included camera systems for looking ahead and sensors for scanning the ground. The vehicle could then use its computing systems to analyze those images and readings on the fly and automatically adjust its suspension accordingly to create a smoother ride.
Those same camera and sensor systems also map the route in, so the vehicle can travel back out without someone controlling it from the driver’s seat.
And in off-road situations, visibility becomes an added challenge.
“If you crest a hill, you can’t usually see over the hill,” Prucka said. “If you’re in a really rocky train, you can’t always tell what exactly a tire is going to run over.”
A 360-degree view from the cameras reduces the number of blind spots operators might have.

Finally, while less high tech, students designed a stretcher-loading mechanism for the back of the vehicle to lift injured passengers.
“On the surface it looks simple in a way,” Prucka said. “But it’s intentional because the soldiers all said this thing needs to work every time. It can’t be complicated. But it does help some challenges that they have actually loading patients into the vehicle, especially, when they’re under distress.”
“Our students are not only driving innovation — they’re helping to save lives by improving how we respond to emergencies in the most challenging environments,” Prucka added.
Deep Orange 16 will remain at Clemson as a prototype.
Future classes will continue to test and improve the technology that could eventually be used in rescue operations.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DO16-Hero-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

Second-grade teacher Demetria Richardson spends so much on school supplies she has a designated credit card to cover classroom expenses. Just don’t tell her husband what the balance is, she said. Usually, the 26-year veteran educator in Richmond, Virginia, spends about $500 on back-to-school items. Over the past month, she has already topped that — and she’s not done shopping.
Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that lets individuals fund public school classroom projects, helps Richardson cover some of the costs on items like dry erase markers, pencils and printer ink. The school supply-stuffed backpacks that local churches distribute to families before the school year also help, Richardson said. Yet, none of this assistance stretches far enough to prevent teachers like her from dipping into their own wallets to serve students.
While covering the cost of classroom supplies is a challenge educators face annually, the burden on them has grown as the price of many learning materials has jumped by 20 percent in roughly five years.
“By the end of September,” Richardson estimated, the total on her credit card for school is “probably going to be close to $1,200.”
President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods — and the supply chain disruptions that resulted — have partly been blamed for driving up the cost of school supplies. His freeze of over $6 billion in education funding on July 1, which he reversed before the end of that month, added to the problem by preventing schools, including Title I schools with large populations of economically disadvantaged students, from stocking classrooms with learning materials well ahead of the academic year.



This story was originally reported by Nadra Nittle of The 19th*.			


“It’s hard to understand that teachers have to buy all these supplies for themselves, for their classrooms and for students,” said Emma García, principal researcher for the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit that conducts research to improve education policy and practice. “I don’t think there’s any other profession in which the professional has to shoulder the supplies or the materials. But for teachers, it’s taken for granted that they will be there, that they are going to do the work no matter what.”
Research indicates that virtually no educators are spared from spending their own money on their classrooms, according to García. Teachers at high-poverty schools told The 19th that, in addition to Trump’s tariffs and funding freeze, other factors have contributed to them paying more for goods. They pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, when they saw prices start to rise and a cultural and economic shift in which students returned to class with few to no supplies, a trend they say persists today.
“This year has definitely been a huge challenge because typically the schools would be able to give us some of the basics, like a stapler, pencils, paper,” said Emmanuela Louis, who teaches English Language Arts for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. School officials “haven’t been able to give us anything, so it’s like we have to rely heavily on DonorsChoose to even get resources for the kids to start the school year. It pretty much puts the most vulnerable kids at risk.”
Through it all, teachers have served as the safety net children can count on when the system breaks down. Educators have taken on debt, found extra work and gone without much-needed personal items to prepare their classrooms — and their students — for another school year.
The personal sacrifices behind classroom supplies
For Richardson, shelling out hundreds of dollars of her own money on school supplies means she won’t be able to buy the $150 pair of stylish Vionic orthopedic shoes that make it easier for her to stand all day.
“People think that we don’t like to look nice, too,” Richardson said. “We want to get a new back-to-school outfit, too, or a pair of shoes. But when it comes to our students, our students come first, and we go on the back burner.”
Louis knows the feeling: Some years she has barely been able to afford back-to-school footwear and apparel herself. During others, she has gone without these items entirely because she had funneled so much money into her classroom at Jose De Diego Middle School in Miami. Although her district provides her with a $300 school supply stipend, a purchase as mundane as copy paper devours those funds instantly, she said.
No more school textbook bills for Indiana parents — but what other fees can still be charged?

“Three hundred dollars doesn’t go far at all,” said Louis, who has taught for 16 years. “When you’re thinking of supplies — folders and things like that — they’re not cheap. You’re buying at least three folders per student just to keep their items organized. Paper is also a necessity to copy things for them. We do have laptops, which kind of helps, but they don’t always go home with them, so they definitely need tangible items in their hands to write and copy things down.”
Altogether, Louis estimates that during any given school year, she spends about $2,500 to $3,000 on her classroom and students. And that doesn’t include the money the mother of two spends on supplies for her own children, a third-grader and a ninth-grader.
Richardson’s classroom expenditures aren’t far behind, as she has spent as much as $2,000 outfitting her classroom at Henry L. Marsh III Elementary in Richmond throughout the school year. That’s well above the average educators spend on supplies, DonorsChoose has found, backing up previous research that revealed teachers at high-needs schools have more out-of-pocket expenses.
“We ran a teacher survey earlier this spring, and we noticed that teachers are spending, on average, $655 of their own money on school supplies for their students and for their classroom,” said Kristina “Steen” Joye Lyles, vice president of equity and impact at DonorsChoose. “That’s an increase from what teachers reported last year, which was $610.”
Without DonorsChoose, Lyles said, teachers reported that they’d be spending over $1,400 of their own money on school supplies annually. “So, this is a trend that we’re watching closely.”
García said paying for school supplies compounds financial pressures for teachers, who earn lower salaries compared with professionals in other careers that require college or graduate degrees. Moreover, teachers often take on student loan debt just to enter the field. Given this, any out-of-pocket costs are “going to be more burdensome for a teacher than for a non-teacher” covering work-related expenses, García contends. And the $300 deduction for classroom expenditures educators can claim on federal income tax returns hardly levels the playing field.
Richardson has felt obligated to subsidize her students’ needs with her own money because she teaches at a Title I school where nearly every pupil qualifies for free or reduced lunch. Some years, most of her classroom expenses have gone toward snacks for students.
“Some parents send their own snacks, but we do have a lot of kids whose parents don’t, so we hate to see them sitting there needing that extra boost of energy but not having it,” she said. “You’re talking about snacks for maybe 20 kids, five times a week. That does add up.”
Also adding up is the rising cost of school supplies. This year, Richardson has paid more for crayons, glue sticks, composition books, folders and other materials than she remembers paying in recent years.
“I used to get folders for 50 cents apiece,” she said. “Now they’re almost 95 cents a folder. We used to be able to get boxes of crayons, but we can’t get them in bulk at the dollar store anymore. They said supply is low. Now, they’re like almost $2 for a 16-count box.”
Louis can no longer afford to give each of her 125 students a small box of crayons, along with a kit filled with rulers, index cards and highlighters. This year, she said, groups of four students will have to share these school supply kits. Sharing them means that her students can’t take the kits home to complete their schoolwork.

Since her students are required to wear uniforms consisting of polo shirts and navy or khaki pants, Louis has also spent her own money to make sure her sixth graders, many of whom come from migrant families who can’t afford more than one uniform, have multiple sets of these clothing items.
“The uniforms have gone up tremendously,” she said. “It used to cost $6 or $7 for a shirt. Now they’re between $9 to $12.”
As classes resumed in Richmond, Richardson had already spent $200 on composition books and $400 on durable headphones for her students that wouldn’t break like the cheap ones she had in her classroom last school year. New whiteboards and dry erase markers were also on her list.
A mother of four — the youngest of which is a college senior in need of her own supplies — Richardson said she’s fortunate enough to have children who pitch in to help her obtain learning materials.
“They always say, ‘Hey, Mom, I picked up some crayons for you,’ or ‘Mom, I picked up some pencils. Mom, you always said the kids never have scissors,’” Richardon said. “I’m so blessed that they do look out for me.”
The empty backpack: a post COVID reality
Reflecting on the start of her teaching career, which coincided with the turn of the 21st century, Richardson noticed a stark difference compared with today in how parents respond to the annual supply list her school sends out.
“Earlier in my career, parents would send everything on the school supply list, and then they would send extras just in case,” she said. “If your tissue box supply ran low, you could reach out and they would replenish it.”
Today, however, students will get free bookbags from community events and bring nothing more than the bag and the supplies in it — usually one notebook, one pack of paper, one box of crayons — to school with them, Richardson said.
“If we’re lucky, that’s what they have,” she said.
Out of 125 students, Louis said that she expects “maybe not even 20 percent” to show up to school with the supplies they need. That’s about 25 students.
The COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point, ushering in mass job losses and supply chain disruptions that made it difficult for families to pay for essentials like rent and food, let alone school supplies. When students returned to class after remote learning, many stopped bringing the items on supply lists, teachers told The 19th.
“So we tried to minimize what was on the list to be just the necessities,” Richardson said.
At her high-poverty school, most students show up with half the supplies on the back-to-school list, while about a quarter arrive completely empty-handed, she said. Some parents question why students need items like resealable plastic baggies, dry-erase markers or hand sanitizer, so they don’t purchase them. Others just haven’t been able to find items on the supply list, like the clear or mesh book bags required since July 2024 by Richmond Public Schools.
To supplement her income and easily provide her students with the appropriate learning materials, Richardson has in the past taken on extra work — teaching summer school and working as a tutor and facilitator. Doing so, she said, gave her “extra money all year round to offset what I spend in my classroom.” A DonorsChoose survey revealed that nearly half of teachers report having a second job.

“So, again, we’re just seeing this heightened level of teachers going above and beyond to be able to stay afloat during a time when things are getting really expensive,” Lyles said.
Jodi Hanauer, an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) teacher at Juniata Park Academy in Philadelphia, has previously picked up more work, which, in part, helped her buy school supplies.
“I took on a part-time job just to pay the bills for several years,” the 22-year educator said. “I was an online ESOL teacher at night and during the weekends. I was teaching kids and adults English in countries like China, Japan and [places like] Hong Kong.”
The extra income she earned then marked the rare time buying school supplies, for which Hanauer pays between $500 to $1,000 annually, didn’t hurt financially. Like Louis, her school district provides her with a small stipend to cover learning materials, but the $200 doesn’t begin to compensate for the expenditures she makes working at a high-poverty school.
Title I funds from the federal government help schools with economically disadvantaged students to cover supply costs.  But Trump’s funding freeze in July held up Title I funding, delaying schools from getting their supply orders processed well before the new academic year.
“We haven’t been able to receive the order for this school year yet, so we’re hoping that will get cleared up soon,” Richardson said.
A stopgap, not a solution
DonorsChoose helps teachers like Richardson avoid financial collapse.
She’s currently seeking donations for basic school supplies like pencils and ink for the classroom printer. She’d also like clay to help her students do classroom projects that develop their fine motor skills.
But DonorsChoose, Richardson said, is not a permanent solution to the long-standing pattern of teachers covering school supplies.
“It takes a while for the projects to be funded and then the materials to be shipped to us,” she said. “If we need poster boards for our students to do a history project, and we need them in the classroom on Friday, I have to go out and purchase 18 poster boards to make sure that all of my students have one.”
For Hanauer, DonorsChoose is no guarantee she will get all the school supplies she needs. She currently has a campaign to give prizes — which have previously included fidget spinners and high-end pens, pencils and erasers — to students who make positive behavioral choices.
“Putting up a DonorsChoose project is like a dream,” she said. “You are dreaming of getting things, and it’s great if that happens, but if you absolutely need something now or in one week, then you’re going to have to come up with the money yourself.”
For 12 years, Louis has used DonorsChoose to subsidize her classroom expenses. Since many of her students are English learners, it’s imperative that her classroom be a print-rich environment. But educational posters can cost $35 apiece, an expense that can quickly balloon. Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose has helped her cut down on these costs. She’s also used the site to fund field trips. She’s currently crowdfunding for a file cabinet and poster machine ink that can cost up to $500.
Although teachers make countless sacrifices to kick off the school year and maintain their classrooms as the months unfold, Louis knows that the public is largely unaware of how much educators personally contribute to school supply lists. Every item in a classroom, she said, has been designed with one goal in mind: facilitating student learning.
“So, please be gentle with teachers,” she asked, urging families to provide any learning materials they’re capable of buying. Teachers who pour money into their classrooms, she said,  do so “out of the kindness of our heart, because we really enjoy what we do.”

(Getty Images)When organic wheat farmer Joel Huesby was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s in southeast Washington, many teens sought jobs in the region’s vegetable canneries. He, his wife, his sister-in-law and many friends all worked in a cannery and then each June joined other teens around Walla Walla picking strawberries. 
“It was kind of like a rite of passage,” said Huesby. But while he enjoys reminiscing, he also acknowledges that it would be impractical for today’s farmers to depend on teens and other amateurs to pick their crops.
It was nearly as impractical back in the 1960s when Congress canceled the guest worker program to make room for more American workers in agriculture. The temporary worker program was established during World War I as a solution to labor shortages. The program closed in 1922 but was brought back in 1942, with a focus on Mexican farmworkers spending part of the year in the United States. 
It continued to evolve until 1964, when foreign workers made up nearly half the American farm workforce. At that time, Congress shuttered the program and encouraged American youth to be patriotic and work in the fields. And those American teens were about as enthusiastic for agricultural work as the farmers were about hiring them.
“That’s not today’s agriculture,” says Huesby. “You need the people to come onto the big farms … and basically follow the seasons north. That’s a completely different world.”
American agriculture has changed a lot since the mid-20th century. And the challenges farmers face today are different as well. The list is long. In addition to ongoing labor issues, there are stagnant commodity prices, rising equipment and transportation costs, tariffs, unevenly distributed government subsidies and federal programs that stop and start government distribution of surplus crops.
People following politics closely may be focused on the ways Trump administration policies on immigration and tariffs are making life more difficult for farmers. But Washington growers say the main challenges they face go back a lot further than the 2024 election.
‘Our growers are running out of time’
Huesby, who identifies as conservative politically, says American farmers can’t succeed without guest workers and immigrants. He says Americans who grew up in this country are not raised for agricultural jobs. 
“They don’t have the work ethic. They’re soft. They don’t have the muscle memory,” he said. Huesby doesn’t hire seasonal workers for his small organic wheat farm, but his neighbors do and they talk. 
They worry about what might happen to the current guest worker program and whether farmworkers from Mexico and Central America will continue to come to the United States for seasonal work if they think they could be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a church or the grocery store, even though they are in this country legally.
Washington fruit growers lived with those fears this summer when, thanks to great weather, they saw one of the best cherry crops they’ve had in years. 
Mark Powers, president of the Northwest Horticultural Council, said the organization, which works with tree fruit growers, is concerned about the news coming out of the other Washington. But the industry’s No. 1 issue is labor and as it has been for years, he said.
While trade and tariffs both get more attention from the public, labor and regulatory issues have been haunting cherry, apple and pear growers for more than a decade.
“Growers focus on growing excellent fruit. That’s their day job. But increasingly, growers have to wear a lot of different hats,” Powers said. 
Those include regulatory compliance, managing guest workers, OSHA and food safety. Escalation in wages and compliance issues at both the federal and state levels apply most of the pressure. Remember those old movies and books that make farming seem like an easygoing, idyllic life? I’m not sure if it ever was, but Powers assures me it certainly isn’t today. 
“Every year, the anxiety, the concerns, and now in some cases fear, ratchets up,” Powers said. He adds: There’s no sign on the horizon that rising costs will level off.
He notes that Washington farmworker wages have gone up at least 48% since 2017, but a glance at state income statistics shows that is true for all wages in the state, not just farm wages. While this is a challenge for all employers, most have increased their prices to keep up with rising costs. But Powers and others maintain that isn’t as simple with food and commodity prices. 
Apple prices, for example, have not increased 48% since 2017. The Federal Research Bank of St. Louis tracks consumer and commodity prices, and they report that apple prices have risen about 20% during that same time period, with some ups and downs depending on apple varieties and other circumstances like the weather. Just for comparison, the cost to rent an apartment in Seattle went up more than 90% during the past decade. 
“People can manage around that to a certain degree for a limited amount of time. Our growers are running out of time,” Powers said. 
Domestic labor shortages are adding complexity and cost. More fruit growers are now depending on the H-2A visa program, also known as the guest worker program, for seasonal farmworkers. 
Between 2017 and 2024, the number of H-2A workers brought into Washington state increased from approximately 18,800 workers to roughly 36,000. That increases farm labor costs – because farmers have to provide housing and transportation for these guest workers – and total labor expenses are getting out of reach for small family farms, Powers said. 
The program may also be making it harder for farmers to attract local workers since they do not have to provide housing for non-migrant labor and there’s a higher hourly wage required for H-2A workers – $19.82, versus the state minimum wage of $16.66. These disparities are also leading to dissatisfaction among the local workers, according to farm labor advocates.
‘If it had been up to the Northwest, we would have had a solution’
The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides money to farmers to keep them in business despite price and expense fluctuations, but the system is considered imperfect by some and unfair by others. 
Huesby, the wheat farmer, is not a big fan of farm subsidies. He calls them “subsidized crop insurance,” and notes that 10% of farms get 80% of the subsidies. Part of the reason for the disparity is how complex the government programs are. Only farms that afford someone to do all the extra paperwork can get their hands on this money, he says, noting, “I’m a farmer of the soil. I’m not a farmer of computer programs.”
It doesn’t matter your politics, Huesby says. Both conservative and liberal farmers have something to say about U.S. agriculture subsidies, which most lawmakers are reluctant to cut or reform because farm lobbies in Washington, D.C., are so strong. Huesby, who is not shy about expressing his political views, says this is one of the reasons he thinks congressmen should not turn public service into a lifetime career. 
Powers believes both immigration reform and agriculture policy reform could provide some relief. He says both state leaders and central Washington’s representative in Congress, Rep. Dan Newhouse, are working toward solutions.
“If it had been up to the Northwest, we would have had a solution,” Powers said, noting this is a big country with diverse opinions on both topics and that’s one reason why these reforms are taking so long.
Newhouse has proposed several bills to protect American farms and is working with a bipartisan coalition on a proposal to modernize the guest worker program, to provide a steady immigrant workforce for American farms. Washington state lawmakers have been working with agriculture industry leaders to find a way to pay farmworkers a good wage while keeping farmers in business and their crops harvested.
A coalition of farmers and farmworkers are also working together on these challenges. Save Family Farming, based in Everson, Washington, reported earlier this summer during the cherry harvest that the federal immigration crackdown was leaving some farms without the labor they needed to harvest their fruit. 
While local workers were worried about being targeted by ICE agents, some migrant workers were also staying away, said Erik Zavala, director of field staff at Wenatchee-based Blue Bird, Inc., a cooperative of small family farms. They heard on social media that farmworkers were warning the migrants to avoid Washington because ICE was conducting raids at orchards. 
No actual raids were reported by Washington farmers, but the fear was enough to keep workers away.
Fear is a major factor in many of the threats affecting Pacific Northwest agriculture. For example, Washington fruit growers export 25-30% of their crop and the threat of rising tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s trade wars have added to farmers’ uncertainty. Tariffs may eventually affect equipment costs and parts to repair equipment – one more thing to worry about.
Growers have started to leave the industry, Powers said.
According to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service’s Census of Agriculture, Washington tree farms actively producing a crop decreased by 15 percent between 2017 and 2022. But Powers said that number has gone down since then. The USDA reports the number of Oregon apple farms decreased by 26.6 percent, pear farms by 27 percent, and sweet cherry farms by 28.9 percent between 2017 and 2022.

Texts, emails and audio obtained via public records requests provide further insight into the conflict between Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and Glover’s select board.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How a dirt road became a small-town spectacle involving Vermont’s lieutenant governor.","GLOVER — To an outsider, Rodgers Road seems like one of hundreds of unremarkable dirt roads in Vermont. The road, which stretches for over a mile, is surrounded by towering green trees and sprawling farmland. It passes by a cemetery holding the gravestones of families that have called this small Northeast Kingdom town home for generations.But the road is also at the center of an increasingly personal, yearslong ownership dispute between Vermont’s Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and the town of Glover’s leadership and employees. The town considers all of Rodgers Road to be a town highway — Town Highway 48, specifically. Meanwhile, Rodgers says a three-quarter mile portion along which he lives and farms is actually private and belongs to him. 
Rodgers Road — named after the lieutenant governor’s family, who have owned the property for close to two centuries — makes an almost 90 degree turn, creating a wonky square with the equally rural Andersonville Road and Daniels Pond Road. Both of those roads are Class 3, meaning that under Vermont law they must be maintained year-round. That classification continues past the intersection onto Rodgers Road for roughly one-third of a mile. The remainder of Rodgers Road is considered Class 4, which doesn’t require year-round maintenance. This is the contentious section, currently the subject of a lawsuit that Rodgers filed against the town last month.  
Rodgers says his family has always owned the road section. Glover, on the other hand, says the town has always owned the section. The legal dispute started in 2023. 
That was about a year before Rodgers announced his decision to run for the state’s second highest office and 18 months since he had last represented the region in the state Legislature. Elected in 2002 as a state representative for Glover and surrounding towns, Rodgers later also served as a state senator, in both offices as a Democrat. He changed parties before accepting the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in 2024. 
On June 12, 2023, according to public records obtained by VTDigger, Rodgers emailed then-Glover Selectboard member Leanne Harple — now herself serving as the town’s state representative — requesting that no work be done on the Class 4 section of Rodgers Road, until the question of ownership is answered. 
Earlier that day, Rodgers had stopped Mike Pray, a member of the Glover road crew, from putting in a new culvert on that section of the road. 
“I would ask that until this legal issue has been resolved that No town action is taken on the class for [sic] section of the road,” Rodgers wrote in the email, obtained via the public records request.
Rodgers went on to say he was considering closing the road to through traffic once his right to do so was affirmed. “I could close the road and make the town higher [sic] a legal team to find evidence of their right of way if I decided to go that direction,” he wrote. “I would rather not.”
“My intention is that if my legal team is correct that I will eventually close the road to car and truck traffic but would leave it open to all pedestrian bicycle ATV in UTV used as a Trail,” Rodgers added.When Harple forwarded Rodgers’ email to Pray and other Glover officials — asking if work could pause until the legal issue had been resolved — Pray shared his version of events.“I was greeted with John [Rodgers] walking up to me in the excavator calling me a moron, and was told if I do any work on the Class 4 … that cops would be called,” Pray wrote. 
Later in the email thread, then-selectboard member David Simmons said he didn’t see a reason to give up the road. 
“Calling Mike a Fucking moron is nothing more than him being a bully,” he wrote.
The disagreement was just starting to heat up.

Town records and road crew
A few weeks later, on July 17, 2023, Rodgers found himself in front of the Glover Selectboard, arguing his case.
“I asked the town about giving [Rodger’s Road] up, they didn’t seem like they were going to negotiate,” Rodgers said at the meeting, according to audio obtained by VTDigger. “So I got a hold of a lawyer and a researcher. And from our preliminary research, there is no record of layout, no record of dedication and acceptance, two major hurdles for the town.”
In response, Nick Ecker-Racz, a former selectboard member who gained extensive knowledge about Glover roads and their history helping put together various maps for town use, disagreed, stating Rodgers’ researcher was “mistaken.” 
After some polite chatter, Rodgers brought up the conflict that had occurred between himself and Pray on June 12. Rodgers also accused Scott Pray, another member of the Glover road crew, of “coming at” him with a grader, and stated the town had made a “huge mistake” hiring the Prays to the road crew. 
The meeting then devolved into an argument between Rodgers and the road crew. 

Following the meeting, Glover Selectboard members sent Rodgers a letter stating: “Last night’s Select Board meeting was uncomfortable and upsetting … Somehow, we need to find a way to de-escalate the tension that exists now between you and our town employees.”A key theme in the Rodgers Road dispute has been the strained relationship between Rodgers and Glover’s road crew, particularly  Scott and Mike Pray — who are father and son, respectively. Their clashes often got personal. 
Rodgers and his wife, Brenda Rodgers, both accused Glover road crew members of trying to run them off of the road multiple times according to letters written by the couple to the Glover selectboard. The letters were written following a request by Harple, who asked the couple via email on July 18 to write down their experiences with the road crew.Brenda’s letter recounted a time she was driving home from work on July 13, 2023, and “had to almost come to a complete stop as the grader came slightly over the middle of the road onto my side,” she wrote. “I was sure he was going to hit me. I was scared for my life and hope nothing like that ever happens again. I feel unsafe driving these town roads.”John’s letter accused the Prays of trying to run him off the road on the same day. Rodgers also accused Scott Pray of attempting to run him off the road in spring 2023 while the latter was doing maintenance on Parker Road.“I came around the sharp corner and met Scott on the grader,” John Rodgers wrote. “At first he made a quick steer to the right to give the approaching vehicle more room but when he saw that it was me he made a quick steer back toward me and continue[d] to crowd me off the road.”
Mike and Scott Pray responded with their own letters, denying the Rodgers’ accusations.“I have no recollection of ever swerving at anyone ever while operating the grader,” Scott Pray wrote. “As far as Brenda’s accusation I truly do not know what she drives or what she looks like.” 
Mike Pray wrote that he had “no recollection of myself, or any town employees swerving, veering or trying to run John Rodgers, Brenda Rodgers or anyone else [off the road] while maintaining and performing our duties, or for any other reason in the Town of Glover.”
On Dec. 5, 2023, after the road crew had plowed his road later than he expected following a snow storm, Rodgers wrote about the escalating frustration he felt with the road crew in an email to selectboard members Harple and Phil Young.“My family has nearly 200 years of service to this town and a reputation for being honest, hard-working people that help everybody out,” he wrote. “I have over 20 years of public service serving this town and this area. To have these lowlifes discriminating against me, is a serious slap in the face.”

A complex controversy
Between January 2024 and April 2025, the road dispute cooled off from its prior fever pitch. During that time, Rodgers ran for lieutenant governor and won the race against a seated incumbent, a rarity in Vermont politics. He was formally sworn into that office in January 2025 after a vote by the full Legislature, required because neither candidate had won a majority in the fall race. 
But a number of actions in the spring — including a select board meeting and stories run by WCAX, one of Vermont’s local television news stations — brought the issue to the attention of Vermonters, some of them just getting to know their new lieutenant governor.
At a May 8 select board meeting, Rodgers, who joined via Zoom, again threatened legal action against the town and said he would shut the road to through traffic, according to reporting by WCAX.
“The reason I would like to be able to negotiate something that the town could support is because if we don’t, then we’re both gonna spend a ton more money on lawyers,” Rodgers said at that meeting according to audio obtained by VTDigger. “If I win, I’m going to shut the road down completely. There’ll be no access. If you win, you’re going to spend a whole bunch of money on lawyers and then have to spend money fixing up the road and maintaining it forever.”

At least one select board member sympathized with the lieutenant governor’s position. 
In a Facebook comment on the WCAX story, select board member Anne Eldridge defended Rodgers against others commenters who accused him of taking advantage of his statewide office to make a land grab against the town.“Regardless of my position, I’m still just one voter and citizen in this town. I consider John a friend, and am absolutely sympathetic to his, and his family’s, concerns,” Eldridge wrote. 
The television segment “indeed showed a very limited view of a complex and long-standing controversy,” she said in the social media post. “I don’t personally agree with the comments saying this is any kind of abuse of power – he has every right to make his case as a resident, and we have an obligation to hear out and address the concerns of our constituents.”At the May 8 meeting, select board members discussed getting input from others living on Rodgers Road. In response, some Glover residents began organizing a petition to keep all of Rodgers Road a town highway.Twelve Glover residents, most of whom live or own property on or near the road, signed the petition. Two notable names on the list were Jim and Nancy Rodgers — John Rodgers’ uncle and aunt, who lived in Rodgers’ current home for decades until they sold it to him in 2019. The couple still live on the road, in a home nearby. Prior to the sale, Rodgers lived on a road next to Rodgers Road.In a May 19 letter to the Glover Select Board, resident Elizabeth Nelson argued that if the Class 4 section of the road “ceases to be a public through highway, it will make access for agricultural or residential use impossible to my property. It will also significantly affect my property value.”Nella and James Coe, two longtime Glover residents who run an architecture firm and whose property touches Rodgers Road, were lead circulators of the petition.“Currently, a corner of our property adjoins Rodgers Road. If it was all privatized, we’d lose access,” James Coe told VTDigger.

The petition was presented at a May 22 select board meeting, attended by over 40 people.
Jim Rodgers, John Rodgers’ uncle, came to the meeting to voice his opposition at the idea of his nephew owning the road.“We’re against it. We’re living on a Class 4 road, and we would be land-locked if that was shut off,” Jim Rodgers said. “To put it bluntly, it’s silly. It’s plain stupid. That’s my opinion.”At the meeting, the select board unanimously voted to officially keep all of Rodgers Road part of Town Highway 48, allowing the road crew to continue to work on and maintain the road.“Now, the war begins,” one select board member said moments after the vote.
On June 4, select board member Glenn Gage emailed Mike Pray, alleging that when Gage went to visit Rodgers Road to check on the work the road crew did, the lieutenant governor was “confrontational about what was going on, mainly about WCAX being involved. He says it was an inside job that got this story leaked. I assured him that it was not, but he has made his mind up over that part.”On June 11, John and Brenda Rodgers filed suit against the town, requesting a preliminary injunction to prevent Glover from performing planned work on the disputed section of Rodgers Road. They also asked the court to determine who owns the Class 4 section of the road. A hearing for the case is scheduled for October.
To bolster the lawsuit, the lieutenant governor hired a surveyor, who in an affidavit stated that there has never been a record that establishes the town’s ownership of the disputed section of Rodgers Road.Ecker-Racz, the former select board member, disputed that conclusion, providing VTDigger with a 19th-century document that he says shows maintenance work was done on the road by a town road worker before it was owned by the Rodgers family. 
James Ehlers, Rodgers’ chief of staff, declined to comment on the Rodgers Road dispute because the matter was making its way through the court, and referred all questions to the lieutenant governor’s legal representation.“We assert that the Town never lawfully established the disputed section of Rodgers Road as a legal town highway,” Michael Tarrant, one of Rodgers’ lawyers told VTDigger this week. “We believe that a segment that runs through their property has always been and remains their private property.”Tarrant also rebuked the idea of Rodgers shuttering the road to public access.“If we prevail in this case, the result would not be that the Rodgers will have ‘taken back’ or ‘privatized’ this disputed segment,” Tarrant wrote. “Rather, the Court would confirm that this portion of the road never belonged to the Town to begin with — and public access has and will remain within the discretion of the Rodgers.”
The Coes, who are co-chairs of the Glover Planning Commission, said the lawsuit has put a strain on town resources.“We are on the planning commission, and we have had to stop pursuing some projects because this is happening,” Nella said. “Anything that is raised, that we’d like to do, we are being told … there is no money and it’s not an option to even ask for it, because that would just cause stress to the town.”Despite the friction the road dispute has caused between Rodgers and town officials, Nella said it has also had a surprisingly positive effect on Glover residents.“Its kind of brought people together. It’s been cool in that way,” she said. “… I’m sorry to say this, but they’re kind of laughing about it.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. On this Labor Day, as the Trump administration systematically attacks workers and undercuts labor rights, it is not enough for the labor movement to oppose what is happening. 
While resistance is essential, we must also chart a path forward — one that clearly articulates what we stand for and the future we are building. A future where all workers — working people of all identities, backgrounds, education, ability, size, expression and status — feel safety, security and solidarity from their union and labor movement.
Local union members recently created an agenda called “Our Shared Vision for Workers’ Rights and Economic Justice” that is the result of listening to workers who understand firsthand what working people need to thrive. 
Working people are clear on what a just economy looks like. With this agenda, we have concrete steps to achieve it. Our shared vision rejects the false choice between economic growth and worker rights, recognizing that strong workers and strong communities are the foundation of a strong economy.
The vision addresses urgent realities facing workers today. Despite increased productivity year after year, working people are not sharing in the fruits of their labor. Workers across essential services burn out at unprecedented rates due to understaffing. These are symptoms of an economic system that prioritizes short-term profits over human dignity.
We call on employers to support workers and labor rights
Our agenda calls on employers to take concrete action to support their employees. Even as the federal administration takes extreme steps to strip workers of their labor rights, employers have the ability and the obligation to respect workers’ right to organize without interference and to bargain in good faith. We are demanding employers honor workers’ right to respect picket lines without disciplinary action. When labor laws are stacked against workers, striking workers need to be able to access their collective power.
We are demanding safe staffing ratios in essential institutions so workers do not have to choose between providing quality services and their own well-being. We are calling for workplaces free from immigration enforcement intimidation. We call on employers to provide workers with accessible comprehensive health care including gender-affirming care, expanded diversity and equity initiatives, and robust protection of organizing rights.
But we are not just asking — we are acting. The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO is committed to mobilizing the labor movement to support efforts to bargain these provisions into union contracts.
Government policies should support economic justice
We are calling for a minimum wage that is actually a living wage — one that allows working people to support their families.
America’s crumbling infrastructure represents both crisis and opportunity, creating good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced while building reliable systems communities depend on. Our country needs massive investment in job-creating infrastructure programs that hire local union workers. 
We need reasonable caps limiting CEO pay to sensible multiples of median worker wages. When CEOs earn hundreds of times more than their workers, it reflects priorities that value shareholder profits over people who actually do the work and create value.
Our vision includes guaranteeing universal paid time off, providing unemployment insurance for striking workers, requiring prevailing wage and labor peace agreements on publicly-funded projects, transitioning to a single-payer health care system, fully funding public education and protecting due process in immigration.
At a time when many people feel disconnected from politics, public leaders seeking labor’s support must demonstrate commitment to this comprehensive vision for economic and racial justice for all working people. 
This vision represents more than policy proposals — it is a framework for building a society that values the humanity, dignity and contributions of all working people. While the current administration is attacking the foundations of worker rights, we refuse to only play defense. In this critical moment, we are stepping forward with a comprehensive vision that benefits not just union members, but all working families.
We can create communities where families thrive and feel safe, where workers have power and voice, and where prosperity is shared by all who contribute to our collective success. 
This Labor Day, as we celebrate the contributions and dignity of working people, we offer more than recognition — we offer a path forward. This is our shared vision, this is our call to action, and this is our Labor Day commitment to building the future that we all deserve.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1127927-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 28, 2025.
It started with a pair of ripped ski pants.
During the pandemic, Kate Harvey and her family were living in Connecticut but, like many southern New Englanders, looked north to get outdoors during the isolation. She was skiing with her son in southern Vermont when her pants ripped on the lift. They were beyond mending, but she followed her son’s youthful interest in taking things apart to see how they work. After dissembling the pants, she used the parts to make small pouches.
“It was just little zip pouches that Teddy would put his money in, and he would bring them to school, and so then his buddies would be like, ‘Oh, those are so cool.’ And then their moms would ask about them,” Harvey said.
Fast forward a few years and Harvey’s budding BirdieBlue business is partnering with apparel makers like Burton in Burlington and Turtle Fur — located nearby in Morrisville — and others to turn worn out ski jackets and snow pants into boutique fanny packs and tote bags.
It was clear to Harvey that Vermont would be an ideal place to run such a business, with its proximity to skiing-adjacent and outdoors-focused business communities, and to the material she sought to repurpose. Her husband’s flexible job as head of sales for a medical technology company allowed the family to relocate.
“We decided it’s our happy place. It’s where we wanted to be,” Harvey said. “We were a little bit of the Covid cliche, I guess, but we found that this was just an incredibly supportive community. I almost think that if I hadn’t started this fully in Vermont, there’s no way this would have been successful.”

From a workshop crowded with bags of used cold-weather clothing in an industrial area on Old Creamery Road — along the Morrisville bypass — Harvey and assistant Allegra Sargent wash loads of worn-out jackets and pants before cutting them apart and reassembling them into fanny packs, tote bags and toiletry bags. These bags are sold directly to consumers through the BirdieBlue online retail shop, but they’ve also been proliferating in local retailers in Morrisville and Stowe, and even in places like REI stores in Williston and New Hampshire.
Harvey partnered with designers to first produce the fanny pack ($58), which was the shop’s flagship product, before moving onto the toiletry bag ($58) and totes ($110).
The fanny pack comes in three-panel colorways, and over time Harvey has gauged the popularity of certain color combinations.
Harvey started the business with the pitch that 92 million tons of textile waste is produced globally, and she presumed there would be a market for people who wanted to dispose of their clothing as ethically as possible.
“We started really with thinking, let’s create a program where just any skier — an individual mom who’s got a kid at an outdoor preschool that has totally unusable gear at the end of the season — we can just create a program where you can send us your gear for free, and then you get a discount code, or we can make something out of it for you,” Harvey said.
BirdieBlue will be relaunching the program soon in anticipation of a busy holiday season. The program was also how Harvey got connected with Burton.
“They kind of heard what I was doing, and they were a great case study in the fact that gear companies were looking for something to do with all this gear that was going in the garbage,” Harvey said. “We’re providing an opportunity to be a collaborator, not a competitor, where we’ll take the gear, we’ll create something.”
This has led to an expanded retail presence, but also partnerships with ski patrols at places like Stowe Mountain Resort and Bolton Valley Resort. Earlier this week, Sargent, who has a degree in production design with an emphasis in costuming and lives in Morrisville, was busy slicing up a Stratton Mountain Resort jacket set to be refashioned.

This two-women operation is how most of the work gets done. Harvey travels to events in Vermont and beyond to spread the gospel of her upcycled accessories, which are assembled by hand. In July, she received a $25,000 grant from a nonprofit funding women whose businesses address sustainability and the environment. She invested it in a used cutting machine to make the process more efficient.
BirdieBlue went from making a couple bags a week to hundreds of bags a month, scaling with the help of a domestic network of sewing factories. But like many U.S.-based manufacturers who do most of their manufacturing and source most of their materials in the country, it hasn’t been possible to insulate the business entirely from the vagaries of the global economy and the Trump administration’s tariffs, even while limiting the parts she sources from Asian countries.
“U.S. producers are like, ‘Well, wait a minute. China’s now charging this much more. We can match that now,’” Harvey said. “This whole idea of tariffs injecting money into the U.S. economy is total bulls**t, to be honest. Where we need more investment is grants and workforce development and education.”
At the end of the day, Harvey said her path to growth has been not just about how she makes her clothes, but how she tells the story of how and why she makes them that way.
“One thing that I’ve really realized is building the community drives the sales, because it is really about the story,” Harvey said. “I mean, we’re not mass producing. It truly takes time, like a lever is cutting every single jacket by hand, so I think once we get in front of people and they really understand what we’re doing, they buy into the story.”

The new law, which went into effect last week, eliminates what’s commonly known as the “luxury” state sales tax rate of 4.225% on these products and reduces it to 1.225%, the same rate at which necessities such as groceries are taxed. 
After years of bipartisan support for eliminating this luxury tax in Missouri, the new law finally got across the finish line in May as part of a larger bill that repealed the state’s capital gains tax. 
Incontinence products for babies, children and adults are included in the exemption, as are products used during menstruation, including period “cups” and period underwear.
Heading into the 2025 legislative session, Missouri was one of about two dozen states with the inflated tax on diapers still in place and one of 19 states with a luxury tax on period products. This year it joined Alabama in eliminating both.
“Imagine the need for sanitary products being called a luxury,” state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, said during a House committee hearing this spring. “Any of us who has experienced such a luxury once a month would argue strongly against that being the case.” 
Advocates for the elimination of this tax on diapers and period products often cite the exclusion of products such as Viagra, which treats erectile dysfunction, from the luxury tax.
Trish Vincent, director of the Missouri Department of Revenue, said in a statement that the change “provides meaningful relief for Missouri families.”

This year, Missouri had the greatest number of state legislators working to eliminate the diaper tax, with 17 pieces of legislation proposed, according to the National Diaper Bank Network’s legislation tracker. 
In 2024, nearly half of U.S. families with children younger than 4 who were wearing diapers reported experiencing diaper insecurity, according to a study published in May by the National Diaper Bank Network and the marketing research group YouGov. 
Of those experiencing diaper insecurity, 79% of mothers surveyed said they felt stressed or anxious about potentially being unable to afford diapers, which also contributed to feelings of loneliness and fears about the future.
The St. Louis Area Diaper Bank called the new law a “monumental win for families across Missouri.”
An estimated one in four parents experiencing diaper insecurity reported missing an average of five days of school or work a month because they didn’t have enough diapers and therefore couldn’t drop their child off at day care, where parents are typically required to provide their own diapers, according to the network.
Lack of access to period products also contributes to missed school and work for countless American girls and women every year. The Alliance for Period Supplies estimates two in five people struggle to afford period supplies. 
State Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat and a proponent of eliminating the diaper and period product taxes, also filed legislation aimed at requiring public schools to provide free period products to students beginning in fourth grade.

Adaptive bikes are typically custom built with a range of different components and configurations. They can cost up to $25,000, which is where organizations like Green Mountain Adaptive Sports and the Kelly Brush Foundation come in.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Aug. 28, 2025.
Carol Weaver has been riding a specialized mountain bike for most of her life.
She was born with cerebral palsy, a condition that affected all four of her limbs. A few years ago, she suffered a riding accident that left her paralyzed from the chest down.
Most riders would have abandoned the sport at that point, but Weaver doubled down in order to combat creeping feelings of depression. Today she lives near a network of accessible trails in Maine and rides two to three times a week, but it was sometimes difficult for her to find a cycling community and trails that suited her needs.
A few years ago, Weaver began traveling to Stowe for an annual group ride in Cady Hill Forest, a destination for adaptive-ready terrain. This year’s ride, organized in partnership with Green Mountain Adaptive Sports, was held last weekend and featured 24 athletes from all over New England.
“These events are a big deal,” Weaver said. “Getting out on the trail and letting the public see us out there sends an important message that people with disabilities can live active, full lives. It’s good for our mental health. It’s also a good way to see how different riders tackle the trail.”

On Saturday, August 23, a handful of two-wheeled guides led adaptive riders through Cady Hill, and on Sunday, several of them competed in the Race To The Top of Vermont, a foot and cycling race to the top of Mount Mansfield. Weaver took first among the adaptive riders, an annual goal of hers.
Adaptive bikes are typically custom built with a range of different components and configurations. They can cost up to $25,000, but organizations like Green Mountain Adaptive Sports and the Kelly Brush Foundation help riders purchase a bike.
Weaver’s bike was built by ReActive Adaptations, complete with three wheels — two up front and one behind — three sets of shocks and brakes, and hand pedals to move the machine. Her model, the Hammerhead, places riders in a prone position, but models like the Nuke are operated from a recumbent position. Sometimes a bike shop will work on an adaptive bike, but Weaver said she does all her own mechanic work.
It’s a misnomer that adaptive riders require special trails to ride, Weaver said — all they really need is three feet of clearance for the front wheels and relatively even ground. Many trails in Stowe already meet that requirement, but the Stowe Trails Partnership has been working for years to further expand adaptive trails.

Stowe currently has about seven miles of adaptive-ready terrain, most of which are in Cady Hill, according to Kenzie Brunner, director of the Stowe Trails Partnership. Before her current role, she worked for the Vermont Mountain Biking Association, taking annual inventories of adaptive terrain in Vermont. She said Stowe always came out on top.
The town has been expanding terrain since taking an adaptive trail assessment in 2020. Converting an adaptive-ready trail mostly involves widening the trail and features like bridges and berms
Charlies Bypass and Eagle Ridge in Cady Hill saw the biggest renovations, and Brunner said the organization might expand adaptive terrain in the Kirchner Woods over the coming years. Stowe Trails is also building a new adaptive and beginner-friendly trail behind the Village Inn, which should be ready by October.
“We aren’t dumbing down the trail,” Brunner said. “There’s some terrain my adaptive friends will fly over that I won’t even touch.”
Still, Weaver said they appreciated having guides who knew the trails and could call out potential hazards. Jeff Kauffman, a Stowe Trails Partnership member, was one of the guides for the event. He knows the trails like the back of his hand and was happy to facilitate the adaptive group ride.
“It takes a lot of courage to get out there,” Kauffman said, “It was really nice to see able-bodied riders cheer them on last weekend.”

Kennedy Jr. testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building earlier this year in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images).The Make America Healthy Again movement has generated a lot of discussion about public health. But the language MAHA proponents use to describe health and disease has also raised concerns among the disability and chronic illness communities.
I’m a researcher studying the rhetoric of health and medicine – and, specifically, the rhetoric of risk. This means I analyze the language used by public officials, institutions, health care providers and other groups in discussing health risks to decode the underlying beliefs and assumptions that can affect both policy and public sentiment about health issues.
As a scholar of rhetoric and the mother of an autistic child, in the language of MAHA I hear a disregard for the humanity of people with disabilities and a shift from supporting them to blaming them for their needs.
Such language goes all the way up to the MAHA movement’s highest-level leader, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is clearly evident in the report on children’s health published in May 2025 by the MAHA Commission, which was established by President Donald Trump and is led by Kennedy, as well as in the MAHA Commission’s follow-up draft recommendations, leaked on Aug. 15, 2025.
Like many people, I worry that the MAHA Commission’s rhetoric may signal a coming shift in how the federal government views the needs of people with disabilities – and its responsibilities for meeting them.
 Personal choice in health

One key concept for understanding the MAHA movement’s rhetoric, introduced by a prominent sociologist named Ulrich Beck, is what sociologists now call individualization of risk. Beck argued that modern societies and governments frame almost all health risks as being about personal choice and responsibility. That approach obscures how policies made by large institutions – such as governments, for example – constrain the choices that people are able to make.
In other words, governments and other institutions tend to focus on the choices that individuals make to intentionally deflect from their own responsibility for the other risk factors. The consequence, in many cases, is that the institution is off the hook for any responsibility for negative outcomes.
Beck, writing in 1986, pointed to nuclear plants in the Soviet Union as an example. People who lived near them reported health issues that they suspected were caused by radiation. But the government denied the existence of any evidence linking their woes to radiation exposure, implying that lifestyle choices were to blame. Some scholars have identified a similar dynamic in the U.S. today, where the government emphasizes personal responsibility while downplaying the effects of public policy on health outcomes.
 A shift in responsibility

Such a shift in responsibility is evident in how MAHA proponents, including Kennedy, discuss chronic illness and disabilities – in particular, autism.
In its May 2025 report on children’s health, the MAHA Commission describes the administration’s views on chronic diseases in children. The report notes that the increased prevalence in “obesity, diabetes, neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, mental health, autoimmune disorders and allergies” are “preventable trends.” It also frames the “major drivers” of these trends as “the food children are eating, the chemicals they are exposed to, the medications they are taking, and various changes to their lifestyle and behavior, particularly those related to physical activity, sleep and the use of technology.”
Notably, it makes no mention of systemic problems, such as limited access to nutritious food, poor air quality and lack of access to health care, despite strong evidence for the enormous contributions these factors make to children’s health. And regarding neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, it makes no mention of genetics, even though decades of research has found that genetics accounts for most of the risk of developing autism.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with studying the environmental factors that might contribute to autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In fact, many researchers believe that autism is caused by complex interactions between genes and environmental factors. But here’s where Beck’s concept of individualization becomes revealing: While the government is clearly not responsible for the genetic causes of chronic diseases, this narrow focus on lifestyle and environmental factors implies that autism can be prevented if these factors are altered or eliminated.
While this may sound like great news, there are a couple of problems. First, it’s simply not true. Second, the Trump administration and Kennedy have canceled tens of millions of dollars in research funding for autism – including on environmental causes – replacing it with an initiative with an unclear review process. This is an unusual move if the goal is to identify and mitigate environmental risk factors And finally, the government could use this claim to justify removing federally funded support systems that are essential for the well-being of autistic people and their families – and instead focus all its efforts on eliminating processed foods, toxins and vaccines.
People with autism and their families are already carrying a tremendous financial burden, even with the current sources of available support. Cuts to Medicaid and other fundingcould transfer the responsibility for therapies and other needs to individual families, leaving many of them to struggle with paying their medical bills. But it could also threaten the existence of an entire network of health care providers that people with disabilities rely on.
Even more worrisome is the implication that autism is a kind of damage caused by the environment rather than one of many normal variations in human neurological diversity – framing people with autism as a problem that society must solve.
 How language encodes value judgments

Such logic sets off alarm bells for anyone familiar with the history of eugenics, a movement that began with the idea of improving America by making its people healthier and quickly evolved to make judgments about who is and is not fit to participate in society.
Kennedy has espoused this view of autism throughout his career, even recently claiming that people with autism “will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem.”
Even if organic foods and a toxin-free household were the answer to reducing the prevalence of autism, the leaked MAHA Commission strategy report steers clear of recommending government regulation in industries such as food and agriculture, which would be needed to make these options affordable and widely available.
Instead, MAHA’s supposed interventions would remain lifestyle choices – and expensive ones, at that – left for individual families to make for themselves.
 Just asking questions

Kennedy and other MAHA proponents also employ another powerful rhetorical tactic: raising questions about topics that have already reached a scientific consensus. This tactic frames such questions as pursuits of truth, but their purpose is actually to create doubt. This tactic, too, is evident in the MAHA Commission’s reports.
This practice of “just asking questions” while ignoring already established answers is widely referred to as “sealioning.” The tactic, named for a notorious sea lion in an online comic called Wondermark, is considered a form of harassment. Like much of the rhetoric of the anti-vaccine movement, it
serves to undermine public trust in science and medicine. This is partly due to a widespread misunderstanding of scientific research – for example, understanding that scientific disagreement does not necessarily indicate that science as a process is flawed.
MAHA rhetoric thus continues a troubling trend in the anti-vaccine movement of calling all of science and Western medicine into question in order to further a specific agenda, regardless of the risks to public health.
The MAHA Commission’s goals are almost universally appealing – healthier food, healthier kids and a healthier environment for all Americans. But analyzing what is implied, minimized or left out entirely can illuminate a much more complex political and social agenda.

Every year since 1996, the High Road Strategy Center, a University of Wisconsin-Madison nonprofit think tank, produces the report to present information on the state of work and jobs, including who is “winning” and “being left out” of the economy, though future reports may be in trouble. 
Laura Dresser, a co-author of the report and High Road Strategy Center associate director, said in a statement that the 2025 data shows “some real strengths for working Wisconsin owing to the strong recovery from pandemic shutdowns.” 
“Long-standing inequalities are still with us, and federal policy puts substantial clouds on the horizon,” Dresser said. “I’m especially concerned about the administration’s attacks on the integrity of federal economic data.”
 Laura Dresser
Joel Rogers, director of the center and a UW-Madison professor, and Leslie Vasquez, outreach specialist and communications director, are also authors of the report that was released the Friday before Labor Day. 
Dresser’s concern about federal jobs data stems from President Donald Trump’s decision last month to remove Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from her position after a dismal jobs report that showed hiring slowed in July and was weaker in May and June than previously reported. He falsely claimed the reports were rigged as his justification. 
The report warns that the approach being taken by Trump is a “disaster for economic decision making and for public trust.” 
“Good economic decisions require reliable data,” the authors stated in the report. “Without reliable independent data, we cannot understand the economy nor, more narrowly, can the High Road Strategy Center continue confidently producing reports that draw on it. With hopes for continued national commitment to reliable data, and fears about the quality of what politically motivated ‘revisions’ will do, we will anxiously monitor changes in leadership and data at the BLS.”
Wage median reaches high, gaps ongoing 
The report found the median wage for Wisconsin workers — $25.01 per hour — reached a record high for the second year in a row, though the report says this doesn’t represent the full story when it comes to workers’ wages. 
While Wisconsin’s median wage reached a new high, a difference in wages exists among workers based on gender, race and ethnicity. Men’s median wage — $27.05 — in 2024 was more than $4 per hour higher than women’s median of $22.97, a 15% difference. 
When race is considered, the differences become more stark. White men have the highest wages at a median of $28.54 per hour. The median for white women was about 17% less at $23.66 per hour. 
The median wages for workers of color fell considerably below that of white men and women. Black men and women had about the same hourly median wage at $19.93 and $20.29 — 29% less than white men. Hispanic men had a median wage of $18.56 and Hispanic women a median of $17.57.
The report also found that over 800,000 workers — nearly a third of Wisconsin’s workforce — make less than $20 per hour. 
The report says raising the minimum wage would be one way to help close these gaps. Wisconsin’s minimum wage is currently $7.25, a number in line with the federal minimum wage and that has been unchanged since 2009. 
“Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would not only be politically popular but would directly or indirectly raise the wages of 231,800 (or 18%) of women workers, 36,200 (or 25.6%) Black workers, and 50,200 (or 26.6%) Hispanic workers in the state,” the report states. 
In response to the report, Peter Rickman, president and business manager of the Milwaukee Area Service & Hospitality Workers (MASH) Union, also urged Wisconsin lawmakers to make increasing the state’s wages a priority this fall.
“The service and hospitality working class needs comprehensive living wage legislation with a $20 per hour floor, yearly adjustment for inflation, reduction of the tip penalty, and restoration of local control,” Rickman said. “Democrats and Republicans alike tell us that they want to represent the working class. Now is their time to show us by introducing and passing comprehensive living wage legislation.”
Meanwhile, Wisconsin reached a record of 3,058,500 jobs in July, but the state’s overall jobs growth has been weak. 
Wisconsin has added about 1,400 jobs per month in 2025 — growing about half as fast as the national rate. According to the report, the state has 2% more jobs than before the pandemic, while the U.S. overall has seen 5% more jobs. 
Unemployment remains low in Wisconsin with a 3.1% rate in July 2025. Wisconsin also has a 66.4% labor force participation rate, higher than the national average of 62.6%. 
“The jobs and unemployment data are strong, but the economy is cooling off after the rapid recovery from pandemic shutdowns,” the report states. 
It also finds the economic softening mirrors the national environment where analysts have warned of a slow down or even a recession.
Federal policies undermine growth 
Federal policy changes under the Trump administration are contributing to these outlooks, according to the report.
“For workers, the warning signs and the brewing economic storm of tariffs, immigration crackdowns and federal disinvestment are especially concerning,” the report states. “While the current labor market is solid, these substantial disruptions may not only slow our overall economic growth, but also reduce the power of working people, as opportunities become more scarce.”
The report predicts that tariffs, which are taxes on imports to the U.S., will raise the price of goods for American consumers, the Trump administration’s deportation agenda will undermine the country’s economic strength by hobbling jobs growth and federal cuts to social safety nets will hit the state’s low-wage workers hardest. 
“Economists and investors have observed that immigration changes may constrain economic growth even more than the high cost of tariffs. Employers are already complaining about the impact of the raids on their workforce and customers,” the report states. 
According to the report, 320,000 immigrants reside in Wisconsin and generate $23 billion in economic output annually. In 2023, federal data found that immigrants constituted 7% of Wisconsin’s workforce. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in Wisconsin have doubled under the Trump administration, and of late, the administration, which promised to focus on “criminals,” has been shifting towards deporting people with no criminal convictions and no pending criminal charges. 
“Despite considerable economic and cultural contributions, immigrants face persistent barriers to fully participating in the workforce and community life,” the report states. “The current administration’s anti-immigrant policies have increased fear and dampened new immigration, constricting the Wisconsin economy where labor markets are already tight.”
The Trump administration has also approved cuts to federal Medicaid and food assistance programs, which Gov. Tony Evers’ administration estimates could cost Wisconsin over $284 million and puts thousands at risk of losing support.
“The federal budget, enacted this summer, contains hundreds of provisions with disturbing implications for working people. It holds enormous tax breaks for the rich,” the report states, noting that an analysis by the Institute Taxation and Economic Policy Wisconsin found the “annual tax break to Wisconsin’s richest 1% will be $67,000. And the tax break for the bottom fifth of households in the state? Just $70.” 
“All of this, and more, is coming and will hit lower wage working families across the state especially hard,” the report states. 
The upheaval in federal policies also comes as participation in unions in Wisconsin, which the report says helps with improving conditions for workers, are down as a result of state policies. 
From 2011 to 2024, unionization in Wisconsin fell from 14% to 7%. Over the same time period, union coverage nationally only fell two percentage points from 13% to 11%. 
That drop in Wisconsin, the report notes, comes after over a decade of public sector unions being disempowered in Wisconsin by Act 10, the state law signed by former Gov. Scott Walker in 2011 that significantly reduced collective bargaining powers of public sector employees. 
In addition, the Trump administration has targeted unions, ending collective bargaining for a million federal employees — four out of five federal workers represented by unions at over a dozen federal agencies. He has also fired members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the agency tasked with protecting labor rights, for “unduly disfavoring the interests of employers.” 
“Despite federal and state policies that have impeded unionization over the last half century,” the report states, “unions continue to provide workers with the means to improve wages and working conditions in their jobs.”

Most of the world observes International Workers’ Day on May 1 or the first Monday in May each year, but not the United States and Canada. Instead, Americans and Canadians have celebrated Labor Day as a national holiday on the first Monday in September since 1894, 12 years after the first observance of Labor Day in New York City.
The celebrations aren’t the same.
In much of Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the event commonly called May Day honors workers’ political and economic power, often with demonstrations by socialist or workers’ parties and tributes to national labor rights. America’s Labor Day features labor union parades in many places, but for most Americans, it’s less about organized labor and more about barbecues, beach days and back-to-school sales.
Both holidays, however, arose during the same period, in the U.S. nearly 150 years ago, in the midst of an explosive labor uprising in America’s industrial heartland. Their founding united native-born and immigrant workers in an extraordinary alliance to demand an eight-hour workday at a time when American workers toiled an average of 10 or more hours daily, six days a week.
The call for shorter hours was rooted in a big idea: that workers’ days belonged to them, even if employers owned their workplaces and paid for their work. That idea inspired the loftiest goals of a growing labor movement that spanned from Chicago and New York to Stockholm and Saint Petersburg. And the labor activism of the late 1800s still casts a distant light on Labor Day today, carrying a vital message about the struggle for control of workers’ daily lives.
I’m a historian at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I study the history of labor. The fight for shorter hours is no longer a top issue for organized labor in the U.S.. But it was a crusade for the eight-hour day that brought together the diverse coalition of labor groups that created Labor Day and May Day in the 1880s.

Labor Day’s radical roots
Led by socialist-leaning trade unions, Labor Day’s founders included skilled, native-born craft workers defending control over their trades, immigrant laborers seeking relief from daylong drudgery, and revolutionary anarchists who saw the quest for control of the workers’ day as a step toward seizing factories and smashing the state.
They originally chose Sept. 5, 1882, for the first Labor Day to coincide with a general assembly in New York City of what was then the largest and broadest association of American workers, the Knights of Labor. Two years later, labor leaders moved the annual event to the first Monday in September, giving the majority of workers a two-day weekend for the first time.
As Labor Day parades and picnics spread, many American cities and states soon made it an official holiday. But since few employers gave workers the day off in its early years, Labor Day likewise became “a virtual one-day general strike in many cities,” according to historians Michael Kazin and Steven Ross.
American roots of May Day
My students come from working-class, mostly immigrant families, and Chicago’s history of labor conflict is all around our downtown campus in the heart of what were once meatpacking plants, stockyards and crowded immigrant neighborhoods.
My office is about 12 blocks from the spot – surrounded today by upscale office buildings – where the eight-hour movement reached a bloody climax in the battle of Haymarket Square. May Day commemorates that battle.
On May 1, 1886, unions of skilled workers organized by their crafts or trades led a nationwide general strike for the eight-hour day. They were joined by radical socialists, militant anarchists and many members of the Knights of Labor. More than 100,000 workers took part across the country.
The most dramatic demonstrations happened in Chicago, which had become the second-largest city in the U.S. after years of swift growth. Nearly 40,000 striking Chicago workers shut down much of that burgeoning industrial, agricultural and commercial hub. Three days later, a bomb thrown at a rally in Haymarket Square killed seven police officers, sparking a sweeping nationwide crackdown on labor activism.
In 1889, socialist trade unions and workers’ parties, meeting in Paris for the first congress of a new Socialist International, proclaimed May 1 an international workers’ holiday. They were partly following the lead of the new American Federation of Labor, which had called for renewed strikes on the anniversary of the 1886 action.
And they were honoring the memory of the eight labor activists who had been tried and convicted for the Haymarket bombing solely on the basis of their speeches and radical politics, in what was widely viewed as a rigged trial. Four “Haymarket martyrs” had been hanged and a fifth died by suicide before he could be executed.

An earlier labor win
Though May 1 had long been associated with European celebrations of springtime, its modern meaning has deeper American roots that precede the Haymarket tragedy. It was on that date in 1867 that workers in Chicago celebrated an earlier victory.
At the end of the Civil War, campaigns for an eight-hour workday arose in cities across the country, championing a common interpretation of the abolition of slavery: for many workers, emancipation meant that employers purchased only their labor, not their lives.
Employers might monopolize workers’ means of making a living, but not their hours and days.
The movement led to laws declaring an eight-hour day in six states, including Illinois, where the new rule went into effect on May 1, 1867. But employers widely disobeyed or circumvented the laws, and states failed to enforce them while they lasted, so workers continued to struggle for a shorter workday.
Seizing the day
In the 19th century, American workers’ labor came to be measured by how long they worked and how much they were paid. While they were divided by their widely different wages, they were united by the generally uniform hours at each workplace.
The demand for a shorter workday without a pay cut was designed to appeal to all wage earners no matter who they were, where they were from, or what they did for a living.
Labor leaders said shorter hours meant employers would have to hire more people, creating jobs and boosting hourly pay. Spending less time on the job would enable workers to become bigger consumers, spurring economic growth.
Having “eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, and eight hours for what we will,” a popular labor movement refrain, would also leave more time for education, organization and political action.
Most broadly, the fight for shorter hours encapsulated workers’ struggle to control their own time, both on and off the job. That far-reaching struggle included efforts to limit the number of years people spent earning a living by ending child labor and creating pensions for retired workers – a topic I’m currently researching.
Benjamin Franklin famously said, “Time is money,” meaning that time off costs money that workers could be making on the job. But the message of the movement for a shorter workday was that the worth of workers’ lives could not be calculated in dollars and cents.
Diverging holidays
In the Haymarket battle’s aftermath, the alliance of radicals and reformers, factory operatives and skilled artisans, U.S.-born workers and immigrant laborers began to come apart. And as union leaders in the American Federation of Labor parted ways with socialists and anarchists, each side of the divided workers’ movement claimed one of the two labor days as its own, making the holidays appear increasingly opposed and losing sight of their shared foundation in the campaign for a shorter workday.
Conservative politicians and employers hostile to unions began to equate labor organizing with bomb throwing. In response, trade unions seeking acceptance as part of American industry and democracy displayed their allegiance on Labor Day by waving the American flag, singing patriotic songs and portraying themselves as proud, native-born Americans as opposed to foreign workers with subversive ideas.
Many political radicals and the immigrant workers among whom they found much of their following, meanwhile, came to identify more with the international workers’ movement associated with May Day than with American business and politics. They disavowed May Day’s origins among American trade unions, even as many trade unions distanced themselves from the radical roots of Labor Day. By the turn of the century, May Day moved further from the center of American culture, while Labor Day became more mainstream and less militant.

20th-century gains and losses
In the 20th century, labor unions won shorter hours for many of their members across the country. But they detached that demand from the broader agenda of workers’ autonomy and international solidarity.
They gained a landmark achievement with the federal enactment of the eight-hour day and 40-hour workweek for many industries during the 1930s. At that point, economist John Maynard Keynes projected that the rising productivity of labor would enable 21st-century wage earners to work just three hours a day.
Workers’ productivity did keep climbing as Keynes predicted, and their wages rose apace – until the 1970s. But their work hours did not decline, leaving the three-hour day a forgotten vision of what organized labor might achieve.

(Photo by Brian Logan/U.S. Forest Service)The U.S. Department of Agriculture, parent agency of the U.S. Forest Service, announced Wednesday that it is moving ahead with plans to rescind a rule that has restricted logging and construction on millions of acres of federal lands in the American West for more than two decades.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a written statement that the agency intends to open public comments Friday on its proposal to end the so-called “Roadless Rule,” an act that will affect as much as 45 million acres of federal land as well as millions of Americans who live near it.

Opening a public comment period is the first step in repealing the rule. According to Rollins’ statement, members of the public will have until Sept. 19 to offer their opinions on the repeal, a timeframe that opponents of the plan denounced as inadequate.
Roads are a key prerequisite for large-scale logging and mining projects, and the rule — enacted in 2001 at the end of the Clinton administration — has limited the number of development projects on Forest Service land.
Rollins’ announcement was expected. She had announced the Trump administration’s intent at a conference of western governors in June. The first Trump administration also attempted to eliminate the Roadless Rule, but that move was halted by lawsuits, and the Biden administration dropped the effort.

 Environmental groups say rule’s rollback will harm conservation efforts

In Wednesday’s announcement, Rollins said rescinding the roadless rule would allow local land managers to make decisions on development and logging.
“It is vital that we properly manage our federal lands to create healthy, resilient, and productive forests for generations to come. We look forward to hearing directly from the people and communities we serve as we work together to implement productive and commonsense policy for forest land management,” she said.
Tree thinning could also reduce wildfire risks, she suggested.
Environmental groups, already prepared for Rollins’ announcement, were quick to denounce it as harmful and out of touch.
“America’s national forests give us clean air, water, wildlife, and the freedom for all to enjoy the outdoors,” said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society, in a prepared statement, “but now they are the latest target in this administration’s unpopular push to give away our lands to drill, mine, and log. Gutting the Roadless Rule — which has protected our forests for 25 years — would be the single largest rollback of conservation protections in our nation’s history.”
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, and forests in Colorado and Idaho have already been exempted from it under state-specific guidelines.
 How would Alaska be affected?

Ninety-six percent of the Forest Service’s inventoried roadless areas are located in 12 Western states, and no state is more affected than Alaska, which has almost a third of the 45 million acres affected by the pending change.
Alaska is home to the Tongass National Forest, a West Virginia-sized stretch of islands and waterways in the Southeast Alaska panhandle that make up the largest surviving temperate rainforest in the world.

Until the 1980s, the area was also home to a vast logging program and pulp wood mills that employed thousands of people.
“Across Southeast Alaska, we see the irreparable damage from so many decades of unsustainable clear-cut logging in the scarred landscapes and decimated fish and wildlife habitats — we cannot and will not go back to that, and we know that’s what public comment will show once again,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a statement released Wednesday.
Some Alaska Native tribes in the region support keeping the rule in place, as do some tourism businesses.
“Rescinding the Roadless Rule will devastate our community just as we are beginning to heal from clear-cut logging of the past. It’s clear the people making these decisions in Washington, D.C., don’t care about how it will harm those of us who live here and have lived here for thousands of years,” said President Joel Jackson of the Organized Village of Kake, which has repeatedly intervened in lawsuits seeking to defend the rule.
“We are the people of the forest and salmon people — our lives and our voices should count — this process makes it clear they won’t,” Jackson said.
 Industry leaders, Republicans support repeal of ‘Roadless Rule’

Repealing the Roadless Rule also has powerful support in the region. Local electric utilities have advocated a repeal in order to ease the construction of clean hydroelectric power plants. The Alaska Forest Association, representing the logging industry, supports it, as do mining proponents.
Ten members of the U.S. House’s Committee on Natural Resources were in Anchorage on Wednesday as part of a weeklong tour of the state.
U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, said he believes the Roadless Rule “has really handicapped us in a number of areas,” including in firefighting.
In July, a wildfire swept through parts of Grand Canyon National Park, destroying a historic lodge and dozens of other structures.
Gosar said he believes the federal government needs to take a new approach on federal land in order to thin trees and reduce wildfire risks.
In Utah, which has 4 million acres of inventoried roadless land, Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy said she frequently hears from constituents upset about restrictions on the public use of federal land and supports the repeal.
“One of the complaints my constituents have frequently is that the federal government manages a lot of our resources but isn’t always great at listening to the people who live among the resources. … This Roadless Rule decision is a direct result of complaints from people who live with the Roadless Rule and the unintended consequences it’s having on economies and on resources,” she said.

U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle is a Democrat from Oregon also traveling with the committee. Her state has almost 2 million acres of inventoried roadless area, much of it in her district, but she said she would like to see a more balanced approach than the one being offered by the Trump administration.
“We have to protect our federal lands. We have to make sure that the public has access to our public land, and we have to make sure that we aren’t just wholesale taking out the protections that we worked really, really hard for, because we owe it to the people of this country to protect those lands that truly are theirs,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, is the top Democratic member of the resources committee, and wasn’t on the trip to Alaska.
In an emailed statement, he said Rollins “is steamrolling ahead with Trump’s plan to deliver America’s last wild forests to corporate polluters.”
“Democrats will fight this reckless scheme and stand with Tribes, hunters, anglers, and families who rely on these forests — not corporations looking to cash in,” he said.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

To coincide with the Labor Day holiday, Oxfam America released the Best States to Work Index (BSWI), and the Tar Heel state is far from the top.
Patricia Stottlemyer, senior domestic policy adviser at Oxfam America, notes that North Carolina came in 52nd in its new analysis that examines labor policies in all 50 states as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico.
A key reason is that North Carolina lawmakers have not raised the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for 16 years.
“That minimum wage has been in place since 2009,” Stottlemyer told NC Newsline. “What that means in North Carolina is that the state minimum wage only covers 18% of what it would [need] to support a family of four. It’s woefully inadequate when it comes to enabling families to support themselves.”
By comparison, Virginia leads the Southeast region in compensation with a minimum wage of $12.41 per hour.
Stottlemyer said it’s a common misconception that when states support workers, that means bad things for the economy.
“That’s just not true. Our index actually looks at several metrics of community well-being, including economic measures and finds that there’s a strong positive correlation between states that have a healthy and robust labor policy landscape.”
In CNBC’s annual business ranking, North Carolina received its lowest marks for quality of life (earning a C-) and cost of living (earning a C+) – an acknowledgement of the rising cost of living in the state.
Beyond compensation, Oxfam underscores that North Carolina lacks critical workplace protections.
North Carolina does not provide a heat safety standard for outdoor workers, nor does it provide specific protection for warehouse workers, according to Oxfam.
The Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability recognizes heat as an escalating crisis with a need for governance to protect workers from heat-related illness.
Workers would also benefit from fixed and fair scheduling. Unpredictable hours can be especially problematic for those whose duties include providing care for children, the elderly, or family members with disabilities.
Leave time is another factor.
“There’s no guarantee that workers have access to paid family and medical leave or paid sick leave,” notes Stottlemyer.
North Carolina is also held back in this year’s index for its “right-to-work” laws. The state ranks at the bottom with South Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas, Texas and Utah for having no support for workers organizing, whether by public or private employees.
In Oxfam’s companion report on the best states for working women, North Carolina is just edged out of the last spot by Mississippi. Again, a lack of paid family leave for working women causes the state’s ranking to bottom out.
“Black mothers in particular are disproportionately likely to be heads of their households and breadwinners. So, if they have access to paid leave, they’re able to stay in the workforce and juggle their caregiving responsibilities as well,” explained Stottlemyer.
State access to paid sick days was a key recommendation in a new report released last week by the N.C. Department of Administration’s Council for Women and Youth Involvement.
This report, “Investing in Economic Opportunity for Women in North Carolina,” found that while the gender wage gap for women has improved over the last seven years, fewer mothers are in the workforce compared to fathers. And North Carolina women working full-time spent 20 to 26% of their annual income on infant childcare.
The cost of childcare posed the greatest burden for Latina and Native American women in North Carolina, based on their earnings.
“Today’s findings reflect the disparities and discrimination women in North Carolina and across the country continue to face, especially women of color,” said Jesseca Boyer, vice president for policy and strategic initiatives at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR).
And there is a ripple effect for the next generation.
North Carolina ranks lowest nationally in preschool enrollment for 3-year-olds, and second lowest among Southeastern state for the enrollment of 4-year-olds in preschool.
Oxfam and the Institute for Women’s Policy Research come to the same conclusion in their respective reports: North Carolina would greatly benefit from raising the minimum wage, indexed  to the cost of living, and by enacting legislation to require employers to provide workers with paid time off for short-term illness or to care for the health of a loved one.

Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State UniversityDecades ago, I was a nonunion journalist whose standard of living depended heavily on the bargaining prowess of the United Auto Workers union.
I worked for a group of Michigan daily newspapers located in a few cities where General Motors was the top employer or among the top three. My wages, cost of living increases and benefits were closely linked to financial packages won by the UAW for its then hundreds of thousands of factory workers at what was called the Big Three automakers.
Michigan economists and policymakers closely watched national UAW contract negotiations, typically held every three or four years, to assess how those contracts would impact the state’s economy. So went the UAW and the automakers, so went Michigan in those days.
A record 26% percent of Michigan workers belonged to a labor union in 1989. Today it’s just over half that at 13.4% The UAW and the rest of organized labor no longer have the power they once did to boost the state’s overall prosperity.
The UAW celebrated its 90th birthday on Aug. 26, appropriately just a few days before Labor Day. It was an event largely devoid of media coverage, an indicator of the shrunken role the union plays in steering the state and national economy.
UAW membership has fallen from a peak of 1.7 million in 1979 to about 375,000 last year, according to its annual report filed with the Labor Department. That largely reflects a similar decline in the number of factory jobs at domestic automakers, which are now known as the Detroit Three, no longer the Big Three.
Only about 150,000 UAW members work at GM, Ford and Stellantis. Most are employed at universities, hospitals, state governments and nonprofits.
A battle-hardened nonagenarian, the UAW faces existential threats from a variety of forces. They include increased factory automation, President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade policies, the auto industry’s choppy transition to electric vehicles, the growth of nonunion automakers in the South and discord at Solidarity House, the UAW’s headquarters in Detroit.
The past couple of years gave hope of a turnaround for the union’s prospects. Fiery UAW President Shawn Fain negotiated record labor contracts with the Detroit Three in 2023. President Joe Biden, promising to be the most pro-labor president in U.S. history, walked a picket line with striking UAW workers at GM, something no other U.S. president had done.

Then came Trump. The new president quickly slapped punishing tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum coming from Canada, Mexico and other countries in attempt to drive more auto production to the U.S.
It was a move that Fain, who harbored a simmering anger about free trade with Canada and Mexico, supported. But the UAW has since become miffed about Trump’s trade agreement with Japan, which lowered auto tariffs from an initial 25% assessed by the president to 15%.
The UAW said it was “deeply angered” by the deal, which it claimed could give imported cars and trucks from nonunion Japanese automakers a cost advantage over U.S.-built vehicles by the Detroit Three.
What’s more, Trump’s tariffs are costing U.S. automakers billions of dollars, likely taking a big chunk out of this year’s profit-sharing checks for UAW workers.

And so far, the tariffs haven’t led to any new auto manufacturing jobs. Instead, there were 10,600 fewer motor vehicle and parts jobs in July than there were last December.
The UAW also is fighting to unionize workers at Detroit Three electric vehicle battery plants, some of which are being built with foreign joint-venture partners.
It appears to have won an organizing drive this month at the BlueOval SK battery plant, a joint-venture between Ford and South Korea-based SK On in Kentucky. But the company is challenging 41 ballots that could change the outcome.
The loss of a union election at the plant—co-owned by Ford, no less—would be a staggering blow to the UAW’s Southern organizing strategy.
Meanwhile, Fain is trying to hang on to his job. A court-appointed monitor in June found the UAW leader engaged in Trump-like retaliatory tactics against the union’s secretary-treasurer. A few union locals are seeking an internal trial for Fain on alleged financial and other misconduct.

But for all the talk of auto jobs moving to Mexico and China, a boom in factory automation could be the biggest threat to the UAW becoming a centenarian.
Hyundai’s new nonunion, highly automated assembly plant in Georgia features robot dogs that work with humans in building vehicles. The robots aren’t paid, don’t get benefits or go on strike.
The South Korean automaker has about two human workers for every robot in the plant. The industry average is seven workers per robot, according to the Wall Street Journal, so there is a lot of room for automakers to robotize their factories.
But existential threats are nothing new for the UAW. For its 90th birthday, the UAW released a highlight video showcasing its hard-won accomplishments that included organizing Detroit automakers, creating the middle class and advancing civil rights.
The fight continues.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Lower Platte South Natural Resources District moved to hire its assistant general manager for the job left vacant by the recent resignation of general manager Mike Sousek.
On Aug. 20, the NRD board voted to negotiate a contract with Assistant General Manager David Potter to become the next GM. The vote came after the board rejected a proposal to appoint a committee to conduct an outside search for candidates.
Potter, who has worked nine years for the NRD, said Friday that a contract was still under negotiation. It could be voted on at the NRD board’s next meeting in September.
In July, Sousek resigned the $178,000-a-year job a month after being placed on suspension with pay.
There has been no public comment on why Sousek was disciplined or why he resigned. But his exit came a couple weeks after the settlement of a lawsuit filed by a female NRD employee who maintained that she had been bypassed for the NRD’s top job because she was a woman. The job went to Sousek.
McKenzie Barry, who had worked for the Lower Platte South NRD for 22 years, filed the gender discrimination lawsuit, claiming, among other things, that two members of the committee interviewing candidates told her that the NRD wasn’t ready to hire a female for the top job.
Sousek, who had served as general manager the past two years, did not immediately return a phone call left Friday seeking comment.
Bob Anderson, the chairman of the Lower Platte South NRD Board, said Friday that there was strong support from the board to pursue a contract with Potter rather than pursue a national search for candidates.
Potter had served as an elected member of the Lower Platte South NRD Board prior to his hiring as assistant general manager. A resident of Valparaiso, he is also a former member of the Butler County Board.
The Lower Platte South NRD covers six counties in southeast Nebraska. It operates nine wildlife management areas and maintains 50 miles of recreational trails, and works with landowners to reduce erosion and manage groundwater use.
Most recently, it has been engaged in talks with Cass County to find an alternate path for a recreation trail linking Lincoln and Omaha. The talks came after the Cass County Board declined in May to affirm a route for the trail that had been approved by the five-member board prior to the November elections. Those elections changed the membership of the board.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0065-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-01 06:56:38.750626

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)Implementation of a new state law requiring Ten Commandments displays in public school classrooms varies across Arkansas as some district superintendents await the results of a lawsuit challenging the legislation.
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks blocked four Northwest Arkansas districts involved in the lawsuit — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale — from enforcing Act 573 on Aug. 4, hours before the law was set to take effect.
Brooks also issued a temporary restraining order against the Conway School District Thursday and ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from Conway schools by 5 p.m. Friday.
Judge orders Central Arkansas district to remove Ten Commandments displays

The Arkansas Advocate last week emailed the state’s public school districts to see whether any had received monetary or poster donations. According to the law, posters must be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions. Displays that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
Of the 45 districts (43 traditional and two charter school districts) not involved in the ongoing litigation that responded to the Advocate’s survey by Friday, 39 said they had not received donations and five said they had — Farmington, Harrison, Lafayette County, Omaha and Rogers. 
The Batesville School District did not specify in its response whether the district had received donations, but communications coordinator Candace Morrow said the district was monitoring the ongoing litigation and guidance from the Arkansas Department of Education.
“Any future decisions will be made carefully, always with the best interests and safety of our students at the center,” Morrow said. 
The Brookland School District had not received donations, according to superintendent George Kennedy, who noted building principals have reported parents asking about the displays. However, no offers to purchase the posters have been made, Kennedy said.
Superintendent Lee Smith said the Mena School District also hadn’t received funds, but was contacted by a local congregation, Cherry Hill Baptist Church, about doing so. The district is awaiting a decision by the court, he said.
“We will comply with the law when/if the court rules in favor of the law requirement and the funds are provided to us,” Smith wrote in an email. 
The Harrison School District received 150 posters, but they have not yet been hung up, according to superintendent Stewart Pratt, who noted the district was in its third week of school. The task is on their to-do list, he said. 
Meanwhile, the Lafayette County School District reported being in the process of hanging up its donated posters, and the Omaha School District was making preparations to do the same. 
“We had our 10 Commandment posters donated this past week, and we are in the process of flattening them out, laminat[ing] them and then get em up!” superintendent John McCleary wrote in an email. 
The Rogers School District reported receiving some donated posters while the Farmington School District reported receiving 210. Both Northwest Arkansas districts said they were awaiting further legal clarification about next steps. 
“We have not hung any posters,” Farmington superintendent Jon Laffoon said in an email. “We are awaiting further clarity following the recent preliminary injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on August 4, as well as the Attorney General’s appeal.”
Legal proceedings
Seven families with religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed a federal lawsuit in June that argues the law is unconstitutional because it violates their religious freedom rights. Supporters of the legislation and lawyers for the state have argued the tenets are a historical document that influenced the country’s founders in the creation of the nation’s laws and legal system.
Brooks disagreed and issued a preliminary injunction in early August that blocked the law from being applied at the four Northwest Arkansas school districts named as defendants in the case. 
On Aug. 22, Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a notice of appeal and plaintiffs’ attorneys asked the court’s permission to add the Conway School District as a defendant and two families from the district as plaintiffs in the ongoing lawsuit. The Conway School District hung Ten Commandments displays in its schools, according to court filings.
Christian groups, Arkansas lawmakers defend Ten Commandments law

Brooks granted permission to add the new parties to the case Wednesday. Attorneys filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on behalf of two Conway district families, which Brooks granted Thursday.
Following Brooks’ preliminary injunction on Aug. 4, the ACLU of Arkansas warned districts not to implement the law. Backers of the legislation responded by encouraging people to donate to the campaign to place Ten Commandments displays in schools. Some followed the latter’s advice in Pine Bluff where ministers donated posters to the local school district, according to The Pine Bluff Commercial.
The Fayetteville School District reported receiving hundreds of donated posters prior to Brooks’ injunction, according to court filings. A Springdale School District spokesperson told the Advocate last week that his district had not received any donations. A Siloam Springs District spokesperson said they don’t comment on pending litigation. Bentonville, the other district named in the original lawsuit, did not respond to the Advocate’s questions about donations by publication. 
Laws similar to Arkansas’ are being challenged in neighboring states. A federal appeals court blocked a Louisiana law in June. Meanwhile, a federal judge temporarily blocked a Texas law from taking full effect in nearly a dozen districts in August.

More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.

Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.

– Craig Greenberg, mayor of Louisville 


Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct. 22.

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public opinion in Idaho strongly opposes the sale of public lands, with a recent poll showing 96% of registered voters believe public lands should remain public, a sentiment shared across both Democratic and Republican parties. This opposition stems from concerns about losing access, damaging the natural infrastructure that supports the economy, and harming wildlife, with the public actively holding elected officials accountable on the issue.
New poll finds 96% Idaho voters say public lands should remain in public hands

U.S. Sen. Jim Risch , R-Idaho, has stated, after reviewing the Senate Energy and Natural Resources reconciliation language: I do not support the proposed provision to sell public lands.
U.S. Sens. Risch and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, have made statements opposing the sale of more than three million acres of public land as part of the federal budget reconciliation bill. The land-sale provision was stripped from the House version of the spending bill thanks to opposition from legislators including U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho.
Simpson supports efforts to preserve Idaho’s public lands from being sold or transferred and to maintain multiple-use access for recreation, grazing, and ranching, opposing federal rules he believes undermine the “multiple use” mandate and advocating for bills that keep these lands in public hands. He cosponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act to ban the sale or transfer of most public lands and is a vice-chairman of the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus.
Idaho state legislators from both parties celebrated the death of a federal proposal that would have made millions of acres of public lands, including in Idaho, available to be sold off. On June 30, 43 Republican Idaho state legislators signed a letter thanking Simpson, Crapo and Risch for protecting access to public lands during the recent federal budget reconciliation process.
In July 2025, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, voted against the Public Lands in Public Hands Act and a related amendment to block the sale of federal lands in Nevada and Utah. This was the only “no” vote from Idaho’s congressional delegation.
He was not included in a thank you letter from Idaho Republican lawmakers for protecting public lands.
“Public lands and access to those lands are a cornerstone of Idaho’s identity,” the letter states. “Thanks to your efforts, these amazing spaces will remain in public hands. By ensuring access to hunting, fishing, grazing, and outdoor recreation, Idaho will continue to look like the Idaho we all know and love.”
We, the Idaho public need to initiate a process to elect a new 1st District representative who will wholeheartedly keep Idaho public lands and access as a cornerstone of Idaho’s identity.  Furthermore, elect a 1st District representative who opposes the sale of Idaho lands and keep Idaho’s amazing spaces in public hands.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.
Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

With vintage war planes hanging overhead from the ceiling, Sanford L. Jones Sr. of Richmond peered out at an audience of about 300, mostly tourists. With him were Emily Drake of Pennsylvania and Lewis Harned of Wisconsin, ready for a discussion to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
The deadliest conflict in history — causing the deaths of 70 million to 85 million people, more than half of them civilians — officially came to an end on Sept. 2, 1945. Terms of surrender were signed by Japanese officials aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay and accepted by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
On the museum stage in New Orleans, veteran Drake, a stenographer with the Women’s Army Corps during the war, was the first to take her seat. She was joined by Jones and Harned, a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in the war and a longtime U.S. Armed Forces doctor.

Before host Peter Crean started the panel discussion, Drake softly made a comment to Jones that her microphone picked up and broadcast to the crowd.
“I’m nervous,” she said. Jones immediately replied, “Well, I am, too.”
Smatterings of laughter could be heard in the audience, then applause. It was a gesture praising three veterans who bravely offered so much during the war and now were a bit nervous before a friendly crowd. Their humility was on display.
“Well, Emily,” added Jones. “We are here because not many of us are left.”
According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as of January 2025, fewer than 66,000 U.S. World War II veterans remain alive out of the 16.4 million Americans who served during the war. This number represents less than 1% of the total who served. By 2034, only about 1,000 are projected to still be with us.
Museum official Crean said at the commemoration ceremony that the life of each of the three people on stage was emblematic of the strength and bravery of the men and women who served in World War II.
Here is the story of one of them, Kentuckian Sanford Logan Jones Sr.
From Lost Creek to San Giovanni and back to Lost Creek

Jones was a U.S. Army Air Forces gunner on B-24 Liberators in the European theater. He received a recommendation of valor for his 35 combat missions “in air battles of great intensity.”
On Sept. 22, Jones will turn 100. He was born near Lost Creek in Eastern Kentucky’s Perry County. “It was a very isolated and rural place with no running water, no electricity, no phone,” he said. 
Lost Creek, 10 miles long and mainly in Breathitt County, is a tributary of Troublesome Creek which flows into the North Fork of the Kentucky River. Many homes in the watershed were destroyed in a flash flood in July 2022.
Sanford’s father, Dave Jones, was a coal miner. His mother, Grace Elizabeth Terry, was an elementary school teacher. The couple had two girls and four boys.
Sanford attended a one-room school in Lost Creek. One teacher served eight grades.  “I still can see that pot-bellied stove in that school,” he said.
He graduated from elementary school in 1940 and then attended a school in Breathitt County through his junior year.
Jones remembered walking to church as a 16-year-old with a friend on Sunday Dec. 7, 1941.

“We were walking back home from church later that afternoon and saw a crowd at a house,” he said.  “We stopped by to see what was going on and we found people listening to a Philco radio, something about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The next day President Roosevelt talked about the day of infamy.
“The people had serious faces. I thought this will probably mean I’m going to war.”
In November 1943, before he finished high school, Jones got a draft notice from the Army in Hazard. That led him to training in a series of Army bases.  
“I especially remember the marching songs I learned,” he said. “Left, right, left, right. One, two, three, four. You had a good home and you left it.”
In Biloxi, Mississippi, young Jones was assigned to a gunnery school. He was soon ready for combat. On Oct. 16, 1944, he landed at San Giovanni Airfield in Italy to join the U.S. Army 15th Air Forces, 304th Bombardment Wing, 455th Bombardment Group.
A month later, he flew his first combat mission. It was to Munich, Germany. “My responsibility on that mission was to release bundles of aluminum foil from the plane to deflect radar to keep anyone from spotting us. In other missions, I was a turret gunner.”

 A turret is a revolving armored structure in aircraft that houses one or more guns and can be rotated to aim the weapons in different directions. The operator is often in a cramped, dangerous position. Jones stood 5 feet, 8 inches and weighed 137 pounds.
Jones’ combat missions were over Germany, Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia.  Memories of enemy flak aimed at his plane will not be forgotten.
Was he ever scared?
“Fear is one of the most powerful emotional responses,” he said. “I just did my job but the fear was there. I always felt I was going to come back home.”
The first 100 runs of the 455th Bombardment Group were the most dangerous, Jones said. “About 75% of them were never completed.”
 A commendation for Jones’ bravery in the skies over Europe.
On May 8, 1945, after 35 combat missions, Jones was sent to Naples, Italy. On May 25, he landed in Florida and was assigned to a parts division. 
On Oct. 20, 1945, Jones got his discharge papers as a staff sergeant. He rode a bus from Florida to Lexington. He then caught a bus service that put him about five miles from his Lost Creek home.  
Jones arrived on foot and unannounced. “I can’t tell you the minute-by-minute reunion with my family but I know there were a lot of smiles.”
Sanford Jones was back home. The world was trying to heal after a horrific war, and he found Lost Creek was still an isolated place.
Beyond Lost Creek

“It was a little bit awkward at first being home. It was different from the military world I left. I wanted to do something with myself and I knew that education was the way,” said Jones.
He secured his high school diploma from Robinson High School in Perry County.  He then successfully applied to the Eastern Kentucky State College (now Eastern Kentucky University) under the federal GI bill and earned a science degree.
At the University of Kentucky, he not only got a master’s degree in science but met the love of his life.
“At UK’s Student Center one day in the summer of 1954, I saw a group square dancing. I don’t think they do much of that today at UK. I saw a certain girl. I liked what I saw. I introduced myself and she started looking at me. I asked her to dance. We did. I then thought I would never see her again. So I asked her out for a date the next night. She was working on her master’s in elementary education. She accepted.”
On Aug. 18, 1956, Sanford Jones and June Elizabeth Daugherty of Louisville were married at Crescent Hill Methodist Church in Louisville. She had been teaching the last six years at Brandeis Elementary School in Louisville.

After he finished his doctorate at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, the couple moved to Richmond in 1961 where he became a professor at Eastern Kentucky University. For 13 years, he served as chair of the school’s Department of Biological Sciences. He retired June 30, 1992. 
They have three children: Sanford Logan Jones Jr., a psychiatrist in Cincinnati; Henry Mason Jones, a teleradiologist in Rancho Mirage, Calif., and Catherine Elizabeth Jones, an architect in Manhattan in New York City.
Sanford’s wife died March 23, 2019. She was almost 91. Besides raising a family, she taught a Sunday school class at a local Methodist church and was active in the League of Women Voters.
“She had a bad fall and fracture. We had about 63 years together. I appreciate all of them,” said Jones. 
During their marriage, they visited the island of Capri in Italy, known for its picturesque scenery. That’s where young Jones was stationed for “rest and relaxation” breaks from his combat missions in World War II a world ago.
He says today his life has been “one of wonderful connections.”
In recent years, his namesake son has taken him to World War II museums and reunions. Earlier this year, he was invited to be a panelist at the grand National WWII museum in New Orleans with two other veterans to share stories that highlighted the bravery and humility of veterans in the global conflict that ended 80 years ago.
“I couldn’t turn that down, though I was a little nervous,” he said.

Most Mexicans who call Imperial home hail from the northern state of Chihuahua, where the band is also from. (Bob Alberts/Flatwater Free Press)IMPERIAL, Nebraska — In a dusty show barn, kids march out their prize-winning swine as an auctioneer sings out competing bids.
Outside, shrieks pierce this hot August night as families spin in loops on lit-up carnival rides. Vendors sell giant chocolate ice creams and funnel cakes, corn dogs and lemonades.
Every year, the Chase County Fair & Expo draws 10,000 people to this county of 3,764. They come for the classic small-town rite of summer. And they come for the fair’s annual concerts.
This year, the county fair did something new. For the first time, fair organizers hired a Mexican band to perform, figuring that made practical sense in a community whose Latino population has grown sixfold since 2000. The announcement brought buzz and excitement on social media.
But in the hours leading up to the Thursday night concert, only 300 tickets had sold, low for the grandstand that can hold 3,500. Many local Latino residents had decided to stay home, afraid of what could happen.

“The rumor was that this was bait,” Imperial resident Cynthia Almanza said while waiting for the concert to start. “That ICE was going to show up.”
The local rumor mill also alleged that the county sheriff had been the one to make that call.
Versions of this story burned through Imperial and surrounding towns this summer, Almanza and other residents told the Flatwater Free Press.
The Chase County sheriff was upset the fair had booked a Mexican band, residents said. He had called the feds, they said. They even said the fair had planned the concert as a trap. The suspicion grew so strong that one Imperial police officer went so far as to ask Immigration and Customs Enforcement: Did the sheriff contact you?
Chase County Sheriff Kevin Mueller said in an emailed statement it was a “false and harmful rumor” that he “made a racist comment” during a fair board meeting discussing security needs for the concert.
But it was true that he called ICE, he said in an email Thursday evening.
“I did place a call to ICE,” Mueller wrote. “About a week later, someone returned my call … by that time, I had already determined that we had sufficient security in place through the Fair Board and the State Patrol.”
The idea that ICE agents could show up at the fair took root in people’s minds. Almanza had friends who skipped the show. “It terrified lots of people,” she said.
“It made me question if I should even be here,” said Judith Beltran, another concertgoer, who heard the story of the potential ICE raid shortly after arriving for the concert from Denver. “Just because of the chaos … I don’t want to be in the middle of it.”
In the eight months of immigration crackdowns under the Trump administration, fear of ICE raids has penetrated many aspects of immigrant life in Nebraska. Rumors of raids and government vehicle sightings flood Facebook groups and WhatsApp chats.
Some families are retreating from public life, including some who have legal status, advocates say. It’s keeping kids from attending school, they say, and parents from going to work.
In Imperial, it left some wondering: Is the county fair safe?
A Latino band
The Chase County Fair Board approached Rodolfo Aragon in April with a question: Would he join the committee to help book a Latino band? The board was trying to make the annual event more inclusive, Aragon said, and wanted “to thank people for being a part of the community.”

In 2000, only 5% of Imperial’s residents were Latino, according to census data. Now, nearly a third of the city’s residents are.
“The whole community has really shifted in the last two to three decades,” said Tyler Pribbeno, an Imperial native and the city administrator. “Imperial has sustained its population … we would have been much smaller, probably the size of Grant, if we didn’t have all these people coming in and choosing to live and work and play here.”
The fair board first suggested a smaller act to draw this ever-growing Latino crowd, maybe a show that didn’t play at the main grandstand, maybe a local band.
But the newly recruited Aragon and the concert committee wanted to go bigger. After all, Johnny Cash played the Chase County Fair. So did Alice Cooper.
“We didn’t want the Hispanic pick to be any different,” Aragon said. “Let’s pick someone from Chihuahua, everyone’s going to be drawn to that.”
In May, they hit what they thought was the Mexican music jackpot, hiring La Fiera de Ojinaga, an accordion-driven norteño band from northern Mexico with more than 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify and hundreds of millions of streams.
Then, Aragon started hearing a rumor. White residents were telling their Latino friends: You might not want to be at that concert. People in the country legally worried about attending, scared that they could get detained because of the color of their skin, Aragon said.

The most out-there version of the rumor he heard: That the fair board had planned the concert as a trap.
“We can’t control fear. We can only control what we can control,” said Ryan Stromberger, president of the fair board. “It’s unfortunate that they felt that way, I don’t know how we can control that, though … Obviously we had no ill intentions, otherwise we wouldn’t have booked it.”
Rumors roll
Much of this fear appeared to stem from the May fair board meeting, when the board convened weeks before fair leaders planned to announce the last-minute concert addition.
City police and the Sheriff’s Office attended to discuss concert security. They appeared to single out the Mexican concert as a specific worry.
The law enforcement officers “voiced concerns about disturbances during Thursday’s night concert,” meeting minutes read. “They want to know about security precautions for concert nights.”
The discussion lasted about 20 minutes, according to meeting minutes. There is no audio recording of that meeting. Fair board members deferred questions to Stromberger, who said discussion focused mostly on whether law enforcement agencies had the budget and manpower to accommodate an extra concert night.
But that discussion continued among law enforcement officers outside the meeting room, said Chris Bustillos, the Imperial police sergeant. After that meeting, the rumors started to spiral, several Imperial residents said in interviews.
Mueller, the county sheriff, said in an email that any rumors that he “made a racist comment during a fair board meeting” were false.
“We had concerns that an extra night would place additional strain on our resources,” he wrote. “Apparently, one member took offense to my comments and began spreading a false and harmful rumor about me … this allegation is baseless, damaging, and driven by personal agendas — not facts.”
Bustillos said he decided to fact-check the rumors himself.
“I believe our sheriff for Chase County contacted someone either in your office or on the hotline about a Hispanic concert we will be having for our Chase County Expo Fair,” he wrote to the North Platte ICE office in an email obtained by the Flatwater Free Press through a records request. “I was just hoping to find out if that is something you or anyone in the ICE office will be attending? Again, I was just informed our sheriff contacted you. I have no idea if he really did or if that’s something you do.”
Replying via email, a Department of Homeland Security agent replied that the office had “received a call regarding the concerts.”
Bustillos said he and the DHS agent then spoke by phone. The agent told him that yes, the Sheriff’s Office had contacted the ICE office, Bustillos said in an interview. No, the ICE agents weren’t planning to come to the fair.
Mueller didn’t return a phone call Thursday seeking additional comment. Instead, he had a Sheriff’s Office employee send the Flatwater Free Press his emailed statement. He had previously not returned two other phone calls and an email seeking comment, instead communicating via another emailed statement.
Calling ICE had “nothing to do with the false allegation that I made racist comments,” Mueller wrote. “My focus throughout has been solely on ensuring the safety and security of the fair, nothing more.”
An ICE spokesperson declined to discuss any interaction with the sheriff.
“Pushing something out about ICE speaking to a sheriff or other law enforcement officers, with whom we partner with on a daily basis, will do nothing but fear monger,” spokesperson Tanya Roman wrote in an email. “There is no reason why anyone not breaking the law should have any concerns about one law enforcement agency speaking to another.”
Knowing your rights
On a Sunday afternoon two weeks before the fair, about 20 people gathered in an Imperial United Methodist Church sanctuary. The day’s lecture: Knowing your rights if stopped by ICE.
After hearing the fair rumors, Jo Leyland felt moved to act. The retired city administrator started calling nonprofits, hoping to get a pamphlet she could hand out to people about immigration rights. Instead, staff members from Nebraska Appleseed, a nonprofit that advocates for immigrant rights, offered to make the nearly four-hour drive from Lincoln to Imperial.
“I wanted to educate people, both with brown and white faces, about what could be done if the worst thing happened and ICE did show up,” Leyland said.
After the presentation at the church, Leyland took Know Your Rights cards from an Appleseed rep to pass out at the fair. The city took pamphlets to keep at the library and city offices. By the end of the session, all the paper handouts had been taken.
Appleseed has held worker’s rights safety trainings for years, said Ruby Méndez López, a community organizer with the nonprofit. But since January, the nonprofit has held about 20 Know Your Rights meetings across the state, educating immigrants and Americans on what they can and can’t do during a crackdown.
People are desperate for this information, Méndez López said, and grateful to get it. But getting people to attend Know Your Rights sessions can be a challenge.
“If we publicly post Know Your Rights information, people get really nervous about showing up,” Méndez López said. “People start to think it’s a trap put on by whoever is planning it.”
At the Imperial meeting, most of the attendees were white. Méndez López tried to set up a smaller Know Your Rights session with migrant workers in town. People were too scared to come, she said. The fear of going out in public has come and gone in waves through 2025, Méndez López said.
It was strong at the start of the year, when President Donald Trump took office. It peaked again after the immigration raid at Glenn Valley in Omaha, when ICE detained about 75 people. In the aftermath, rumors of potential ICE raids in towns like Lexington and Grand Island flooded social media. No other large raid has yet happened.
“People were just not showing up to work,” Méndez López said. “When there’s rumors that are unverified, it disrupts people’s lives entirely … it’s hard to know what to believe.”
How it went
On Thursday night at the fair, excitement over the concert mixed with unease and uncertainty. At a large booth on the midway, young members of the Lions Club shouted out bingo numbers — in English and Spanish.

Further down the midway, a cutout of Donald and Melania Trump advertised a booth selling MAGA hats and T-shirts, thermoses proclaiming “Don’t Tread on Me” and “I voted for the felon.”
No immigration authorities showed up that night. And fewer concertgoers than usual showed up, too — roughly 500 people ended up buying tickets to see La Fiera de Ojinaga, Stromberger said, far fewer than the combined 6,000 attendees at the Friday and Saturday country acts.
But the hundreds of mostly Latino fans who did attend came dressed in their best cowboy hats, jeans and boots. Some, like Almanza, never thought they would see a day when one of their favorite Mexican bands played their small-town American fair.
As the band played, couples paired off and whirled their way around the empty back half of the venue, stepping in time with the band’s bouncy drumbeat in the glowing light of the stage. The notes of an accordion and saxophone rang out into the crowd.
And when the band shouted out their home state of Chihuahua, whoops and cheers erupted from the crowd.
Behind the crowd, a lit-up Ferris wheel looped kids into the sky. Vendors handed out cotton candy and fried Oreos. For a moment, it felt like another night at the fair.

(Getty Images)I often think of the Knights of Labor, but especially on Labor Day.
I’m a retiree member of the American Federation of Teachers who taught history at West Kentucky Community and Technical College in Paducah for two dozen years.
The Knights are gone and largely forgotten. Yet they were 19th century America’s largest labor organization and an ancestor of the AFL-CIO.
Founded in 1869 in Philadelphia, the Knights “tried to teach the American wage-earner that he was a wage-earner first and a bricklayer, carpenter, miner, shoemaker, after; that he was a wage-earner first and a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, white, black, Democrat, Republican, after,” historian Norman J. Ware wrote in “The Labor Movement in the United States 1860-1895: A Study in Democracy.” I’d add “teacher” to the list of jobs.
“The Knights operated as both a trade union federation and a political movement,” wrote historian Jonathan Garlock. “Envisioning a ‘Cooperative Commonwealth’ in which producer cooperatives and nationalized railroads would replace monopolistic capitalism, the Knights launched dozens of local and state labor parties and hundreds of worker-owned cooperatives.”
Knights belonged to Local Assemblies which numbered in the thousands. Each assembly “represented members in their work places, bargaining with employers, threatening and conducting strikes,” Garlock added. “Inclusivity was the other hallmark of the KOL (especially in comparison to the American Federation of Labor unions that followed). The Knights included African American workers and counted 246 local assemblies organized by women workers.”
The main goal of the Knights and other 19th century unions was the eight-hour workday. They also called for the abolition of child labor. But the Knights argued that men and women who did the same job should get the same pay.
The Knights’ motto was, “That is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all.” The union peaked at almost a million members in the late 1880s, before fading away and all but disappearing by the turn of the 20th century.
The union spread nationwide, and even worldwide, with Local Assemblies in Canada, Great Britain and Australia. According to The Kentucky Encyclopedia, 177 assemblies operated in Kentucky — in Louisville, Covington Lexington, Frankfort and even in small towns like Fulton. I treasure a copy of The Toiler, the Fulton Knights’ newspaper.
On Nov. 25, 1894, Lexington area Knights celebrated their union’s 25th birthday at the Opera House, enjoying “a gratifying success in every feature,” according to the Kentucky Leader of Nov. 26. (A ball followed at Jackson Hall with Saxton’s Band providing the dance music.)
Success was often elusive for unions as the country rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. Well-heeled capitalists helped whip up anti-labor hysteria by demonizing unions as “un-Christian” and “un-American,” even communist.
Most employers, notably in industry, stubbornly, even violently, resisted unions, with help from friendly local and state officials. Judges routinely issued injunctions to stop strikes. Police, sheriff’s deputies and even National Guard troops were almost always available for strikebreaking duty.
Union-busting was bipartisan. Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes dispatched federal troops to break the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, sent U.S. soldiers to crush the Pullman Strike in 1894.
To protect its members against getting fired by anti-union bosses, the Knights had started as a secret organization. The Knights dropped its veil of secrecy in 1879 and deleted “Noble and Holy Order” from its original name.
Afterwards, the union enjoyed rapid growth.
Featured speakers at the 25th birthday celebration included local Democratic Congressman W.C.P. Breckinridge, a Confederate veteran, and Dr. W.T. Bolling, a Lexington pastor.
Breckinridge acknowledged that the federal government had the power to abolish child labor, outlaw the company store system and pass laws to make workplaces sanitary. But he rebuked those who looked to federal “legislation as the great panacea or cure all of the nineteenth century,” the Lexington paper said.
Bolling advised workers that if they would “be true, be patient, honest and diligent” and vote “the time will come when the host of labor may sing as sung Israel when freed from the bondage of Egypt.”
The Leader didn’t report the Knights’ reaction to the politician or the pastor. But based on the preamble to the union’s 1878 “Declaration of Principles” they might have been disappointed. The preamble warned that “the alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will invariably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.”
Thus, it was “imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth. This much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction, ‘In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.’”
A footnote: Not everybody was welcome to join the Knights, explained a Nov. 25 Leader story about the upcoming anniversary observance. The banned list included “stock-holders, bankers, lawyers, professional gamblers, and those who, in any way, derive their living from the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors.”

(Photo courtesy of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, Miami Field Office)More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.
The New Hampshire legislature passed two anti-sanctuary bills earlier this year that, with Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s signature, became law and go into effect in January. Republican lawmakers have tried repeatedly since 2006 to pass legislature that would prohibit “sanctuary city” policies. This year they were finally able to get enough Democratic votes in the House, with Democratic lawmakers saying the amended version lessened its impact and was preferable to a stricter alternative.

Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

(Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Youngkin touts Va.’s $4.7 billion cash cushion, downplays Medicaid, federal workforce changes

Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
Federal cuts hit coastal flooding, dam projects

“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
Virginia housing nonprofits and residents are monitoring federal cuts, fraying state safety nets

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.
In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

During the 2024 election campaign, the Republican Party’s historically fraught relationship with organized labor appeared to be changing. Several influential Republicans reached out to unions, seeking to cement the loyalties of the growing ranks of working-class Americans who have been backing Donald Trump’s presidential runs and voting for other members of his party.
During Trump’s first bid for the White house, the percentage of votes in households where at least one person belongs to a union fell to its lowest level in decades. In 2021, Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator at the time, wrote a USA Today op-ed supporting a unionization drive at an Amazon facility. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, walked a United Auto Workers picket line in 2023 in solidarity with striking workers.
As the 2024 GOP presidential nominee, Trump spotlighted International Brotherhood of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien with a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention – rewarding the union for staying neutral in that campaign after endorsing Joe Biden four years earlier.
Yet O’Brien shocked many in the convention crowd by lambasting longtime GOP coalition partners such as the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable for hurting American workers.
Once in office, Trump continued to signal some degree of solidarity with the blue-collar voters who backed him. He chose former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Teamsters ally, to be his second-term labor secretary.
I’m a sociologist who has been researching the U.S. labor movement for over two decades. Given conservatives’ long-standing antipathy toward unions, I was curious whether the GOP’s greater engagement with labor portended any kind of change in its policies.
Fumbled at the starting line
The GOP’s various outreach efforts during the 2024 campaign led University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, a scholar of declining labor power, to write, “Is a pro-labor Republican Party possible?”
More than six months into Trump’s second term, I would say that based on the evidence thus far the answer to Posner’s question is a resounding no.
In late March 2025, Trump issued an executive order stripping hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their collective bargaining rights.
Overnight, twice as many federal employees lost their union protections as there are members of the United Auto Workers union, making the action “the largest and most aggressive single act of union-busting in U.S. history,” according to Georgetown University labor historian Joseph McCartin.
While affected unions have challenged that action and similar subsequent ones in court, the Trump administration is moving onto other agencies. In August, over 400,000 federal employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs and Environmental Protection Agency saw their union contracts terminated and their collective bargaining rights dissolved.
Everett Kelley, the American Federation of Government Employees president, described the attacks on federal workers as a “setback for fundamental rights in America.”
Tariffs, other policies aren’t helping
The Trump administration has pitched its erratic tariff policies as a boon to U.S.manufacturing, including in the automotive industry, once the foundation of the U.S. labor movement.

In reality, U.S. car producers are struggling to keep up with rising tariff-related costs of raw materials and parts. The number of factory jobs has fallen to the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, a supporter of targeted tariffs to buttress the domestic auto industry, criticized the administration’s trade policy in April 2025, saying, “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”
Other administration actions cast as relief for struggling workers are unlikely to deliver as advertised. The “no tax on tips” provision in Trump’s huge tax-and-spending package excludes the nearly 40% of tipped workers whose earnings fall below the federal income tax threshold. Tipped workers make up a tiny share of the low-wage workforce.
Culinary Workers Local 226, a powerful Nevada union representing many tipped workers in Las Vegas and Reno, supported the provision. Yet it blasted the overall package, calling it a “big, horrible bill” for its windfalls to the rich instead of the working class.
Removing the watchdogs
The National Labor Relations Board is responsible for ensuring management and labor adhere to provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. Passed in 1935, that law established workers’ fundamental rights to collective bargaining. The board is responsible for conducting union elections, investigating allegations of unfair labor practices and outright abuses by employers, and enforcing court orders when employers or unions are found to have broken labor laws.
Presidents regularly use vacancies to tilt the ideological balance of the board to a more or less labor-friendly position. Trump, however, went further.
Soon after he was sworn in for a second term, Trump fired the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel along with board member Gwynne Wilcox, who was only halfway through her five-year term. Wilcox’s dismissal was unprecedented and violated the National Labor Relations Act provision on board personnel changes.
Wilcox’s removal left the body without a quorum, preventing it from responding to appeals or requests for review and allowing employers accused of violating workers’ rights to delay any settlement. The Trump administration has left those important NLRB jobs vacant for months, although it has nominated two management-friendly replacements, both of whom awaited Senate approval in mid-August.
In the meantime, the agency is unable to hear labor disputes.
Disempowering the NLRB is a long-standing Republican tactic, suggesting more continuity with past GOP attacks on labor than a new era of partnership.
Hawley standing out
To be sure, Republicans don’t all agree with one another on the importance of supporting workers and labor rights. One who has stood out so far is Hawley. The relatively pro-labor Republican senator’s stance led him to partner with Sen. Corey Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to co-sponsor the Faster Labor Contracts Act.
This new bill would force employers to negotiate a contract in a reasonable time frame with employees once they have voted in favor of forming a union.
Hawley also joined with Democrats to reintroduce a bill that would ban dangerous work speed requirements in warehouses. Hawley said, when summarizing his efforts on behalf of working people, “It’s time we deliver for them.”
The Missouri senator is not completely alone. Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Roger Marshall of Kansas, both Republicans, have backed some labor-friendly legislation in the spring and summer of this year.
GOP leaders in Congress are not moving those bills forward so far, likely in part due to pushback from Republicans and their allies outside Congress.
And there are limits to Hawley’s labor friendliness. He voted for Trump’s tax-and-spending package, despite publicly airing his misgivings about the harm it may cause his blue-collar constituents.
Meanwhile, his past partners in the more labor-friendly wing of the GOP now occupy prominent administration posts. Yet they have largely fallen silent on union issues — except, in Rubio’s case, to oversee the firing of well over 1,000 State Department employees, many of them members of the American Foreign Service Association union.
Trump labor approach echoes Reagan’s style
Another GOP presidential administration courted segments of the labor movement to divide a key Democratic constituency, only to take actions that weakened unions.
In 1980, for example, Ronald Reagan sought and won the endorsement of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. A year later, he fired 13,000 striking members of that union.
The Teamsters union also backed Reagan – twice. It endorsed him in 1980 after he pledged during the 1980 campaign not to pursue anti-labor policies. Although he broke his promise, personal outreach from Vice President George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the 1984 election earned him the Teamsters endorsement a second time.
What seems clear in my view is that whenever the GOP has tried to cast itself as a labor-friendly political party, it has emphasized symbolism over substance, favoring using rhetoric embracing workers who belong to unions versus taking actions to strengthen labor rights.

(Getty photos)In March: a 25% tariff imposed by the U.S on Canadian steel and aluminum. Soon after: a host of retaliatory tariffs passed by Canada against American goods. And then, in late August, a new pledge by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to remove most — but not all — of those counter-tariffs by Sept. 1.
The trade policies between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have careened in recent months, sending businesses into uncertainty as President Donald Trump pushes through aggressive and evolving negotiating tactics.
In New Hampshire, they appear to be having an impact. By June 2025, exports to Canada for the year were 42.6% lower than at the same point in 2024, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Foreign Trade Bureau.
But this fall, lawmakers and state officials are hoping to push past the chaos and make a simple pitch: The Granite State is still open for business.
Over multiple days in early September, New Hampshire leaders will carry out a trade mission with Canadian and American businesses to try to strengthen cross border ties. The efforts will culminate in Quebec City, when Gov. Kelly Ayotte will participate in what has been billed as an “intimate reception” for politicians and business leaders at a Hilton hotel.
Plans for the trade mission, which are still under development, include a Sept. 8 bus tour to Nova Scotia — by way of Littleton — with business leaders from both countries, according to Sen. Tim McGough, a Merrimack Republican and the chairman of the New Hampshire Canadian Trade Council. That will be followed by a journey to Quebec ahead of the event with the governor,
“We’re pretty happy to have a good contingent of significant business leaders joining us on the bus,” said McGough during a council meeting Monday.
“They’re a captive audience,” he added, speaking of the Canadian business representatives. “And they’re looking forward to the captive audience too.”

The effort comes as New Hampshire’s economy has shown signs it has been affected by the trade war between Washington and Ottawa.
Canada is still New Hampshire’s No. 2 export country, bolstered in large part by sales of aircraft and spacecraft parts from companies such as Marmon Aerospace & Defense and GE Aviation. The state also sends machinery and fabricated metal products, according to a 2019 fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Commerce. But while in the full 2024 calendar year, the Granite State sent $1.2 billion worth of products over the northern border, it had only sent about $400 million by June of this year.
In contrast, exports to New Hampshire’s leading export country, Germany, were 3.2% higher in June 2025 than in June 2024. And exports to Mexico, the state’s third highest importer, were up 14.9% in June.
Overall, New Hampshire’s exports to all countries, which totaled $7.1 billion in all of 2024, were down 4.19% in June.
 Uncertain times

The state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs is watching those numbers.
The department cannot be certain the drop in exports to Canada was caused by the tariffs; it could be supply chain changes that are unrelated, said Adam Boltik, program manager of the department’s Office of International Commerce.
“But with something like a 40% drop, that does make you look,” he said in an interview.
To help businesses keep up with the changing conditions, the BEA has regularly posted the latest tariffs on a page on its website. But Boltik said companies must make their own decisions over what to do with that information.
“We are here to be a resource,” he said. That can mean helping businesses affected by the tariffs to find “mitigating measures” such as alternative sources for their materials. The department can also help companies look for new markets to sell their products if the Canadian tariffs are hurting their business, he said.
The department is limited in what it knows. While some top line economic figures exist, much of the BEA’s understanding comes from anecdotes. “When companies will come to me and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got this coming in from Country X and all of a sudden, there’s a tariff on it. What happens?’” In many cases, there is no way to collect the aggregate data needed to better understand those anecdotes, he added.
Carney’s announcement that Canada would be lifting many of its retaliatory tariffs is good news for many New Hampshire businesses, Boltik said. Still, there is a new worry. On Friday, Trump’s executive order ending the “de minimus” tariff exception for U.S. imports will take effect. That change will mean that goods coming into the U.S. worth $800 or less, which were previously exempt from tariffs, will suddenly be subject to the taxes.
That, Boltik fears, could lead Canada to retaliate by imposing tariffs on small-dollar imports from the U.S. as well.
“There may be enough of an outcry from those Canadian producers and small businesses that Canada does something,” he said.
 An enduring relationship

René Sylvestre, Québec’s delegate to New England, is optimistic the longstanding ties between the two geographic reasons can survive the tumult.
“Our economies are so intertwined that we’re still looking to do business and work with companies and folk in New England,” he said in an interview.
Despite the tariffs, Sylvestre said he hasn’t seen major changes in operations by Québécois companies, partly because the supply chains are so established. That includes aerospace companies.
One source of that optimism: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, passed during the first Trump term as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement protects a swath of products from tariffs, including agriculture, automobile products, textiles, machinery, and digital products.
“Pretty much most of our products are under the USMCA,” Sylvestre said.
That agreement did not stop the Trump administration from adding 25% tariffs to automobiles, steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, which the White House has said is allowed by security exceptions.
Sylvestre said trade missions such as the one in September are intended to reassure businesses.And the idea has precedent: In April, soon after the tariff standoff kicked off, a delegation of Canadian businesses visited Portsmouth for a similar trade mission.
 Tourism decline

If businesses are staying the course, tourism is a different story. The number of tourists visiting New Hampshire from Canada has dropped around 30% this year, BEA Commissioner Taylor Caswell said earlier this month.
Animosity toward the United States, in addition to economic anxieties and fears about having trouble at the U.S. border have helped to contribute to the drop in tourism, Sylvestre said.
Before the trade war, there was “a kind of unconditional trust and love” between the countries,” he said. Now, feelings are unsettled.
“It’s really a perfect storm,” he said.
During Monday’s meeting, some said they have seen the effect of the drop in tourism. Janet Wall, a Madbury Democrat, noted that the Seacoast usually sees a late-summer burst of tourism from Canadians. This year, she said, beachside parking lots are not full, and business owners say there has been a “huge decline” in Canadian visitors.
McGough had a different take. Browsing the parking lots of the Merrimack Outlets this year, he has seen plenty of Québec license plates, he said.
The dip in tourism comes after New Hampshire and Canada were only just rebounding from the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the land border between the two countries was largely closed. In February 2024, Canadian Consul General for New England Bernadette Jordan paid a visit to the New Hampshire House to tout that turnaround.
“Whether it’s tourism, whether it’s trade, whether it’s people visiting families: We can’t impede that,” Jordan said in an interview with the Bulletin then. “But we still have to make sure that what we’re doing is still working. It does seem to be working.”
Today, under very different circumstances, Slyvestre hopes that that relationship will endure.
“I see this as one corridor,” he said. “Even though it’s two countries, there are so many things that we’re doing together.”

(Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read. 


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as 'The Job Chick' on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

There are two major narratives floating around. The “techno-optimist” view is that AI will free humans from boring tasks and create new jobs, while the “techno-pessimist” view is that AI will lead to widespread unemployment.
As a sociologist who studies job insecurity, I’m among the pessimists. And that’s not just because of AI itself. It’s about something deeper – what scholars call “American exceptionalism.” While people commonly use this phrase to refer to anything that makes the U.S. unique, I use it narrowly to refer to the country’s approach to work and social welfare, which is quite different from the systems in other rich countries.
I suspect AI will “turbocharge” American exceptionalism in ways that make workers more afraid of losing their jobs. When fused with organizations’ adoption of new types of AI, workers’ fears may soon become reality, if they haven’t already.
 An ‘exceptional’ system for American workers

Let’s start with what makes the U.S. different, especially from other rich countries.
The U.S. has relatively low levels of unionization, an “at-will” employment system, a modest welfare state, and a two-party system that lacks a social democratic tradition. Many wealthy countries boast higher unionization rates, stricter protections against being fired, and – particularly in Europe – more robust welfare states.
In other words, even before AI came into the picture, American workers were facing a system stacked against them.
This tendency grew more pronounced starting in the late 1970s, with Democrats and Republicans alike pursuing reforms such as stripping regulations and rolling back the welfare state. Between 1983 and 2022, unionization rates fell by more than 50%; they remain low today. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton pledged to “end welfare as we know it” and followed with a law slashing support programs. Meanwhile, U.S. workers’ inflation-adjusted wages have stagnated and income inequality has risen since the 1970s.
The current Trump administration has taken these “exceptional” traits even further. From firing the head of the National Labor Relations Board to his executive order undermining federal employee unions, Trump has usurped the power of regulatory agencies and workers themselves. And more cuts to the welfare state are coming now that Trump’s domestic policy bill has been signed into law, including reductions in food aid and health insurance.
One telling example is the Trump administration’s mass firing of federal workers. While they are making their way through the courts, these efforts are notable for targeting government positions that have long been thought to be the most secure jobs.
As a sociologist, I think it’s fair to say that the U.S. is even more “exceptional” than it was just a year ago. This trend lays the foundation for U.S. workers to fear losing their jobs, for employers to cut workers loose, and for people to struggle making ends meet.
 American exceptionalism, meet AI

To understand what’s happening, it helps to look at the different kinds of artificial intelligence, which generally refers to machines such as computers that can perform tasks comparably to humans.
One type is predictive AI, which is what powers your streaming and social media recommendations. The second type is generative AI, which is used to create seemingly novel content. ChatGPT and other large language models fall in this category. The third type, agentic AI, cannot only predict and plan outcomes but also can act autonomously to achieve those outcomes. Self-driving cars are perhaps the most well-known example.
Companies are increasingly using generative AI to boost productivity. According to Stanford University’s 2025 AI index report, generative AI has already surpassed human performance on a range of tasks, including visual reasoning and answering competition-level math and Ph.D.-level science questions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has warned that generative AI will affect jobs across a range of industries.
I think agentic AI will have dramatic implications for the workforce. Companies are already beginning to use it for customer service in industries from finance to travel. As if on cue, OpenAI recently released ChatGPT agent, which it says can handle “complex tasks from start to finish.”
When you combine technological advancements – such as the current transition to generative AI and the likely broader agentic AI transition – with turbocharged American exceptionalism, you get a formula for job insecurity and displacement.
 How AI might affect the future of job security

Interestingly, despite having fewer protections from firing and a more threadbare unemployment system, American workers are no more afraid of losing their jobs than workers in other rich countries, research shows. These perceptions are generally constant over time, but they spike as a result of certain economic reforms and during recessions.
Among the findings in my own research on free-market-driven economic reforms in Europe, people were most worried about losing their jobs in countries that had ratcheted up such policies within the past five years. That trend has important implications for the United States.
Recent polling shows that about a third of U.S. workers believe AI will hurt their jobs or job opportunities. Business leaders say they expect job losses in the service industries, supply chain management and human resources over the next three years.
There’s no shortage of predictions about AI-driven job gains and losses, but solid data is hard to come by – and don’t even bother asking most companies about AI-related layoffs.
On one hand, business leaders surveyed by McKinsey in 2024 reported high demand for new jobs such as “AI compliance specialist” and “AI ethics specialist,” which are the kinds of new roles that techno-optimists say will be created by AI.
On the other hand, it’s no small irony that AI was reportedly used to facilitate the mass firing of federal workers and may soon replace some Department of Education workers’ jobs.
America’s fusion of limited labor protections and aggressive AI adoption could create the perfect storm for widespread job insecurity. While unions have organized for AI-related job protections, and states are attempting to regulate AI, the U.S.’s path realistically depends less on workers’ and local politicians’ actions than what companies do. And I think companies’ increasing integration of AI will likely hurt American workers more than it helps.

Taylor Sisk for KFF Health NewsRebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan’s capital city that she never would have expected.
“It’s a very weird time in our lives,” said Kasen, executive director of the Women’s Center of Greater Lansing.
Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women’s Center staff reported being harassed.
A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by “First Amendment auditors” outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.
In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.
Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward “an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions.”
Researchers at American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, “hate is intersectional.” (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL’s director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of “A Minecraft Movie” prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.
The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.
The team defines extremism as the belief that one’s group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.
Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they’re on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)
Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s deputy director of prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that’s rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?
They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip “all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism” and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.
“We’re not about, ‘How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?’” Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL’s deputy director of regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. “Rather, ‘How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?’”
Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.
The state’s capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.
Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer’s covid lockdown directives.
Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about “how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible.”
The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and “Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry.”
Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.
The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.
Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She’s a proponent of the public health approach. It’s “providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward,” she said. It’s a way to channel energy “and feel like you can actually create change with community.”
Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.
In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” at an American Legion post.
In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book “They She He Me: Free to Be!” Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.
“It’s really important that rural communities not be left behind,” Flanagan said. “They persistently are in America, and then they’re often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges.”
The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children’s Hospital’s Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City’s Citizens Crime Commission.
And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.
Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism’s having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. “It’s just devastating,” he said. “It’s really startling.”
Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, “I would say now it has been completely shattered.” Violent extremists now feel “unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back.”
“We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime,” Simi said.
The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people’s lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.
“If you have a germ out there,” Whitaker said, “and people aren’t aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it’s an actual problem, you won’t enact basic protective behavior.”

In light of an opinion issued Tuesday by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, the American Civil Liberties Union said that eight Ohio counties don’t have legal contracts with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. That being the case, the ACLU of Ohio said, those detainees must be released.
However, one Ohio sheriff’s office said its contract with the feds meets the legal standards Yost laid out. Another said he’ll fix any problems, but he’s not releasing anybody.
For its part, Yost’s office declined to answer questions.
After taking office in January, President Donald Trump swiftly began implementing his policy of mass deportation. It was sold on promises that he would throw out violent criminals, but only 7% of those deported have been convicted of violent crimes.
Meanwhile, stories are accumulating of dodgy cases against beloved asylum seekers. Claims of human rights abuses are mounting. And some economists predict that removing so many from the workforce will make already-high inflation even worse.
Once a strong issue for Trump, by mid-July, just 35% of Americans approved of his handling of immigration, according to a Gallup Poll.
But regardless of the issue’s popularity, Ohio sheriffs have an incentive to take in ICE detainees. They get $125 per-person, per-day, while the feds cover most of their non-food expenses. That revenue has helped fill gaps in their budgets, one Ohio sheriff said.
In an opinion published Tuesday, Yost seemed to raise doubts about the legality of at least some of the arrangements. In response to a query from the Butler County Prosecutor’s Office, the attorney general said county jails could hold ICE detainees longer than 48 hours, and they could provide services such as transport — but only under contracts between the feds and the county commissioners.
“The board of county commissioners may enter into an agreement with federal immigration authorities, on behalf of the sheriff, to detain aliens subject to removal in the county jail,” the opinion said. “The sheriff, however, does not have independent contracting authority for this purpose.” 
At least two of the eight Ohio counties contracting to hold ICE detainees — Butler and Mahoning — are doing so after modifying contracts to hold prisoners on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service. The ACLU of Ohio on Wednesday said that wasn’t sufficient.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Attorney General Yost has made abundantly clear that all county agreements with ICE must be authorized by the board of county commissioners,” Freda Levenson, the group’s legal director, said in a written statement. “County sheriffs cannot bootstrap themselves into having this authority. Striking these agreements means there is no legal authority to hold the immigrants currently incarcerated in our county jails. The people detained under these invalid agreements are being held unconstitutionally and must be released immediately.” 
The attorney general’s office was asked if the ACLU was correct in saying that Yost’s ruling meant that hundreds of detainees were being held in Ohio illegally. It declined to answer.
“Your question is different than the specific question asked by the Butler County Prosecuting Attorney and we offer no answer in response — our office does not issue legal opinions or guidance to nonclients,” Steven Irwin, a spokesman, said in an email. “The opinion issued to the Butler County Prosecuting Attorney addressed a specific, narrow question on a positive power of government. We have nothing more to say at this time.”
The ACLU said eight county sheriffs offices had improper ICE agreements: Those in Butler, Fairfield, Fayette, Geauga, Lake, Portage, Mahoning and Seneca counties.
However, Butler County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Anthony E. Dwyer on Thursday said county commissioners there had signed off on his department’s arrangement with the feds. He sent along the commissioners’ resolution approving the modification of a contract to take in prisoners of the Marshals Service to also allow the jail to take ICE detainees. 
“We got that agreement signed off on by the county commissioners,” Dwyer said in an interview. “The ACLU is a little mistaken about what they’re saying about Butler County.”
He added, “People have regularly come to commissioners meetings and talked about it, so it’s shocking that they’re that far behind that they don’t know that.”
Butler County housed 303 ICE detainees on Thursday. Mahoning County Jail in Northeast Ohio houses around 100 on a normal day. 
Sheriff Jerry Greene was asked whether Yost’s opinion affected the legality of their detention.
“The answer is I don’t know at this point,” he said in an interview Thursday. “I’m not sure if the commissioners would be considered as officially parties to the contract. When we put it together, they were definitely in the know and we informed them every step of the way.”
As for the ACLU’s call to release the detainees, Greene was adamant.
“The answer is absolutely not,” he said. “I am doing this to support the federal government. We have housed federal inmates for years. We’re definitely going to make sure we’re constitutional and following the law… but I’m not releasing anybody. We’ll remedy it as soon as possible.”

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”
Conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ people, long discredited, could make a comeback

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

For years, anti-renewable-energy advocates have opposed solar and wind projects on the grounds that they take up too much land. Now those talking points, popularized by groups linked to the fossil-fuel industry, have made their way into a sweeping new directive from the Trump administration.


On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated that federal leasing decisions factor in ​“capacity density” for solar and wind projects.


His order defines ​“capacity density” as the amount of electricity a proposed facility is expected to produce, as a share of the maximum ​“nameplate” amount, divided by the site’s total acres. An appendix to the order shows that nuclear and combined-cycle gas plants rank highest on this measure, while renewables come in last.


The Interior Department will now have to consider the density measure in environmental reviews. With that in mind, the order questions whether the law allows any federal land use for wind and solar projects, ​“given these projects’ encumbrance on other land uses, as well as their disproportionate land use.”


Only a small portion of solar and wind projects are located on areas owned and managed by the U.S. government, but there is vast potential for development. A January 2025 report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that 1,300 gigawatts of solar and 60 GW of onshore wind could be cost-effectively built on public lands, and that significant deployment in those spaces would be needed to meet grid-decarbonization goals.


It’s unclear whether the order might also block some projects on private property if they require reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act.


The directive is yet another example of the Trump administration’s push to slow the development of solar and wind, which together with batteries will account for more than 90% of new utility-scale energy-capacity additions this year. But more broadly, it illustrates how the administration is elevating fossil-fuel-backed misinformation about land use into federal energy policy.


“This is the latest sign that the Trump administration is really just relying on political talking points to push back on renewable energy that have little or no basis in fact,” said Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that focuses on the fossil-fuel and utility industries.


 The density debate

Before ​“capacity density” became a factor in federal leasing decisions, anti-renewable-energy groups were using the argument to build local opposition to utility-scale clean-power projects across the country.


The battle over a now-approved solar project in central Ohio provides a case in point.


In November 2023, a group called Knox Smart Development held a town-hall meeting to stoke opposition to the proposed 120-megawatt Frasier agrivoltaics project.


Canary Media (then the Energy News Network) confirmed last year that one of the main funders of the group was Tom Rastin, former vice president of Ariel Corp., which makes compressors for the oil and gas industry. Rastin and his wife, Karen Buchwald Wright, who is the company’s board chair, also play large roles in The Empowerment Alliance, a pro-natural-gas group.


Steve Goreham, a policy advisor to conservative think tank The Heartland Institute, was one of the speakers at the 2023 event.


In addition to denying that climate change requires a shift away from fossil fuels, Goreham told people at the Knox County meeting that solar farms require much more land than nuclear, gas, and coal-fired power plants. He also focused on ​“power density” in a 2023 opinion piece for the conservative-leaning Western Journal, warning that ​“environmental devastation” will result from policies that aim to accomplish net-zero carbon emissions. Goreham repeated this land-use argument in a Real Clear Energy post in March.

A Heartland Institute policy brief released this spring also relied on information about the land areas needed for solar and wind energy to conclude that large-scale electricity production from those sources ​“requires substantial ecological damage and impact.” The institute’s funders have included Exxon Mobil, coal-mining company Murray Energy (now American Consolidated Natural Resources), and foundations supported by the Koch brothers.


Another speaker at Knox Smart Development’s town hall, a lobbyist named Mitch Given, had previously represented The Empowerment Alliance in a 2023 presentation to the Ohio legislature’s Business First Caucus. His slides on the ​“nonsense of turning corn fields into solar fields” compared 6,050 acres for an Ohio solar project to just 5 acres for a similar-sized combined-cycle gas power plant.


A 2024 rally against the Frasier agrivoltaics project then brought in Robert Bryce, a former Manhattan Institute fellow who spent an entire chapter of his 2010 book arguing that wind and solar energy are not green because of their land use and power density. The argument is also featured in an anti-solar video he released this month.


The Manhattan Institute has received funding from fossil-fuel interests, such as Exxon Mobil and organizations linked to the Koch brothers. The Checks and Balances Project, a pro-clean-energy watchdog group, has criticized Bryce multiple times for failing to disclose those links. Bryce did not respond to Canary Media’s request for comment for this story.


“Everybody needs to come to this debate with a full picture of who they’re talking to and why they’re saying what they’re saying,” said Ray Locker, executive director for the Checks and Balances Project. Companies in the fossil-fuel industry ​“have a vested interest in preserving their business,” so when they present renewable energy ​“as somehow dirty, then that furthers their interest.”


This month’s Interior Department order is not the only recent federal attack on clean energy based on the land-use argument. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that the agency’s longstanding Rural Energy for America Program would no longer fund large solar projects on ​“prime farmland,” a major shift for a program whose main use case has been helping farmers install solar energy.


 “An absurd metric”

Burgum’s order to the Department of the Interior is ​“really implementing an ideological agenda,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at think tank Energy Innovation. In his view, the mandate’s definition of capacity density is an ​“absurd metric,” with multiple flaws.


Among other things, the capacity-density measurement does not capture the full picture of what it takes to produce electricity from a fossil-fueled or nuclear power plant.


The metric focuses only on the step where electricity is generated. A full life-cycle analysis would consider all stages for producing equipment, obtaining and transporting fuel, and dealing with waste. The Interior Department’s recent order is ​“entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.


The definition of capacity density also fails to account for the fact that renewable projects can coexist with other activities, such as livestock grazing or farming certain crops, noted Matthias Fripp, global policy research director at Energy Innovation.


Additionally, land used for solar or wind energy can produce electricity for decades, he said, unlike fossil fuels, where the industry must ​“keep finding new land” for resource extraction. Researchers made a similar point in a 2016 study in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, which found the land requirements for coal-fired electricity could equal or exceed those for renewable energy within two to 31 years.


Anderson at the Energy and Policy Institute called the rationale for the Interior Department’s order ​“a red-herring argument to focus on just one of the impacts of different energy sources.”


Nowhere does the order address environmental and health concerns about mining for coal or uranium, drilling for oil and gas, or transporting and burning those fuels. Waste disposal, particularly for coal and nuclear plants, also poses a challenge.


Renewables ​“are obviously leaps and bounds ahead of fossil fuels in terms of their net benefits,” Anderson said.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)During the 2024 election campaign, the Republican Party’s historically fraught relationship with organized labor appeared to be changing. Several influential Republicans reached out to unions, seeking to cement the loyalties of the growing ranks of working-class Americans who have been backing Donald Trump’s presidential runs and voting for other members of his party.
During Trump’s first bid for the White house, the percentage of votes in households where at least one person belongs to a union fell to its lowest level in decades. In 2021, Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator at the time, wrote a USA Today op-ed supporting a unionization drive at an Amazon facility. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, walked a United Auto Workers picket line in 2023 in solidarity with striking workers.
As the 2024 GOP presidential nominee, Trump spotlighted International Brotherhood of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien with a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention — rewarding the union for staying neutral in that campaign after endorsing Joe Biden four years earlier.
Yet O’Brien shocked many in the convention crowd by lambasting longtime GOP coalition partners such as the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable for hurting American workers.
Once in office, Trump continued to signal some degree of solidarity with the blue-collar voters who backed him. He chose former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Teamsters ally, to be his second-term labor secretary.
I’m a sociologist who has been researching the U.S. labor movement for over two decades. Given conservatives’ long-standing antipathy toward unions, I was curious whether the GOP’s greater engagement with labor portended any kind of change in its policies.
 
Fumbled at the starting line
The GOP’s various outreach efforts during the 2024 campaign led University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, a scholar of declining labor power, to write, “Is a pro-labor Republican Party possible?”
More than six months into Trump’s second term, I would say that based on the evidence thus far the answer to Posner’s question is a resounding no.
In late March 2025, Trump issued an executive order stripping hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their collective bargaining rights.
Overnight, twice as many federal employees lost their union protections as there are members of the United Auto Workers union, making the action “the largest and most aggressive single act of union-busting in U.S. history,” according to Georgetown University labor historian Joseph McCartin.
While affected unions have challenged that action and similar subsequent ones in court, the Trump administration is moving onto other agencies. In August, over 400,000 federal employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs and Environmental Protection Agency saw their union contracts terminated and their collective bargaining rights dissolved.
Everett Kelley, the American Federation of Government Employees president, described the attacks on federal workers as a “setback for fundamental rights in America.”
 
Tariffs, other policies aren’t helping
The Trump administration has pitched its erratic tariff policies as a boon to U.S.manufacturing, including in the automotive industry, once the foundation of the U.S. labor movement.
In reality, U.S. car producers are struggling to keep up with rising tariff-related costs of raw materials and parts. The number of factory jobs has fallen to the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, a supporter of targeted tariffs to buttress the domestic auto industry, criticized the administration’s trade policy in April 2025, saying, “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”
Other administration actions cast as relief for struggling workers are unlikely to deliver as advertised. The “no tax on tips” provision in Trump’s huge tax-and-spending package excludes the nearly 40% of tipped workers whose earnings fall below the federal income tax threshold. Tipped workers make up a tiny share of the low-wage workforce.
Culinary Workers Local 226, a powerful Nevada union representing many tipped workers in Las Vegas and Reno, supported the provision. Yet it blasted the overall package, calling it a “big, horrible bill” for its windfalls to the rich instead of the working class.
 
Removing the watchdogs
The National Labor Relations Board is responsible for ensuring management and labor adhere to provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. Passed in 1935, that law established workers’ fundamental rights to collective bargaining. The board is responsible for conducting union elections, investigating allegations of unfair labor practices and outright abuses by employers, and enforcing court orders when employers or unions are found to have broken labor laws.
Presidents regularly use vacancies to tilt the ideological balance of the board to a more or less labor-friendly position. Trump, however, went further.
Soon after he was sworn in for a second term, Trump fired the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel along with board member Gwynne Wilcox, who was only halfway through her five-year term. Wilcox’s dismissal was unprecedented and violated the National Labor Relations Act provision on board personnel changes.
Wilcox’s removal left the body without a quorum, preventing it from responding to appeals or requests for review and allowing employers accused of violating workers’ rights to delay any settlement. The Trump administration has left those important NLRB jobs vacant for months, although it has nominated two management-friendly replacements, both of whom awaited Senate approval in mid-August.
In the meantime, the agency is unable to hear labor disputes.
Disempowering the NLRB is a long-standing Republican tactic, suggesting more continuity with past GOP attacks on labor than a new era of partnership
 
Hawley standing out
To be sure, Republicans don’t all agree with one another on the importance of supporting workers and labor rights. One who has stood out so far is Hawley. The relatively pro-labor Republican senator’s stance led him to partner with Sen. Corey Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to co-sponsor the Faster Labor Contracts Act.
This new bill would force employers to negotiate a contract in a reasonable time frame with employees once they have voted in favor of forming a union.
Hawley also joined with Democrats to reintroduce a bill that would ban dangerous work speed requirements in warehouses. Hawley said, when summarizing his efforts on behalf of working people, “It’s time we deliver for them.”
The Missouri senator is not completely alone. Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Roger Marshall of Kansas, both Republicans, have backed some labor-friendly legislation in the spring and summer of this year.
GOP leaders in Congress are not moving those bills forward so far, likely in part due to pushback from Republicans and their allies outside Congress.
And there are limits to Hawley’s labor friendliness. He voted for Trump’s tax-and-spending package, despite publicly airing his misgivings about the harm it may cause his blue-collar constituents.
Meanwhile, his past partners in the more labor-friendly wing of the GOP now occupy prominent administration posts. Yet they have largely fallen silent on union issues — except, in Rubio’s case, to oversee the firing of well over 1,000 State Department employees, many of them members of the American Foreign Service Association union.
 
Trump labor approach echoes Reagan’s style
Another GOP presidential administration courted segments of the labor movement to divide a key Democratic constituency, only to take actions that weakened unions.
In 1980, for example, Ronald Reagan sought and won the endorsement of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. A year later, he fired 13,000 striking members of that union.
The Teamsters union also backed Reagan — twice. It endorsed him in 1980 after he pledged during the 1980 campaign not to pursue anti-labor policies. Although he broke his promise, personal outreach from Vice President George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the 1984 election earned him the Teamsters endorsement a second time.
What seems clear in my view is that whenever the GOP has tried to cast itself as a labor-friendly political party, it has emphasized symbolism over substance, favoring using rhetoric embracing workers who belong to unions versus taking actions to strengthen labor rights.

Outside of racial violence, many of the most notorious massacres in U.S. history happened when government and big business teamed up to use sheriffs offices, the National Guard, federal troops, and/or private security goons to break up organized labor with extreme violence:
The 1892 Homestead Massacre, the 1894 Pullman Strike, the 1897 Lattimer Massacre, the 1903-04 Colorado Labor Wars, the 1914 Ludlow Massacre, the 1937 Memorial Day Massacre, and the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain in West Virginia, which still stands as the largest armed uprising in America since the Civil War. It was also a tremendous defeat for labor, put down by the U.S. Army, and coal workers were unable to really recover their unions until the mid-1930s, deep into the Great Depression.
Perhaps Cleveland-born folk singer and labor activist Utah Phillips put it best:

        “Kids don’t have a little brother working in the coal mine, they don’t have a little sister coughing her lungs out in the looms of the big mill towns of the Northeast. Why? Because we organized; we broke the back of the sweatshops in this country; we have child labor laws. Those were not benevolent gifts from enlightened management. They were fought for, they were bled for, they were died for by working people, by people like us. Kids ought to know that. That’s why I sing these songs. That’s why I tell these stories, dammit. No root, no fruit!”

Take the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 mentioned above. United Mine Workers of America went on strike in Colorado and on April 20, 1914, workers and their families were attacked by the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel & Iron Company camp guards.
The Colorado National Guard encircled the Ludlow camp and used a machine gun on a bluff overlooking the strikers. When strikers ran out of ammunition to fight back and ran away, the National Guard descended on the camp and set tents on fire with kerosene.
More than two dozen people were killed, including miners’ wives and children. Public outcry after the massacre is credited as a contributor to anti-child labor laws and the eight-hour workday.
Then there’s the story of how Labor Day came to be a national holiday in the first place.
In the summer of 1894, Eugene V. Debs organized the American Railway Union’s strike against the Pullman Company.
U.S. President Grover Cleveland obtained an injunction against the striking workers and ordered the U.S. Army in to enforce it, killing 13 people in the process. In an effort to assuage bad feelings after these events, Cleveland declared Labor Day a federal holiday.
On 4th Street in downtown Columbus, Ohio, just south of Town Street, sits a historical marker. At that site, on Dec. 10, 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Union merged with trade unionists of the Knights of Labor to create the American Federation of Labor.
They also elected Samuel Gompers president of the newly formed AFL, a predicate organization to the modern AFL-CIO.
“What does labor want?” Gompers considered.
“We want more schoolhouses and less jails; more books and less arsenals; more learning and less vice; more leisure and less greed; more justice and less revenge; in fact, more of the opportunities to cultivate our better natures, to make manhood more noble, womanhood more beautiful, and childhood more happy and bright.”

Dr. Rana Alissa hears it daily in the clinic.
“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Labor Day, appropriately, does some annual heavy lifting. It’s the calendar demarcation between summer and fall, although the equinox remains three weeks away. The holiday in the past also marked the last day before school started, but those academic calendars in this part of the world are relics. Oh, and that whole wearing white thing? No longer a thing. 
Most importantly, however, Labor Day serves as a reminder of those American workers who built a nation and keep it running every day, whether their collars be blue or white, their work stations be offices, surgery suites, classrooms, firehouses, squadcars, highways, retail stores, restaurants or any of the hundreds of places we toil to keep the nation moving. 
We take the first Monday in September to celebrate, usually with picnics, parades or private gatherings on patios everywhere. The public confabs usually attract politicians: those in office touting their bona fides when it comes to working men and women and those running for office selling the same with a side of name recognition. Both groups join the festivities to give speeches, kiss babies and generally glad-hand over beers, brats and a day away from work.
What better time than Labor Day, then, to break out this space’s periodic imaginary press conference for Nebraska’s congressional delegation and its governor? As usual, we have questions:

Last week two children, 8 and 10, were murdered while attending Mass at their Catholic school in Minneapolis. The shooter opened fire into the church with an AR-15 assault rifle. Aside from thoughts and prayers and the billions of dollars cut from mental health programs since January, what are your ideas to curb mass shootings in the U.S., of which the Minneapolis shooting was the nation’s 286 version of this modern mayhem?


Using whatever statistical reference you choose, crime in Washington D.C. was at a 30-year low when the president deployed troops there because of … well … crime. He’s threatening to do the same in Chicago, Baltimore and elsewhere and has done so in Los Angeles, bringing about much needed discussion from the Posse Comitatus Act to the hollowing out of ongoing community-police partnerships that reduce crime. What would your reaction be to federal troops on the streets of Omaha or Lincoln if the government — without evidence — insisted crime there was out of control?


As a follow up to the troops now roaming the streets of the nation’s capital, does it strike any of you as painfully ironic that those same National Guard units were not called up for hours while a mob ransacked the Capitol building and tried to overturn a free and fair election? 


Nebraska is now home to an immigration detention camp, heralded as “doing our part.” Proclamations assert the facility is about safety rather immigration. Do any of you have real, empirical evidence that immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than we native born do and that fentanyl crosses the border in higher numbers somewhere other than legal checkpoints, because a survey of current data shows that neither is true?


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells us no one is starving in Gaza while during every news cycle we see searing images that reveal he is just plain wrong. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said aid is being sent to Gaza but that Hamas has stolen it, a charge that aid workers on the ground say is misleading, that, even factoring in theft, there simply is not enough aid being allowed into the country to stave off what is now a famine. What is U.S.’s responsibility to the noncombatants and children of Gaza as they face imminent death?


Speaking of responsibilities, what does Congress owe its constituents — in this case Nebraskans — when a branch of the federal government acts beyond its purview or authority? Please respond specifically to a promise of an executive order to do away with mail-in ballots and voting machines, clearly outside the scope of executive power.


What would you think of the federal government simply admitting it made a mistake (as it did in the beginning of this sad saga) when it arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and everyone just moved on?


Finally, do you ever question why (with two of your votes) we’ve turned over the nation’s health and medical efficacy to a vaccine skeptic who, without education, experience or expertise in science, medicine, epidemiology or research, has gutted health research and limited the availability of a vaccine that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives?

Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care, and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia, and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York, and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%), and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%), and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.
In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont, and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

The report, “A Snapshot of Michigan’s Workforce,” determined that Michigan had the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the nation at 5.3% as of June 2025, compared to the national average of 4.1%. 
Meanwhile, more than half of Michigan’s counties — 54 out of 83 — reported unemployment rates of 6% or higher, with rural communities hit the hardest.
“This Labor Day, as we honor our state’s deep roots in the labor movement and the significant contributions of Michigan’s workers, it’s important to take a close look at the current health of our workforce and what we can be doing to better support the people who make up the backbone of our economy,” Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy, said in a press release.
The report also found that workers’ real earnings are being eroded as wage growth in Michigan is being outpaced by rising costs, with 27% of Michiganders reported to be employed, but under the classification of “asset-limited and income-constrained,” otherwise referred to as ALICE.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXPersistent wage disparities remain for Black and Hispanic workers, as well as for women, particularly women of color, who continue to earn significantly less than their white male counterparts.
“The median wage for Black workers in the state remains significantly lower than white workers, sitting at $20.17, which is 21.6% lower than the median wage of white workers,” the report said. “It is no surprise that as a result, 42% of Black Michiganders find themselves below the ALICE threshold.”
The report notes that the income gap is even slightly larger for Hispanic Michiganders, with median wages about 23% lower than that of white workers.
The report links declining union membership and what it terms as “state-level anti-worker policies” to stagnant wages and reduced protections for employees. 
As a result, it calls for a reversal of laws such as Public Act 98 of 2011, which limits the ability for builder trade unions to negotiate terms of employment, and Public Act 105 of 2015, which limits local governmental bodies from regulating employment terms. 
The league says taken together, the pair of laws have weakened labor protections and hindered local governments’ ability to promote fair labor standards.
The league’s recommendations to strengthen Michigan’s economy and support its workforce include:

Increasing the minimum wage to a living wage and eliminating the sub-minimum tipped wage.
Investing in public transit and K-12 education, and reducing the cost of post-secondary training and college.
Expanding access to affordable child care through increased scholarship reimbursements for providers, which could also help address the ongoing shortage of child care workers.
Making construction and skilled trades jobs more attractive by repealing laws that limit collective bargaining and labor standards.

“While there is an overall job shortage in Michigan, there are some sectors of the state’s workforce where workers are urgently needed. This includes the child care and construction workforce,” Stanton said. “If we want Michigan to be a state where working families can raise young children and support the growing demand for newly built homes, we need to be making the jobs in those industries more desirable for prospective candidates.”
Stanton said that improving compensation and working conditions in these sectors, which she says are often dominated by women and people of color, is essential to building a more equitable and resilient state economy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut can’t afford another $500m on our electric bills,Laura Francis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/connecticut-cant-afford-another-500m-on-our-electric-bills/,Why should all Connecticut ratepayers be stuck with the bill for undergrounding lines in Fairfield County?,"As Executive Director of the South Central Connecticut Council of Governments (SCRCOG), I speak often with municipal leaders, business owners, and residents about one of Connecticut’s most pressing concerns: the high cost of electricity.
Energy costs affect everything we care about — attracting jobs, retaining families, and maintaining a livable cost of living. Yet Connecticut’s electric rates are already among the highest in the country, and without careful decisions, they will only climb higher.
From conversations with UI, Eversource, and energy experts, I know the reasons are complex. Utility infrastructure is heavily taxed, with those costs passed directly to consumers. More than half of our power comes from natural gas that must be transported hundreds of miles, adding costs at every step. State policies have also layered more and more programs onto electric bills over time.
These factors aren’t easy to solve, but one thing is clear: we must avoid adding unnecessary costs. That’s why I’m deeply concerned about a proposal under review by the Connecticut Siting Council — the request to bury seven miles of high-voltage transmission lines in Fairfield and part of Bridgeport by a vocal minority of Fairfield County residents and some of their elected officials.
If approved, this project would add approximately $500 million to electric bills statewide.
For years, UI has been rebuilding transmission lines across its service area to replace aging infrastructure and improve reliability. In New Haven, West Haven, Milford, Stratford, and other towns, these upgrades have been completed overhead — the most cost-efficient approach — with little controversy.
But in Fairfield and Bridgeport, a small group of residents, businesses, and nonprofits has been lobbying for an underground solution. While their preference is understandable, it’s important to recognize who would pay for that decision.
Under New England’s rules, the costs of standard overhead transmission projects are shared among all 14 million regional ratepayers. But any additional costs — including underground installation — fall entirely on Connecticut customers. That means residents and businesses across Connecticut – not just Fairfield and Bridgeport, but also in 167 other cities and towns – would be forced to subsidize a project that benefits only two of our state’s communities.
Put simply: Connecticut ratepayers would bear the approximately $500 million burden so a few neighborhoods in Fairfield County could get a gold-plated solution.
You might expect widespread opposition to such an inequitable proposal. Yet surprisingly few elected officials have spoken out. Most of the lawmakers who have weighed in — from both parties — represent Fairfield, Bridgeport, or nearby towns, and many have called an underground option the “only acceptable” outcome.
I understand the pressure they face. Local officials must represent their constituents, and the most vocal voices in their districts are demanding undergrounding. But this is precisely when leaders from across Connecticut must step forward to defend the interests of the broader public.
This isn’t just an energy issue. It’s a matter of fairness, economic competitiveness, and protecting the residents and employers who power Connecticut’s economy.
The Connecticut Siting Council has not yet made its decision on this proposal, though they are expected to in the coming weeks. I urge elected officials, community leaders, and residents across the state to speak up. Contact your legislators. Submit comments to the Siting Council. Raise awareness within your communities. The voices of a vocal minority should not outweigh the needs of the many.
Connecticut families and businesses cannot afford another $500 million on our electric bills. We need thoughtful, disciplined decisions that protect affordability and fairness for everyone — not just a select few.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Speaking to a crowd of more than 200 in a Raleigh town hall, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) denounced President Donald Trump’s treatment of veterans, calling cuts to veterans affairs and the firing of veterans in government “devastating.”
“He doesn’t understand us, he doesn’t understand service, he doesn’t understand sacrifice to this nation and sacrifice before self,” Kelly said. “That’s why you see the attacks on veterans and institutions that support veterans, whether it’s the VA or just the firing of so many veterans in government jobs after their service.”
Kelly, a 24-year U.S. military veteran who began as a naval aviator before his selection as an astronaut in 1996, condemned the president for calling Marines who died in combat “suckers” and “losers” during his first term, comments reported by Trump’s former chief of staff, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general.
“How many veterans are in his family? Zero,” Kelly said. “His family didn’t serve, and I think that’s one of the reasons he feels this way.”
A swing state Senate Democrat with broad popularity — a May survey by Noble Predictive Insights showed him with +15 favorability — Kelly is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, but said he was in North Carolina to support veterans and former Gov. Roy Cooper’s 2026 U.S. Senate bid. He was in Asheville on Saturday and will be in Charlotte on Monday with his wife former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords.
He was joined by state party chair Anderson Clayton in Asheville. For the Raleigh town hall, which was comprised mainly of military veterans and their families, he spoke alongside Attorney General Jeff Jackson, an Army National Guard Major.

Jackson said he was proud his office helped fend off efforts to toss out military and overseas ballots in North Carolina’s 2024 state Supreme Court election, praising “the civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to sticking up for you and defending the Constitution.”
“We’ve got five or six people who you will never meet who spent a straight seven months on this case — no time off, no vacation, not for the holidays, not for birthdays, not for families because this was that important,” he said.
Jackson also touted the N.C. Department of Justice’s support for a challenge to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ cancelation of collective bargaining agreements with government workers’ unions, drawing applause from veterans in the audience.
“This is an attack on working class folks, right? I mean, unions help raise wages and benefits for working class people. That’s why they want to get rid of union participation at the VA and make it harder for people to organize and fight for higher wages and healthcare and those kinds of benefits,” Kelly said.
Kelly staked out a guarded position on relations with China, calling the country a “pure adversary” and telling audience members concerned about rising tensions between the two nations that an invasion of Taiwan would prompt “the hardest decision any president has to make about whether or not we get into a war with China.”
“I think we’ve got to take every step possible to avoid getting in a conflict with another country that has a significant nuclear arsenal, so I worry about China a lot,” Kelly said. “Right now, I think in a conflict with China, we would prevail. Is that going to be true 10 years from now? I’m not so sure.”
One of several Democrats vetted as a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Kelly has spoken in several key states this year, including Michigan in July and South Carolina in June, traditionally the site of the first-in-the-South presidential primary.

Talking to reporters after the event, Kelly declined to answer whether he was considering a 2028 presidential campaign, saying he is “really focused on 2026 — that is the election that matters.”
He said he traveled to North Carolina to speak to veterans who don’t have veteran representation in Congress and to support Cooper’s campaign. “I want to do everything I can to help him get elected because I think the path to taking back control of the United States Senate goes right through North Carolina.”
He told the town hall crowd that he sees an opportunity to flip the U.S. Senate in 2026 amid growing disapproval of the Trump administration’s handling of the economy and immigration as well as its attacks on institutions.
“If you had asked me three or four months ago, I would have said, probably not possible that we take back the Senate,” Kelly said. “It is today, especially with Roy Cooper running.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8313416-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-31 19:56:53.157472

According to a news release, the order follows “some pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter.”
The order directs the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but with new restrictions. As noted in the new health order, people over the age of 65 are eligible, under the new FDA rules, for the vaccine, with younger people requiring an underlying medical issue for eligibility.  According to the news release, the state anticipates the updated COVID-19 vaccine to begin arriving in New Mexico in the next few weeks.
“It’s important for New Mexicans to know the New Mexico Department of Health is committed to keeping residents safe as we enter the 2025 – 2026 respiratory virus season,” Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “This order will remove obstacles to vaccination access.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)GRAND ISLAND — The Nebraska State Fair started Aug. 22 with Gov. Jim Pillen and retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., talking from the Earl May Fair Square Stage about their love of the fair. 
Pillen said the fair gets “better and better each year.” Bacon called it “such a treat” to be there. Pillen said it’s important to appreciate “who we are as Nebraskans.” Bacon said he enjoys how the fair celebrates agriculture.  
While the stock shows and food are the main attractions at the fair — which is older than the state itself, the state’s political parties and politicians still engage in politics there, as Republican and Democratic Party leaders view it as a great way to connect with Nebraskans.
“For many people, the fair may be their only face-to-face interaction with the party outside of campaign season,” a Nebraska GOP spokesperson said. “It’s a chance to listen, to build relationships, and to remind folks that the Republican Party is part of the Nebraska tradition, just like the fair itself.”
Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb calls the fair an excellent opportunity for Democrats to meet voters where they are — and to enjoy a beef sundae, a fair concoction of mashed potatoes, shredded beef and cheese and sour cream, topped with cherry tomatoes to resemble an ice cream sundae.
“We must be there to represent, provide valuable party and candidate information, register voters and visit with Nebraskans who want a better future for our state and country,” Kleeb said.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who had a booth of his own, said, “Nothing surpasses being able to talk face-to-face with Nebraskans and hear their thoughts” about the state.
There might be a chance for fairgoers to spot state senators such as Stan Clouse and Loren Lippincott, as well as members of the federal delegation, including 3rd District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, walking past a combine.
Kathleen Lodl, 4-H Program Administrator and an ex-officio member of the State Fair’s Executive Board, said fairs are a chance for people to come together to share ideas, so it makes sense why political parties and candidates show up.

The political presence is a bit different than in past fairs, as one Nebraska State Fair tradition is fading — candidate debates. 
The most recent traditional State Fair debates came in 2018, when U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., debated State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a member of the Lincoln City Council at the time, and then-Gov. Pete Ricketts debated State Sen. Bob Krist of Omaha for governor.

In 2022, there were no debates at the State Fair between Pillen and former State Sen. Carol Blood for governor, as Pillen chose not to debate. Nor was there a fair debate between former State Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks and 1st Congressional District U.S. Representative Mike Flood. 
During his 2024 bid against Fischer, registered nonpartisan Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn pushed to debate Fischer at the fair, but she and her campaign declined. Smith and his 2024 Democratic challenger, Daniel Ebers, didn’t debate either.
Former Nebraska State Fair Executive Director Bill Ogg said he didn’t get an inquiry about a State Fair debate in 2022 — which he considered surprising. 
“It’s customary to debate at the Nebraska State Fair, a tradition…” Osborn said in his campaign video last year. 
Lodl said fewer candidates need to reach broad in-person audiences like those at the fair because “communication media has changed.”  
“So now instead of having to go to a public debate … we see those on TV so that they can hit a wider audience of people. And so it wasn’t necessary to have a public platform,” Lodl said. 
Some candidates also turn down media-sponsored debates.
Osborn attended the fair last week as an audience member for now-U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ federal issues forum. Ricketts faced a few hecklers and outbursts on Friday and defended his support for the tax and spending measure President Donald Trump labeled the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

At one point, an audience member yelled, “You’re a f— traitor, Pete!”
While there were occasional outbursts, most of the central Nebraska crowd supported Ricketts. The forum featured panels from Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and U.S. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming. Barraso and Ricketts talked about the benefits of preserving the tax cuts from Trump’s first term and how Republicans’ new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps are modest. 
Ricketts and other officials took no questions from the audience. Ricketts told the Examiner that despite the outbursts, the forum “went wonderfully well” and said such forums give people an opportunity to “hear directly what’s going on in Washington, D.C.”  
Osborn criticized Ricketts’ defense of the bill, saying in a social media post that the “math doesn’t add up.” He said the emergency funds for rural hospitals Congress put in the tax and spending bill weren’t enough to replace the same bill’s longer-term cuts to Medicaid.  
In modern politics, Osborn’s post and any Ricketts responses might be the closest voters get to a political debate at the fair, but both Ricketts and Osborn have expressed a willingness to debate during the 2026 race. 
Over at the Pinnacle Bank Expo Center, fairgoers walking near the political booths showed mild interest in what the booths offered. 
The state GOP booth featured cutouts of President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, tables filled with pamphlets from Republican candidates and yard signs. Fairgoers could test their knowledge of the Constitution with a small sign wheel. 
Nebraska Republican Party Chair Mary Jane Truemper, who manned the GOP booth on Friday, said her public interactions were positive, adding that people seem to really like Vance.

Some fairgoers took pictures with the presidential and vice presidential cutouts. Trumper said booth volunteers saw a few people who gave them side eye as they walked by the booth. 
The Democrats’ booth offered information about how to get involved with the party and a pamphlet resembling a newspaper, featuring a headline, “Democrats win big,” with a picture of Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., who defeated Incumbent Republican Mayor Jean Stothert this year. 
Volunteers at the booth said that the people who typically visit are already Democrats. Still, they see it as an opportunity to recruit them to volunteer for the party and its candidates. 
Ricketts visited the GOP booth to have small talk with Truemper, saying he had never seen a party chair at the fair booth before.

Larry Rhoden.
He said the mobilization comes at the request of President Donald Trump. Rhoden said South Dakota “stands in solidarity” with the president’s efforts.
“With the National Guard’s help, President Trump has restored law and order to our nation’s capital – and our guardsmen will help keep it that way,” Rhoden said. “We will not sit on the sidelines while crime threatens the safety of our families.”

The 12 soldiers are from the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment based in Rapid City. They will serve in a public affairs capacity in the joint information command center.
The mobilization is under the command of the D.C. National Guard and is federally funded, Rhoden said. The initial deployment is expected to last for 30 days.
Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district on Aug. 11, even though violent crime in the district is at a 30-year low. He mobilized the District of Columbia National Guard, which he is able to do because the district is not a state, to assist local law enforcement. Guard troops from West Virginia, Louisiana, Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina also have sent troops to the nation’s capital.
Free DC, a group that advocates for district self-governance, has called the move dictatorial.
“Trump is laying the groundwork to quell all public dissent to his agenda. If he is successful, it would spell the end of American democracy,” the group said. “We refuse to allow that to happen.”

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Immigration raid at Washington blaze stokes fear in wildfire crews nationwide

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”

Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.

BLENDON TWP. — A proposed large-scale battery energy storage system in Blendon Township has sparked environmental and health concerns among residents, though a formal application for the project has not yet been submitted.
Township officials are considering a proposal for a battery energy storage system, or BESS, which is designed to store electricity from the power grid and release it during periods of peak demand.
The parcel would be at 8284 88th Ave., located in the township’s northwest corner.
The concept is new to the township and to much of Michigan, which currently has no battery storage facilities in place.
“This is new to us,” said Township Supervisor Greg Golembiewski. “Everyone has more questions than answers right now.”
The company, Key Capture Energy, first approached township officials with the proposal about 18 months ago. Residents’ primary concerns revolve around the risks of fires and potential groundwater contamination from a chemical leak.
Golembiewski confirmed on Wednesday, Aug. 28, that no formal application had been submitted by KCE. The township’s planning commission would need to approve the project once it is formally presented before anything can happen, Golembiewski said.
“There is nothing on the planning commission agenda, and I haven’t heard back from Key Capture about their application. We don’t like to speculate until we see a formal application and there is nothing right now,” he said.
Many residents attended an Aug. 18 public hearing to voice opposition to the facility, highlighting a local dispute now intertwined with a statewide legal challenge over renewable energy development in Michigan. According to meeting minutes, residents expressed fears about fire, water contamination and safety, including:

Fire risks associated with large-scale battery storage facilities.
Water usage, especially in light of current issues with wells drying up in the area.
Lack of clear evacuation plans for neighboring areas in the event of an emergency.

“Residents urged the board to reconsider the ordinance and to take into account the safety, environmental, and governance implications before proceeding,” according to the meeting minutes.
Golembiewski said residents have “valid” concerns, which is why the company held a public hearing about the project in July. At that time, KCE officials were on site to answer questions and address residents’ concerns.
If the project is built, Blendon Township would be the first Michigan location for KCE which owns and operates 14 facilities — 11 in Texas and three in New York — totaling more than 620 megawatts.
 What is BESS?

According to the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan, large-scale battery storage sites are a crucial part of the new renewable energy grid. Because industrial wind turbines and solar fields do not produce a constant supply of power, BESS facilities store electricity for when it is needed most.
The BESS sites, which look like rows of shipping containers filled with lithium-ion batteries, can draw surplus energy from the power grid. They then sell this stored electricity back to utility companies at a higher price during periods of high demand, helping to balance the grid and prevent shortages.
The proposed Blendon Township site is a 12-acre site at 8284 88th Ave., where KCE hopes to put a four-hour, 100-megawatt battery storage facility.
Company officials have said they chose the location because it has the capacity to house standalone battery storage. The property is also close to the existing transmission grid and has an adjacent electric substation, which makes it easier to connect to the existing system.
 Next steps

Blendon Township could consider two paths for permitting the KCE project. If the township approves a Compatible Renewable Energy ordinance, it could receive a State Renewable Ready Communities Grant.
This grant would pay the township $5,000 per megawatt-hour, totaling $500,000 for the KCE facility. The township would receive half of that amount when construction begins and the other half when the project is finished.
However, if the township denies the proposal, KCE can bypass the local approval process and apply directly to the state under Act 233, a law signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in November 2023. In that case, the township would not receive the grant money.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-30-081929-1024x526.png,,,2025-08-31 14:57:20.276145

Heather Honey, a high-profile denier of Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, has been appointed to a senior position in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in which she’ll help oversee the nation’s election infrastructure.
Honey is a protege of Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who tried to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results. In 2024, ProPublica reported that Honey had played a key role in Mitchell’s behind-the-scenes effort to change Georgia’s election rules to allow Republican officials to contest a potential Trump loss in that year’s presidential race. Honey also promoted election conspiracy theories, including one Trump cited in a speech to his followers before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Though states do the on-the-ground work of running elections, DHS supports them with tasks beyond their capacities, such as protecting IT infrastructure and voter databases from foreign intrusions. The agency, with bipartisan support, took on this role in the aftermath of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
Experts on voting and state election officials warned that Honey’s appointment as DHS’ deputy assistant secretary of election integrity could erode trust between state and federal officials, prompting states not to share information with the agency.
“We are witnessing a dangerous trend: the elevation of known bad-faith actors like Heather Honey,” said Adrian Fontes, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, in a statement, citing Honey’s “well-documented history of spreading election lies that have been debunked in court.”
Fontes called her involvement with DHS “deeply troubling” and said “when the agency gives a platform to individuals who have actively worked to erode public trust, it becomes harder to view DHS as a reliable partner in election security.”
A DHS spokesperson did not answer questions from ProPublica on Honey’s appointment or the exact nature of her responsibilities. Honey didn’t respond to calls or emails. The White House also didn’t respond to a request for comment. Her name is listed on the organization’s leadership structure online, and her appointment was first reported by the website Democracy Docket.

In the first Trump administration, the federal government set up programs designed to shield U.S. elections from foreign interference, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, an arm of DHS. But Trump soured on this and other initiatives after the director of CISA publicly rebutted his claims that the 2020 election was stolen.
Since the start of the second Trump presidency, the administration has gutted those programs, cutting hundreds of employees at CISA. Its director, Chris Krebs, is now under federal investigation, DHS has said; Krebs told CNN that the investigation appeared to be an act of political retribution. The Justice Department has also rolled back a program aimed at combatting foreign influence campaigns. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a memorandum that the Justice Department’s program was disbanded to “free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion.”
David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit focused on building trust in American elections, said the cuts had dismantled “nearly all” of DHS’ capacity to protect election infrastructure. He said state elections officials feared that Honey’s appointment, combined with the program cuts, signaled the Trump administration’s intent to eliminate bulwarks of fair U.S. elections.
“The hiring of an election conspiracy theorist with no election knowledge or expertise is the culmination of this reversal,” Becker said. “DHS now appears poised to become a primary amplifier of false election conspiracies pushed by our enemies.”
Two sources familiar with Honey’s hiring at DHS said she began working for the agency last week. An organizational chart dated Aug. 18 on the department’s website identifies her as a leader in the agency’s Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans. Her position wasn’t on a version of the website archived in July, and officials in former administrations said that there’s been no such job previously.
It’s not clear yet what Honey will oversee, but former DHS officials said that deputy assistant secretaries are typically the agency’s top experts in their subject areas. They’re often involved in drafting executive orders and crafting policies. They also serve as liaisons to the White House and the National Security Council.
Since Honey started, Trump has announced “a movement to get rid of” mail-in ballots and voting machines via executive order, though a top aide subsequently said the administration would pursue those goals through legislative action. DHS has also threatened to cut off about $28 million in grants to help states prepare for terrorism and disasters if they don’t change voting rules to conform to the administration’s priorities, NPR has reported.
Honey’s duties likely would include helping to organize the government’s policy responses if foreign actors make intrusions into the nation’s election systems, former officials said. To do this, and to assess the security of election infrastructure, someone in her position would typically have access to classified information, including the government’s election-related intelligence.
Experts expressed concern about Honey’s portfolio, given her history of spreading misinformation.
“Heather Honey’s past misleading claims about vote counts in Pennsylvania, among other things, have helped fuel false conspiracy theories about stolen elections,” said Larry Norden, an election expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, a nonpartisan law and policy group.
Before becoming swept up in the “Stop the Steal” movement, Honey had no experience in the federal government or as an election administrator, working as a Pennsylvania-based private investigator.
After the 2020 election, she became a contractor for a Republican-backed audit seeking proof of fraud in ballots cast in Maricopa County, Arizona. According to emails between employees working on the review, which ended up reaffirming Biden’s win, Honey helped draft the final report.
Since then, Honey has led at least three organizations devoted to transforming election systems in ways championed by conservatives, such as tightening eligibility requirements for people to be on voter rolls. Members of Honey’s Pennsylvania Fair Elections, a state chapter of Mitchell’s nationwide Election Integrity Network, have challenged the eligibility of thousands of residents to be on voter rolls.
Honey has also been involved in numerous other efforts to transform elections around the country, including a successful push to get many states with Republican leadership to pull out of a bipartisan interstate partnership to share data to make voting more secure.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)In 2005, as a reporter embedded with a Missouri National Guard unit in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I witnessed one of the largest disaster relief operations in American history.
On the ground with the men and women of a Missouri Guard military police company, I was far removed from the decisions — and the blunders — that would ultimately mar the massive rescue effort. Instead, I saw firsthand how average Americans coped with the hardships and uncertainty of being thrown into a situation without precedent.
It was dirty and messy, and the outcome was uncertain. I ate MREs with the Guardsmen and chatted about their families and listened to concerns about their Constitutional duties as soldiers.
Now, the National Guard is on the streets of the District of Columbia, with live ammunition, summoned by President Donald Trump to assist in a hastily declared and thinly supported law enforcement mission. Trump is also considering other Democratic stronghold cities for such deployments, including Chicago and New York.
The contrast between the deployments could not be sharper.

Twenty years ago, the National Guard was called up in the thousands for a devastating national disaster. Today, the Guard is in DC on a partisan mission that breaks political norms. If Trump federalizes the Guard and sends it to other cities, it would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a foundational 1878 law meant to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement on American soil.
The storm that struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, was devastating. In addition to winds in excess of 100 mph that turned roofs into sails and toppled walls, Katrina also brought a surge of water that overwhelmed levees and flood walls and submerged 80% of the city. A citywide evacuation had been ordered, but some residents stayed, including many from the poorer sections of the city who didn’t have anywhere else to go. Thirty thousand people spent days in the shelter of last resort, the Louisiana Superdome, without lights or air conditioning, food or water, or functioning restrooms. Misery was widespread across the city, especially in the Lower Ninth Ward, a historically Black section of the city that experienced catastrophic flooding.
The hurricane left 1,800 people dead in New Orleans and across the Gulf coast and displaced more than a million. Katrina was also the costliest storm on record, with damage estimated at $161 billion.
But the Missouri National Guard unit I was embedded with didn’t know any of this on its convoy to New Orleans. When the soldiers of the 1138th Military Police piled into their Humvees and trucks at company headquarters at West Plains, Missouri, they had about as much information (or rather, misinformation) about the situation on the Gulf as did anyone who had been paying attention to the news. They expected out-of-control looting and general lawlessness. But the reports of looting were exaggerated and the most lawless element was among the New Orleans police, who shot 10 civilians, including four fatally.
Katrina showed how crucial federal funding is after a disaster. How much will remain?

Because I was with the Missouri National Guard unit every hour of every day on the convoy south, I knew what they were talking about. There were earnest discussions among the soldiers about what they would do if ordered to fire on American citizens for looting, and the consensus was that they would refuse. What looked like looting to one individual might just be survival. Somebody might be carrying a television to trade for food and water. Above all, they wanted to help people in need, by effecting rescues or bringing much-needed supplies.
Later, as I walked the French Quarter, I noted maroon-bereted 82nd Airborne soldiers on patrol with automatic rifles at hand. This was a disturbing sight in an American city, one that brought to mind third-world countries. But this was no banana republic. This was New Orleans in distress, and some regular Army troops, in addition to National Guard units from all 50 states, had been sent to help.
The National Guard has been deployed on American soil periodically for disaster relief or to assist local authorities with civil unrest. The latter includes the George Floyd protests in 2020, the LA riots of 1992, and at Kent State.
On May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Vietnam war protestors on the Kent State University campus, killing four students. A photograph of one of the dead students, with a girl kneeling and crying out for help behind, shook the soul of America — and won the Pulitzer Prize.
The Ohio Guard had been sent to the campus by Gov. Jim Rhodes, at the request of the Kent mayor, after the ROTC building had been burned to the ground the previous night. The Guard, with bayonets fixed, was attempting to disperse a crowd of 2,000 demonstrators. The students threw rocks, and the soldiers responded with tear gas. Then, in the space of 13 seconds, the Guardsmen fired more than 60 shots at demonstrators.
It is unclear why the soldiers took kneeling positions and opened fire, although one of the survivors said there is audio tape evidence of the command being given. Eight Ohio Guardsmen were acquitted in 1974 after a judge declared, after a two-week trial, that the government had presented insufficient evidence to support the federal indictments.
The National Guard is generally exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act, as it is normally under the control of state governors, but it becomes subject when it is called up under federal service. The District of Columbia is a special case, because the district is under control of Congress and the president is, in effect, the governor of the district.
If Trump were to deploy the Guard elsewhere, there would be a host of legal challenges. But he has already demonstrated his willingness to expand the use of the military on U.S. soil, as his administration has authorized the Guard to be deployed to assist with “alien processing” in 20 states with Republican governors. The states with Democratic governors, including Kansas, would no doubt object.
Katrina alters local health care landscape, though underlying ills still the same

The militarization of immigration and law enforcement is disturbing. Trump is using it to punish jurisdictions that are Democratic strongholds, many of which have significant Black populations, and others that are hotbeds of dissent. His official justifications don’t pass the litmus test of truth. He claimed to deploy the Guard in D.C. to fight crime, despite violent crime there hitting a 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.
Some leaders in Kansas City, Missouri, are worried their city may be next.
“I do think Kansas City should be prepared, because this will probably happen to us,” said Kansas City Democrat Barbara Washington, as reported by the Kansas City Star. “I think the actions of our president have shown that he is not open to equality for people of color.”
While other politicians doubt Trump will take interest in any city in a state as deeply red as Missouri, some worry the high crime rates of Kansas City and St. Louis may be enough of an excuse. Kansas, where 101 out of 105 counties went for Trump in 2024, may be relatively safe. Well, except for the city of Lawrence, which might just be blue enough to attract the president’s dictatorial gaze; it went for Kamala Harris by a margin of more than 2-1.
In D.C., the 2,200 Guard members have spent the past week mulching cherry trees and clearing homeless camps. That would be in keeping with Trump’s obsession with the value of real estate and his disregard for human life. But the true goal of the deployment appears to be a further test of just how much the American public will take before standing up to authoritarianism. Congress and the Supreme Court have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to Trump, so ultimately any change must come from the ballot box.
In the seven months Trump has been in power, he has upended convention and pursued an unchecked appetite for power. The American landscape has been transformed into a terrain fit for a dictator, with ever-expanding executive power, a masked secret cadre of ICE agents pursuing migrants and sometimes citizens, a crackdown on diversity and dissent, and the growing presence of an armed military in our cities.
How long will it be before there’s another 13 seconds in which the National Guard faces off against unarmed protestors and in the chaos leaves one or more “dead on the ground?” This is something Trump may be actually hoping for, because any act of violence serves as an excuse to call out more troops. And more troops means more intimidation, more control, more power.
Trump is building a case for martial law through a series of immigration and law enforcement “emergencies,” but only for those blue cities he’d like to punish or neutralize. Chicago, New York, Baltimore. It would only be a small step from there to declaring an election emergency. He wouldn’t have to cancel or postpone the 2026 midterms. Just the presence of armed troops at polling places to ensure a “fair” election might discourage enough voters to do the trick. He’s already vowed to end mail-in voting, an anti-democracy pledge that would have sunk any other president quicker than you can say Watergate.
Since Katrina, infrastructure shortcomings create resiliency fatigue

I don’t know what the National Guard troops deployed in D.C. are thinking, or what those who might be tasked with “alien processing” feel about it. All I have is my experience with that Missouri National Guard military police company a generation ago. But based on that, I suspect directing the Guard to deprive American citizens of their civil liberties might be more difficult than Trump thinks. Many will remember their oath is to the Constitution, not to any president or ideology.
Recently, the Trump administration placed on leave some 30 Federal Emergency Management Agency employees who signed an open letter warning of a Katrina-level disaster because of agency mismanagement. The Trump-appointed leadership, the letter said, was simply too inexperienced and too partisan to do their jobs.
The letter cited the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which exposed the federal government’s failures to prepare for disasters and deliver aid quickly.
There will never be another Hurricane Katrina.
But that’s only because the World Meteorological Organization retired the name after 2005. There will be other storms, equal to or worse than Katrina, and Trump administration ignores the signatories of the warning letter at our peril.
We find ourself in an age of storms.
To survive the current political hurricane, we must find the courage to stand up to political bullying, be guided by reason but moved by compassion, and be willing to help those among us who are in the most danger of being washed away.
The situation is without precedent.
Never before, not even during Watergate, has a U.S. president engaged in such an authoritarian power grab. If we were faced with one or two crises at a time, then it would be easier to know how to respond. But the entire federal government has been turned inside out and made the political instrument of one man. From the dismantling of the intelligence community to the purging of scientific integrity at public health and disaster response agencies, from the war on migrants to the squelching of dissent on college campuses, and now to the use of the military in law enforcement, the house Abraham Lincoln referred to in his 1858 speech is not just divided, but on fire.
“I want to speak plainly about the moment that we are in, and the actual crisis, not the manufactured one, that we are facing in this city, and as a state, and as a country,” Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said Aug. 25 in Chicago. “If it sounds to you like I am alarmed, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed.”
The odds that either of the Kansas Cities or Lawrence or any other blue dot in a red state will be targeted right now is low, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t respond to Pritzker’s tocsin. It will be dirty and messy, the outcome will be uncertain, and there will be a lot of talk about civil disobedience and our Constitutional obligations as citizens. We are beyond the guardrails of a two-party system and are now facing a party of one with ever-expanding executive power. It’s time for us to talk, at our kitchen tables and taverns and community centers, and decide what orders we’ll follow — and what kind of nation we want.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.













We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics





Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

 In an era when facts are contested and expertise is under siege, it’s worth remembering that data not only informs policy—it can transform lives. 
The post Trump rejects data he doesn’t like. Boston faces troubling facts head-on to craft solutions to problems. appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","READ THE HEADLINES of the past few weeks – and you’ll see a common theme of an administration that rejects data and science that don’t suit their quest to consolidate power.  
Don’t like the jobs report? Fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Want to clamp down on American cities? Ignore the data that says crime in Washington, DC, is down 30 percent and call up the National Guard. Reject climate science. Dismantle the Education Department. Undermine academic research. And last week, force out your own head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only weeks after she took office, apparently over her  unwillingness to reject the CDC’s own science.  
These are far from the only examples, in an administration that has systematically replaced experts, researchers, and data with sycophants, charlatans, and falsehoods. 
Why does this matter? In an era when facts are contested and expertise is under siege, it’s worth remembering that data not only informs policy—it can transform lives. 
In 2008, The Boston Foundation released a groundbreaking report with a stark finding: only 35 percent of Boston Public Schools graduates who enrolled in college were earning a degree within seven years. The implications were clear and deeply troubling. A system that was helping students reach the college door was failing to see them through it to graduation. 
Mayor Tom Menino didn’t look away. He didn’t question the data’s accuracy, attack the researchers, or dismiss the messenger. Instead, he called a meeting. 
Gathering city leaders, educators, philanthropists, and nonprofits at the Boston Foundation’s offices, Menino declared: “We can do better. And we will.”  
From that moment came Success Boston—a citywide initiative that provided coaching, advising, and support to help students persist through college and into careers. Today, nearly two decades later, Success Boston has helped to nearly double the share of Boston Public Schools graduates completing higher education. The lessons are simple: Data reveals the problem, and leadership turns it into progress. 
Data doesn’t solve problems, especially when these problems are as complex and systemic as the challenges that face us in areas like housing, education, and health care. However, it provides us with insights into what is working and what is not. It guides innovative strategies that can make a meaningful difference in tackling those problems. 
When leaders fire the messenger instead of confronting the message, as the president did when firing Erika McEntarfer as the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consequences go far beyond politics. They erode public trust in our institutions. They blur the line between fact and fiction. And most dangerously, they leave us flying blind in moments that demand clear-eyed solutions. 
At The Boston Foundation, we’ve long believed that data is not an obstacle to be overcome—it’s a compass to be followed. It allowed my predecessor, Paul Grogan, whose sometimes rocky relationship with City Hall caused some to think that he would be a political rival to the mayor, to work with Mayor Menino to benefit the children of Boston.  
Success Boston is far from the only example. For more than two decades, the Greater Boston Housing Report Card has used local, state, and federal data to track housing supply and affordability in Greater Boston.  
By examining more granular affordable housing data, Mayor Michelle Wu was able to identify specific buildings with expiring affordability restrictions, map neighborhoods most at risk of displacement, and quantify the gap between existing affordable units and projected need. This evidence base enabled policymakers and funders like The Boston Foundation to prioritize investments, craft targeted preservation strategies, and mobilize community-based organizations to intervene before homes were lost.  
Without this data-driven approach, the effort would have been reactive rather than proactive, missing the window to protect the housing that families depend on. It’s why Boston has emerged as a national leader in so many areas—not because we’ve had all the answers, but because we’ve had the humility to ask hard questions. 
We are now relying on data as we work with partners across Massachusetts to address the numerous harms being inflicted on the state by federal actions. Our work to address food insecurity, for example, in the wake of federal changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is informed by Boston Indicators’ research to identify the communities most at risk and the organizations most in need of additional funds to meet what will be a rising demand for food assistance. 
As citizens, we should expect and demand smart, informed leadership at every level of government. We deserve leadership that listens when the numbers are uncomfortable. Leadership that believes in transparency over theatrics.  Leadership that trusts evidence over agendas. Leadership whose mantra is: “Let’s solve this together,” not “You’re fired.” 
Numbers don’t create change—people do. What Mayor Menino understood, and what we strive to carry forward today, is that data must be paired with courage, collaboration, and community voice. Success Boston didn’t just work because of spreadsheets; it worked because coaches met students where they were, nonprofits stepped up to expand their services, and a city was willing to invest in long-term solutions. 
Boston is not perfect. No city is. But we are at our best when we treat knowledge as a public good, not a political threat. When Donald Trump ignores, denigrates, discards or destroys data that counter his narrow world view, he condemns us all to a future of failed policies and flawed decisions.  
As we in Massachusetts are forced to repair the damage inflicted on us by these policies, we can and should use the available data to make informed choices. If we do that, we can provide the strong leadership this nation will need to get through the coming years.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.
Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1140192021-1024x7371744799798-1.jpg,,,2025-08-31 10:56:20.925103

The land will also be enrolled in the Iowa Habitat and Access Program, which allows for public hunting and habitat management on the land. 
Hunters harvested 27,500 quail in Iowa in 2024, according to the DNR’s harvest season data. 
Eric Sytsma, Quail Forever’s habitat protection officer, said the property will be “key to continue and expand efforts to improve the growing quail population.” 
Quail Forever, a nonprofit that works with Pheasants Forever, is dedicated to habitat conservation for upland birds. The two groups have more than 750 local chapters nationwide and have been involved in habitat conservation projects on 28.8 million acres. 
This latest parcel was purchased with the organization’s Build a Wildlife Area program, which chapters, partners and participants donate to. 
“We’re very thankful to everyone who has helped grow our Build a Wildlife Area program in the Hawkeye state and across the country to allow us to complete great projects for upland birds and hunting access,” Sytsma said in the press release. 
According to Quail Forever, the program has allowed the organization to purchase and maintain habitat on more than 4,900 acres in Iowa. 
In total, Iowa has about 1 million acres of public land, or 1,576 square miles, according to a fact sheet from Sierra Club Iowa Chapter. In total, the state has 36 million acres of land, a little more than 30 million of which are dedicated to agriculture.

Rex Cannon, co-president of pipeline developer 8 Star Alaska, told attendees of the annual Alaska Oil and Gas Association conference that his company intends to finalize gas sales agreements and then make a final investment decision on pipeline construction before the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. 
If the project advances to completion, it would end more than 50 years of false starts, missed goals and dropped promises from a wide variety of developers.
“I’m excited about the gas line because I like an underdog story,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy told conference attendees after standing in the back of the conference hall and watching Cannon’s presentation.
“(We’re) incredibly close. I’m not going to pop the champagne bottle until the contract (is) signed and there is pipe being built and welded.”

Glenfarne, an international energy company, bought 75% of the proposed AKLNG project from the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a state-owned firm, earlier this year. AGDC retains a 25% stake in the project.
Their joint venture is called 8 Star Alaska, referring to the eight stars on the Alaska flag.
Under the pipeline project’s latest plan, it would be built in two phases.
The first phase would involve building the pipeline itself along a route from the North Slope to the western side of Cook Inlet, where it would connect into the existing Anchorage-area gas distribution system.
That effort, planned for completion as soon as 2029, would be for in-state use. 
It would carry gas from either Point Thompson or an under-development oil and gas project near the Dalton Highway to southcentral Alaskans who are facing a shortage.
In February 2024, AGDC estimated that the first phase would cost at least $11 billion to construct.
A Glenfarne spokesperson said after Cannon’s presentation that the first phase could be constructed even if 8-Star doesn’t export gas to international customers.
“Phase 1 is core to solving Alaska’s natural gas crisis because it is both financially viable as an independent part of the project and vital to bringing Alaskan gas to global markets,” they said by email.
Phase 2 would involve the installation of a gas treatment plant on the North Slope, an export terminal on the Kenai Peninsula and compressor stations along the pipeline in order to increase the volume of gas that the pipeline can carry.
That is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars more.
The initial phase of the pipeline wouldn’t need the compressors because in-state demand is so much lower than what would be needed for export, Cannon said. 
That first phase also wouldn’t need the gas treatment plant — designed to strip carbon dioxide from the gas before shipment down the pipeline — because the initial gas sources to be used on the North Slope don’t contain much carbon dioxide.
Because the pipeline wouldn’t be built in time to prevent gas shortages in southcentral, Cannon said 8 Star intends to build a gas import facility at the site of its future export terminal.
The import terminal is one of three currently being planned for Cook Inlet. At a future date, Cannon said, the import terminal could be flipped to flow in the opposite direction and become part of the export facility.

For decades, the biggest obstacle to construction of a trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline has been its cost and the need to finance its construction.
In response to questions on Thursday, Cannon said the company is “working two fronts” when it comes to financing.
On one front, “We are working directly with the Department of Energy with their loan program office, and there’s some opportunities there,” Cannon said. 
On the other front, the company is seeking loans from banks and “institutional investor types to essentially fund a project where all the key contracts are in place.”
That would require 8 Star to sign contracts with utilities — either in Alaska or elsewhere — that are interested in buying gas from its pipeline.
At full capacity, the pipeline would carry 20 million tons of natural gas per year. 
“To date, where we are, is we have signed either letters of intent or essentially cooperation agreements with both PTT out of Thailand and CPC out of Taiwan to supply about 8 million tons of LNG. That leaves about 12 out of the 20 million tons per year capacity. We’re in negotiations right now for well more than those 12. Frankly, it’s going to be kind of a question of who gets there first.”
PTT and CPC are each state-owned oil and gas companies; neither country’s commitment is 100% firm yet.
South Korea and Japan have frequently been mentioned as possible customers for Alaska gas, but to date, neither country has committed. Earlier this week, Nikkei Asia interviewed experts who said they believe the cost of Alaska gas is likely too high for a deal anytime soon.
Cannon, speaking to attendees of the AOGA conference in Anchorage, was bullish on the prospects of a deal and said 8 Star is soliciting bids from companies that might supply the pipe that makes up the pipeline.
“Already, we’ve gone out to 15 different mills and suppliers from around the world, Asia, North America and Europe. We are in the middle of a selection process with prime contractors for pipeline construction,” he said. 
The company doesn’t have the pipeline’s full right of way secured, he said, but the company is “95% there on the right of way. What’s left on the right of way … is really either under negotiation or, I would say, well in hand. … A lot of the engineering has already been done. And of course, the permits are there.”
Cannon didn’t mention the possibility of litigation intended to slow or stop the project; every major oil and gas project in Alaska has faced lawsuits.
At the end of his presentation, Cannon signed a ceremonial agreement with the state and the federal government that involves the pipeline’s route through Denali National Park.
“As I’ve said before, it’s like Christmas every day,” Dunleavy said, referring to a prior comment praising the Trump administration. He then moved on to talking about the pipeline.
“This is just one example of the speed by which they’re moving, and it’s going to be an amazing five months.”

A new study shows that contrary to long-held scientific assumptions, wolves will move den sites to follow migrating prey. (Wyoming Game and Fish)Scientific research has long assumed gray wolves are non-migratory during springtime, staying anchored to tend to litters of nearly helpless pups. For the first weeks of life, after all, pups are blind, deaf and extremely vulnerable.
A game camera image captured in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, however, upends that assumption. In the picture, an adult female wolf hauls a squirmy-looking pup by its hindquarters. The collared female, GPS data shows, was transporting the youngster from a den site to a new pack “rendezvous” site — effectively relocating her young family.
The photograph is part of a study, “Wolves use diverse tactics to track partially migratory prey,” that sheds new light on the evolving dynamics between ungulates and the carnivores that prey on them.

The study, published Aug. 1 in the journal Current Biology, finds that canids with very young pups relocate homesites if their source of prey — in this case, elk — migrate.
The research helps illuminate the ways shifting ungulate migrations can impact predator behaviors and ecosystem dynamics, said senior author Arthur Middleton, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who has spent years researching ungulate migration and conservation in Wyoming.

“It’s sort of become pretty obvious to me that (ungulate migrations are) really important to the functioning of the ecosystem,” Middleton said. “But, we’ve had work to do to show how and why, and so I think this helps add another piece of that puzzle.”
This puzzle piece relates to the ways ungulate movements can directly influence the behavior of large carnivores. “That has broader implications, I think, for how we think about the migrations and why we’re trying to conserve them and things like that,” Middleton said.
  Tracking movements 

The research team set out in 2019 to learn about wolf predation in more granular detail, said co-author Avery Shawler. To do that, researchers partnered with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to put collars on both prey — nearly 100 members of the large Cody elk herd — as well as their predators — 19 wolves belonging to seven packs.
“So we were investigating wolf kill sites to see what they were killing and eating,” said Shawler, who completed her doctorate at the University of California – Berkeley in 2024.
This study area is east of Yellowstone National Park in the Absaroka Mountains, a rugged landscape home to high-alpine meadows, Douglas fir forests, aspen glades and sagebrush steppe.
During summer and winter seasons through 2021, scientists collected a great deal of data on the movement patterns of the animals, Shawler said.
That allowed researchers “to do movement analyses and compare GPS collar information,” she said. Through that, they realized “that different wolf packs have different strategies for tracking the Cody elk herd, which has individuals that migrate and individuals that don’t migrate.”
Wyoming Game and Fish game camera images helped bolster the collar observations.
Ultimate findings demonstrated that gray wolves use diverse movement tactics to track partially migratory elk. Some Yellowstone Ecosystem elk only migrate short distances in the spring, and the wolf packs that tracked them generally stayed in the territory where they first established their dens. Other elk travel longer springtime distances, and the wolf packs that tracked them went to greater lengths to keep close. That includes packs with pups shifting homesites to follow migratory elk to summer range. Sometimes they carried small pups as far as 20 kilometers from their original dens.
Because the highest source of wolf mortality can be attributed to members of other packs killing puppies, moving them is risky, Shawler said.
The relocation of small pups was not a surprise to Game and Fish biologists and other large carnivore specialists, Shawler and Middleton said. Experts have observed that behavior on the ground for years. The finer-scaled detail provided by GPS collars confirmed their observations.

But, Middleton said, these findings counter years of assumptions by the larger body of animal researchers that migratory ungulates can escape predation in spring because wolves are anchored to dens and their largely immobile pups. The study is the first time researchers outside of the Arctic have observed gray wolves shifting their territorial range to be closer to prey during pup-rearing season.
The game camera photo captured it perfectly, Shawler noted. “Once they got that camera trap photo, literally of an adult wolf carrying a pup that was really, really young  … It was like, ‘Oh, they actually are moving the pups, and that’s over some really rugged terrain, over a pretty long distance.’”
  Implications 

Previous work by Middleton illustrated that elk are highly variable and have the means to adapt to changing climate cues.
This study takes that a step further, Shawler said.
“There’s less research on how predators respond to that flexibility, and it would make sense that predators are also able to adapt,” she said. “So it’s just kind of adding to that literature.”
Understanding how wolves adapt to the prey’s behavior can help land managers better conserve both species, Middleton said. The study area, outside of Yellowstone National Park boundaries, encompasses human development like ranches and wilderness. That makes it a candidate for human-wildlife conflict.
Researchers generated a significant body of data, and Shawler is working to publish further work from it.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Alabama's state grocery tax will fall from 3% to 2% on Monday as the result of a law passed in the spring. (Kevin Hardy/Stateline)Alabama’s state grocery tax is scheduled to drop on Monday as a law passed last spring takes effect.
The state portion of the grocery tax will fall from 3% to 2%, the result of campaigning by both liberal and conservative groups.
“This is great news for the people of Alabama. The latest grocery tax reduction – the second in three years – will make it easier for every Alabamian to make ends meet, especially in this time of persistently high food prices,” said Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise, a civil rights advocacy organization that has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the tax.

HB 386, sponsored by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville and passed during the 2025 legislative session, does not directly impact grocery taxes imposed by city or county governments, though the law allows local governments to cut those taxes if they wish. It forbids local governments from raising them further.
A message was sent to the Alabama Grocers Association seeking comment.
Most states exempt groceries from sales taxes. Alabama for years was one of a handful of states that fully taxed groceries, and had done so since the state first imposed sales taxes in 1939. State and local levies combined could raise the tax as high as 10% in some areas. Critics said the tax fell disproportionately on lower-income earners and added to food insecurity.
A family that spends $600 on groceries each month and paid a total 9% tax will see their tax on the groceries go from $54 a month to $48 a month, or from $648 a year to $576 a year.
Legislators for years resisted cutting the grocery tax, citing the potential impact it could have on the Education Trust Fund budget (ETF), which pays for most public education in the state. The ETF gets most state sales taxes; HB 386 was estimated to reduce revenue in the ETF by $121 million.
But a surplus of money in 2023 led lawmakers to push for a reduction in the grocery tax. HB 479, sponsored by Garrett, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee and enacted in 2023, reduced the state grocery tax from 4%, the standard sales tax rate in the state, to 3%.
The bill opened the door for an additional reduction, but only if revenue in the ETF increased 3.5%. In the fall 2023, budget experts for the state forecasted tax receipts to increase by less than 2%.
Garrett, however, moved to reduce the tax last spring, saying a repeal of an income tax exemption on overtime wages would pay for the cut.
Even after reducing the state portion of the grocery tax bill in half, Alabama Arise is hoping for further reductions to eliminate the tax altogether.
“We continue to support our longstanding proposal to replace grocery tax revenue by capping or ending the state income tax deduction for federal income tax payments,” Hyden said. “Alabama is the only state to allow this full deduction, which overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest households. Closing this skewed loophole would protect funding for public schools and ensure Alabama can afford to end the state sales tax on groceries forever.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Man-walking-through-grocery-aisle-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-31 08:56:34.805558

Independence on Rollerblades

These shoes feel like wings. 
I am
f l y i n g
across the newly grooved pavement, balancing
on pink wheels and scraped knees and a perfect morning,
whispering, You won’t fall. Someday I will glide straight
into the White House and spin around
with my arms out wide as the changing leaves swirl golden
around me. I’ll write my own declaration
right then and there, in my wrist guards and helmet,
my name scrawled at the bottom in big, looping letters,
like the gentle curves of my body as I skate
toward freedom
and f a l l.

The members of the Windham Southeast Education Association would like to publicly support our community’s bus drivers and monitors who have been locked out by F.M. Kuzmeskus (a subsidiary of anti-union and out-of-town Beacon Mobility, which is owned by the giant hedge fund Audax). 
Our Teamsters 597 bus drivers and monitors — who are professionals who put the safety of our students first — are seeking a contract with equitable and timely pay. Kuzmeskus’ decision to cease bargaining, lock out our union siblings and hire out-of-town personnel to drive buses is unacceptable and unfair to the local drivers and monitors that our students and parents trust. 
In fact, it’s unfair and unacceptable for our community as a whole.
We ask that F.M. Kuzmeskus return to the bargaining table in good faith and stay there. We ask that they swiftly resolve a contract that will support the essential work of safely transporting our students to and from school.
We ask the community to contact Travel Kuzmeskus and urge them to return to the bargaining table in good faith for a swift resolution. Additionally, please contact our school board to voice your concern in regards to our contracted bus provider. The safety of our students demands no less.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.












We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office




State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Getty Images)A law requiring parental consent for almost any medical treatment provided to minors went into effect in Idaho in July 2024, and it has been hampering children’s access to care in unintended ways.
One of the affected entities is the Idaho 988 Crisis and Suicide Hotline.
More than 1,500 Idahoans between the ages of 5 and 17 contacted the hotline between when the parental consent law went into effect on July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, according to data provided by the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline.
Some of those young people can’t move forward in their call without a parent giving permission.
Sometimes, a parent or guardian can get on the phone, according to Idaho 988 Director Lee Flinn, “but in most situations, the minor hangs up because they tell us they feel like they can’t do that.”
“We really do want and hope that minors have a parent or two parents that support them, but one of the things that we hear sometimes is that they don’t have a parent they can talk to,” Flinn said.



How you can get help
Call or text 988 to talk to a trained crisis counselor. Phone services are provided in English and Spanish, with translator services available for 250 other languages. Text services are only provided in English. For online messaging, visit suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.
A trained crisis counselor will listen to you, understand how your problem is affecting you, provide support and share resources, if needed.
Crisis Text Line is a texting service for emotional crisis support. To speak with a trained listener, text HELLO to 741741. It is free, available 24/7, and confidential. 			


She emphasized that the hotline still accepts calls from anyone, and encourages people of any age to call, text or chat online if they are in crisis.
Definition of emergency can complicate how Idaho hotline staff handle call from minor
The law, Senate Bill 1329, passed in 2024, requires that a provider receive consent from a parent or legal custodian to perform any “health care service,” which is defined as “for the diagnosis, screening, examination, prevention, treatment, cure, care, or relief of any physical or mental health condition, illness, injury, defect, or disease.”
Providers do not need parental consent if they’ve been given blanket consent by a parent already or the provider “reasonably determines that a medical emergency exists and furnishing the health care service is necessary to prevent death or imminent, irreparable physical injury to the minor child.”
Lee said many of the calls received by hotline staff members are “really serious, they are in crisis,” but the situation doesn’t meet the high bar defined in the law.
The law has also impeded the hotline’s ability to follow-up with young people, which is considered a best practice regardless of the severity of the situation, she said.
“If a teenager tells us they are suicidal but they’re not at imminent risk, meaning they may not have a plan, they may not have access to lethal means, they’re still feeling suicidal and it is best practice … to offer a follow up call the next day within 24 hours,” Flinn said. “And we’re not able to offer that follow up call or support to minors because of this law.”
If there is imminent risk determined, the call will continue and the responder will try to ensure the minor’s safety, she said.
Alexander Copple, who worked at the hotline as a responder as part of a master’s of social work internship between July 2024 and May, 2025, said the law made it difficult to do what he felt was right.
“We can hear a little bit, and then we would basically say, ‘we can’t continue the conversation  unless you have a parent there who can give consent,’ and then we’d have to end the call,” Copple said. “And we have no way of knowing or following up to know if there was any help or support that was received.”
Flinn said young people can call for a variety of reasons, often stemming from a difficulty managing strong emotions related to bullying, their relation with their parents, pressure to succeed, or a breakup.
“A young person’s brain is not fully developed into their 20s, so when a young person is in crisis, it’s important to remember that they can be very impulsive sometimes, so the best support that any of us can provide a young person, early on in the crisis, is best.”
Idaho lawmakers say they intend to try again to clarify the law
The bill sponsors, Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, and Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, were aware of other ways the law was impeding access to care, and Anthon during the 2025 legislative session proposed a bill to clarify language in it, but the bill did not advance in the House.
Ehardt told the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday that she hadn’t heard of the law’s impact on the hotline. 
“The one thing I’ve said from the beginning, is that we wanted to keep an an eye on things pertaining to suicide,” Ehardt said. “… I think that’s worth looking at.”
Anthon’s bill proposed this year would have created a specific exception for the 988 hotline, allowing for services without parental consent if the child is “is accessing the services of the Idaho crisis and suicide hotline or experiencing a mental health crisis and presents an imminent risk of serious injury to self or others.”
The law as it’s written had also caused problems for those providing sexual assault exams on young people under 18. Under the law, a health worker would need to get consent from a parent to do the exam, but in some cases the perpetrator of the assault may be that parent or another family member, Idaho Reports previously reported.
The law also gained national attention when the Washington Post reported on a 13-year-old pregnant girl from McCall who could consent to her baby’s care but not her own. 
The law came up at a recent legislative Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force meeting, during which advocates disagreed as to whether the law, as written, hampered abuse investigations and treatment, the Sun reported.
Before the passage of Senate Bill 1329, teenagers 14 and older could seek contraception or other family planning services outside of abortion, treatment and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and inpatient care for mental health, the Idaho Press reported. Those 16 and older may consent to treatment or rehabilitation for substance abuse.
Children’s advocates at the time of the bill’s passage expressed concern it would have a “chilling effect” on young people’s access to health care, the Idaho Press reported.
Ehard’t seatmate, fellow Idaho Falls Republican Marco Erickson, had originally raised concerns about the impact on crisis and suicide centers when the bill was introduced in 2024. Erickson is a program director at Community Youth in Action, which works toward substance abuse and suicide prevention.
He told the Sun that he had heard the bill had been impacting services at the hotline, and he’s been advocating for those who are affected to bring potential solutions to the bill sponsors.
Erickson did not sponsor the bill, and although he expressed concerns about the mental health aspect of the bill, he voted for it on the floor.
“I’m just, in good faith, hoping they take care of it,” he said. “… (Ehardt) assured me that these issues would be addressed.”
Ehardt has said she believes the law has been “misconstrued” and overly broadly interpreted in a way that doesn’t allow for some basic services to be provided, such as a Band-Aid at school, but said she’s open to trying to clarify it.
The bill last year passed the Senate but never went anywhere in the House. Ehardt said it came too late in the session. She hopes to have a bill ready early in the 2026 session.
“Some of those things are being worked on as we speak,” she said.

But President Trump has indicated he wants to pull back on giving states this type of support. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)For years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleanians made the Federal Emergency Management Agency the butt of their bitter jokes.
Anti-FEMA sentiment was so high in Louisiana that local businesses started selling T-shirts a couple of months after the storm lampooning the federal agency with slogans like “Where’s FEMA?” and “FEMA stands for Federal Employees Missing in Action”.
The sentiment is understandable. Almost a half dozen federal investigations launched in the six months after Hurricane Katrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005 – and turned into the country’s most catastrophic natural disaster – determined FEMA failed in nearly every way to respond to the storm.

“Hurricane Katrina exposed flaws in the structure of FEMA and DHS that are too substantial to mend,” concluded a 2006 U.S. Senate report titled “Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared.”
Yet 20 years after the agency’s feckless Katrina response, some Louisiana leaders find themselves in the awkward position of having to defend FEMA.
President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants the federal government to play less of a role in natural disaster response, raising concerns that state and local governments might need to cover more of their recovery costs.
Such a change would likely affect Louisiana more than almost every other state in the country.
Since Katrina, Louisiana has received more public and individual assistance from FEMA ($12.6 billion) than all states but Florida ($16.6 billion) and New York ($19.4 billion), according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which tracks federal disaster spending.
The money helped Louisiana respond to 25 extreme weather events, including 11 hurricanes, six floods and one ice storm, over the past two decades.
That FEMA figure doesn’t account for all of the money Louisiana has received in the wake of Katrina. There was another $11 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went to the Road Home program to rebuild housing. All told, the federal government put an unprecedented $76 billion toward Louisiana’s recovery from the 2005 storm.
Louisiana simply wouldn’t be able to handle the financial burden of major disaster response without significant support from the federal government, according to several former state officials interviewed. Storms with far less impact than Katrina have the ability to overwhelm the state’s assets, they said.
If Louisiana has to worry about covering more disaster recovery costs, the state will have less money to spend on schools, universities, roads, bridges and economic development.
“If we didn’t have the federal money, we would be in a terrible mess, and we would have been in a terrible mess from Katrina going forward,” said Jay Dardenne, Louisiana’s former lieutenant governor and state budget chief for former Gov. John Bel Edwards.

Uncertainty at FEMA
To what extent Trump will pull back on federal disaster assistance isn’t clear.
As recently as June, the president said he would push to eliminate FEMA altogether. He then backed off that rhetoric after July 4th weekend flooding in Texas killed at least 136 people, including children attending a sleepaway camp. His administration’s response was directly criticized.
Still, the Trump administration has already made several preliminary changes to FEMA that alarm emergency response experts. The agency has reduced staff and some of those who remain have been asked to help with hiring immigration enforcement agents instead of working on disaster relief.
The FEMA cuts come on top of those to the National Hurricane Center and other federal programs that provide crucial information to hurricane-prone states and help them ready for incoming storms.
Some reforms Congress enacted in the year after Katrina to strengthen FEMA have also been ignored. A law requiring FEMA’s director to have experience in emergency response and disaster recovery isn’t being followed. Trump’s acting FEMA administrator David Richardson previously oversaw counter terrorism programs but does not have natural disaster management experience.
There are also concerns about whether a new policy delayed assistance during the Texas flood, similar to what unfolded in the aftermath of Katrina.
Due to a bureaucratic breakdown 20 years ago, FEMA failed to promptly provide boats for search-and-rescue teams in New Orleans, even after federal officials knew flooding was widespread, according to a U.S. Senate report from 2006.
This past July, several questions were raised about whether search-and-rescue teams were delayed during the Texas flood because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem now requires every FEMA contract over $100,000 to be approved personally by her,  the Associated Press reported. The Trump administration has denied those allegations.

The ability of Louisiana and other states to respond to catastrophic weather with their own staff would also likely be impacted if Trump changes the traditional funding reimbursements for recovery efforts.
“The federal government will have a lasting role in responding to and funding the impact of disasters; local and state governments simply do not have the resources to do so,” said Paul Rainwater, who was executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority that managed federal funding for state rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina. He went on to serve as former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s chief of staff and budget czar.
“The question the Trump administration faces, given some of its comments about FEMA, is: When will a White House step in and help?” he said.
Presidential discretion
The president has a significant say in when FEMA provides funding to states after natural disasters, as well as how much money states or local governments receive.
When a state is overwhelmed by a catastrophic event, a governor makes a formal request of the president for federal assistance. FEMA starts to provide help to the state authorities after it is granted.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has denied disaster relief that was expected to be approved. His decisions have affected liberal-leaning states such as Maryland and Washington and more conservative ones like West Virginia.
He even stalled for a month on accepting a disaster declaration from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who personally knows Trump and served as his press secretary during his first term as president.
As president, Trump has the ability to not only approve federal assistance, but to also increase the share of the state or local costs that FEMA will reimburse. For example, federal law gives presidents the discretion to reduce or waive the requirement for a state or local government to cover 25% of the cost of debris removal after a storm.
Louisiana has benefited from a reduction of these local financial responsibilities for nine weather events in the past 25 years, including for hurricanes Ida (2021), Laura (2020), Ike (2008), Gustav (2008), Rita (2005), Katrina (2005) and Ivan (2004). The 2016 Baton Rouge-area floods and a severe ice storm in 2001 were also approved for enhanced federal assistance, according to a 2023 Congressional report.
But all the upheaval should be a signal to local and state officials to prepare as if that extra FEMA help might not be coming their way, former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, who worked for President Joe Biden, said in a call with reporters this week.
“There are, right now, a lot of questions about whether any of those costs are going to be eligible for reimbursement,” Criswell said. “You need to put plans in place to make sure that you can do it, regardless of whether you get federal support.”
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he personally advocated for the federal government to cover more disaster recovery bills after Hurricane Laura, which hit Southwest Louisiana, and the 2016 flooding.
Sometimes a disaster is so profound that local governments have a hard time coming up with the tax revenue to cover their share of the recovery. If people lose their homes and are displaced, as happened after Katrina, cities and parishes won’t have much money to put toward cleanup, Cassidy said.
“When you destroy a community, you destroy their ability to raise tax money,” he said in an interview.
Jindal, who served as Louisiana’s governor from 2008-16 and was a congressman during Hurricane Katrina, said he thinks the federal government will always be an important partner in major disasters. But states and local governments should take on more responsibility for smaller events.
“There are many day-to-day disasters that many state and local governments can handle themselves,” Jindal said. “For the bigger disasters that can overwhelm, you still want to have some federal role.”
It’s also crucial that local and state officials know what to expect from the federal government so they can be prepared, said Jindal, who was governor when hurricanes Gustav and Ike hit Louisiana.
“I think it’s important to have clear rules ahead of time,” he said.

Landry: Louisiana shouldn’t worry about FEMA
Trump may have denied disaster relief to other states, but Gov. Jeff Landry said Louisiana has nothing to worry about when it comes to FEMA because of his good relationship with the administration.
“I think it’s all just a bunch of media hype trying to scare people. We’re ready for hurricane season,” the governor told reporters this week.
Landry has a close relationship with Noem and said Trump’s homeland security leader has already responded to requests for assistance for matters in Lake Charles and Terrebonne Parish this year.
“What Kristi Noem has done lately, I mean, we just call her, and we say, ‘These are projects that need to be moved,’” Landry said.
Louisiana is one of only a few states that has a local representative on Trump’s FEMA review council, which is supposed to make recommendations on reforming the agency this fall.
One of the council’s 12 members, who include Noem and Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is Louisiana native Mark Cooper, Jindal’s former head of emergency management and former Gov. Edwards’ chief of staff.
“Obviously, Louisiana is playing a big role in this reimagining for FEMA,” Cooper said this week in an interview from Oklahoma where the review council was meeting. “We’re being heard. Louisiana is being heard as part of this process.”
Cooper said the council already met directly with Louisiana emergency response officials in the Landry administration. It held its second public meeting in New Orleans in July at his suggestion.
The council has made no decisions about whether FEMA’s reimbursement policies for state and local governments should change, Cooper said, but he suggested more might be asked of states.
“We need to do more to help states to be more self-reliant and resilient,” he said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-31 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Labor Day is a time for Mississippi politicians to praise workers. But when will they send more help?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/31/labor-day-health-coverage-workers/,"Column: If politicians continue to refuse to expand Medicaid, the number of Mississippians with no health insurance will rise in the coming years.","‘Tis the season — Labor Day weekend — when state politicians will trip over each other to praise Mississippi workers.
And they rightfully should sing the praises of the state’s workforce — the entire workforce, those at the top of the pay scale and those at the bottom. Mississippi has a lot of dedicated workers.
But it also tis the season when various organizations evaluate the working conditions of each state.
According to Oxfam, a nonprofit that promotes equality, Mississippi is 51st (including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico) in its most recent ranking of best states to work. The ranking that was released last week is determined based on 27 factors related to wages, worker protection and the right to organize.
Mississippi’s low ranking can be attributed to a number of factors, such as being among the 20 states that have not increased the minimum wage, the lack of paid family leave, low unemployment benefits and a weak equal pay law.
Another factor that is harmful to thousands of Mississippi workers is the refusal of state leaders to take steps to ensure they have adequate health care. Mississippi is one of 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid, as is allowed under federal law, to provide health insurance coverage for the working poor.
Mississippi politicians often have said that instead of expanding Medicaid, they wanted to ensure good jobs that offer health insurance as a benefit.
How is that plan working out for Mississippi workers?
Medicaid expansion has been available for states to opt into for more than a decade. When Medicaid expansion started, Mississippi had one of the nation’s lowest percentage of workers receiving health insurance coverage through their employer.
Guess what?
Mississippi is still near the bottom in terms of the percentage of its workforce with employer-provided health insurance. According to 2023 data compiled by KFF, which conducts health research, just 42.7% of Mississippi workers have employer-based health insurance compared to the national average of 48.6%.
KFF research also reveals that 10.5% of Mississippians have no health insurance at all, compared to the national average of 7.9%.
If political leaders continue to refuse to expand Medicaid and anticipated federal changes play out, the number of Mississippians with no health insurance is expected to rise in the coming years.
Enhanced federal subsidies provided during the Joe Biden administration for health insurance purchased on the federal marketplace exchange are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Congress opted not to continue the enhanced subsidies as part of President Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Without the enhanced subsidies, KFF estimates the average cost of a policy for the 338,000 Mississippians who have insurance through the marketplace exchange will increase $480 per year, which could be cost prohibitive for someone working in a convenience store or waiting tables or cutting grass.
Experts predict fewer people — fewer Mississippi workers — will have health insurance in the coming years because of the federal action to allow the enhanced subsidies to expire and the state’s inaction of not expanding Medicaid.
Roy Mitchell, executive director of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, said federal studies estimate 170,000 Mississippians will not be able to continue their marketplace plan once the enhanced federal subsidies expire at the end of 2025.
That could result in more sick Mississippians, meaning fewer people in the workforce for state politicians to praise.
Yes, ’tis the season to celebrate Mississippi workers.
But when is the season to provide real health care relief for Mississippi’s low wage workers?

Windsor Superior Court Judge H. Dickson Corbett issued a ruling this month preventing the Village of Woodstock from hiring a new police chief. 
In his Aug. 7 ruling, Corbett signaled that the court likely will ultimately rule in favor of the former police chief, Joe Swanson, in his $5 million civil lawsuit against the village.  
Swanson sued the village in early May after the municipal manager, Eric Duffy, and the Board of Village Trustees demoted Swanson from police chief to police officer. At the heart of his lawsuit, Swanson claimed that village trustees did not follow state law, by establishing proper cause, when they removed him from office. 
When Swanson filed the suit, he also asked the court to step in and offer a preliminary injunction, an intervention that would stop the village from hiring a new chief pending future court orders. 
To grant Swanson’s request to step in, the court needed evidence that Woodstock’s hiring of a new police chief would cause Swanson irreparable harm — and Corbett reasoned the case met that threshold. Chris O’Keefe has been serving as interim chief and can remain in that post, according to the decision.
In his reasoning, Corbett signaled that the court will likely rule in Swanson’s favor down the line. 
“It appears that the village trustees failed to apply the correct legal standard before removing petitioner (Swanson) from the office of police chief,” Corbett wrote in the injunction ruling. 
While the injunction did not decide the merits or final outcome of the case, it did offer a prediction based on the court’s review of evidence submitted with the request for injunction, Corbett wrote.
“It appears from that review that the decision of the trustees will be reversed because the trustees did not apply the correct legal standard when making their decision,” he wrote. 
Linda Fraas, Swanson’s attorney, said the ruling was a “very promising sign.” 
The saga started in October after Swanson’s husband got into a verbal altercation with another driver during a traffic incident while Swanson was a passenger in the car. A citizen complaint was filed against Swanson regarding the incident. 
Two separate investigations following the incident found that Swanson did not commit wrongdoing. One of those investigations was conducted by the Vermont State Police and the other was by the Vermont Criminal Justice Council, according to court documents.  
Despite the results of those investigations, Duffy hired a private investigator to interview police department employees about Swanson’s conduct, said Jeffrey Kahn, vice chair of the Board of Village Trustees. Duffy declined to comment on the case. 
After those interviews, Duffy decided to demote Swanson to police officer. Then, the trustees had a quasi judicial hearing to decide if they would support that decision. The hearing, made public per Swanson’s request, went on for more than 14 hours. 
During that hearing, “there was a preponderance of testimony by both police officers as well as dispatchers that it became clear that the chief did not have support within either department,” Khan said. 
Without that support, the trustees reasoned it was best for the community to remove Swanson as chief, Khan said. 
“The trustees’ interest throughout this has been what’s in the best interest of the municipality,” he said. 
Vermont law offers certain tenure protections to police chiefs — and the village has to meet certain criteria to remove them from office, Corbett wrote. In line with past interpretations of the law, the village would have to prove Swanson was “negligent or derelict” in his duties, engaged in “conduct unbecoming an officer” or was otherwise unable to perform his job, Corbett wrote. 
The trustees reasoned they didn’t need to meet that criteria because they weren’t firing Swanson altogether, they were merely demoting him. 
But chiefs hold a distinct rank, Corbett wrote, and removing anyone from that position requires that the village meet the legal criteria. 
“It validates what we’ve been saying all along, that this process was not correct,” said Fraas, Swanson’s attorney. 
Despite the court’s injunction, and the village’s subsequent inability to hire a new chief, the department is running smoothly with O’Keefe in the interim job, Khan said.
Corbett wrote that from his review of evidence submitted with the injunction, the case will likely be passed back down to the board of trustees. At that point, trustees would decide whether to remove Swanson as chief, within the bounds of state law.

The decision came as both towns are negotiating contracts with their individual police unions and after months of slow-moving police governance meetings between members of the towns' respective selectboards.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on Aug. 28, 2025.
Hinesburg will be ending its shared police agreement with Richmond on Sept. 8.
Although the towns have not ruled out the possibility of working together on policing in the future, the current breakdown reveals just how complicated it may be for communities to move toward regional systems for services.
The decision by the Hinesburg Selectboard on Aug. 20 to end the inter-municipal contracts for shared policing services and a shared chief came as both towns are negotiating contracts with their individual police unions and after months of slow-moving police governance meetings between members of the selectboards from each town.
According to Hinesburg Town Manager Todd Odit, the catalyst for ending the agreements was two-fold.
Back in the spring, Odit was approached by Hinesburg police officers about receiving reciprocal coverage from Richmond. At that time, Hinesburg was responsible for covering police services in Richmond whenever the Richmond officer was off duty or unavailable. Although both departments were understaffed, Richmond was not responsible for providing services in Hinesburg.
While the towns last week came to an agreement for reciprocal coverage — since July 1 the Richmond officer has been providing policing services in Hinesburg when there are no officers from the Hinesburg department — the Richmond selectboard agreed to start paying its only officer, Matthew Cohen, time-and-a-half when providing those services.
Although Hinesburg has been paying its officers a $500 monthly stipend for covering Richmond, the increase to Cohen’s pay when working in Hinesburg may have created new inequity between the two towns.
The issues with moving forward with shared policing go beyond the potential for pay inequities, however, not least of which is that the towns have been unable to land on what kind of system they want.
The police governance committee first convened in April after the contract for shared chief services fell apart with the departure of the former Hinesburg police chief, Anthony Cambridge. Cambridge resigned as chief in January, seeking employment with Richmond, which effectively ended the agreement — Richmond opted not to hire Cambridge, who has since found employment as a police chief in Wolf Point, Montana, according to the Northern Plains Independent.
The initial goal of the committee, which has met every other week, was to hammer out a new policing contract for the foreseeable future, but also to discuss long-term planning for how the departments may function in the years to come, including the possibility of a unified police district, a separate municipal entity that would receive oversight from members of both towns similar to how a school district operates.
“If we can get to an inter-municipal district at some point, that would be great, and yes, that certainly would have to go to the voters,” Mike Loner, selectboard member from Hinesburg, said at the governance meeting on Monday August 25. “But we keep having this conversation every time we come together, and we’re just spinning our wheels.”
Over the last few months, the committee has been focused on finding an interim shared chief who could help guide the process, whether the goal was a unified district, continued reciprocity, or the folding of one department into the other. It is unclear whether any viable candidates were ever brought forward.
Even without a shared chief or a long-term goal, in the back-and-forth conversations over the current contract and a future system, union negotiations were one of the largest sticking points.
“I think in reality, one town providing police coverage to another town isn’t going to be possible until both towns get through their collective bargaining process,” Odit said at the recent governance meeting.
While both towns are in contract negotiations, they’re starting from different places. Hinesburg only recently unionized and entered bargaining; Richmond is renegotiating its last union contract. Cohen was able to leverage that current contract to start receiving time and a half in Hinesburg — it contains a clause for extra pay for “contracted work.”
However, in negotiations, Hinesburg officers do not currently have that power.
“With the discrepancies between the two unions on pay, I don’t know where we can go into short term unless we solve that somehow,” Josh Arneson, the town manager in Richmond, said.
In part, the concern is that the negotiations will move out of sync with each other. The towns could end up with contracts that maintain or worsen current inequities between the departments, making it more difficult should the departments ever consolidate.
“One of the things we’re dealing with now is that the employees currently know where they work, what they’re doing, what the rules are, anything other than that is an unknown. And you know, most people don’t like unknowns” Odit said, suggesting that, should the towns decide on a long-term goal, each town might have to outline the process in their collective bargaining agreements.
Unless both unions agree to a certain amount of information sharing between the officers and the towns in the bargaining process, the differences will likely continue, and the roadblocks may remain.
For now, the governance committee has suspended meetings until the towns themselves decide whether a unified district is the goal.

LEBANON, N.H. — Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center has begun another multimillion-dollar expansion of its five-story patient pavilion.
The expansion is set to double the 64 beds currently in use in that section of the hospital, Tom Manion, the medical center’s chief operating officer, said in a Thursday video interview.

There are currently 460 inpatient beds in the medical center, according to Dartmouth Health spokesperson Cassidy Smith.
“We do have patients that we’re not able to serve because we’re at capacity,” Manion said.
Following the 240,000-square-foot pavilion’s opening in 2023, this expansion, which began in April, is set to be carried out over yearslong phases on two currently empty floors of the building.
After the final phase of the project, which is planned for 2028, the medical center will be able to admit an additional 4,500 inpatients annually, Manion said. Compared to current rates, this would be an increase of around 12% to 14%, Smith wrote in an email Thursday.
With an aging New Hampshire population, currently the second-oldest state in the nation, the departments set to expand are those that older adults need most: cardiovascular, neurology, oncology, transplant, surgery and general medicine.

Of the 64 new beds, 32 will expand the cardiovascular department, David Duncan, the vice president of facilities management for Dartmouth Health, said on Thursday’s call.
The cardiovascular expansion “is directly related to the age and population,” Duncan said. “As people get older, there’s more heart issues.”
The 32 other new beds will be a combination of neurology and general medicine beds, Duncan said. The particular department of the beds isn’t set in stone, as they can change based on the current needs of the population.
The expansion will also place related departments beside one another, so patients and staff can easily respond to changing needs. For example, the intensive care unit will be relocated to the third floor beside the specialty care unit, which is one step down in severity from intensive care, allowing for movement based on patients’ needs, Manion said.
Locating related units neighboring each other also allows for more “collaborative care” between different levels of physicians and nurses, according to Manion.
Despite health care workforce shortages, medical center officials “feel pretty comfortable in general about the direction we’re heading,” Manion wrote in a Wednesday email. “We have offers made, we have staff coming, etc. But we have some more recruiting to do.”

On a national stage, North Carolina often serves as a state to watch for its purple and swingy political nature. However, its own citizens are opting out of civic engagement at higher rates than most of the country, according to the 2024 Civic Health Index. Ineffective civics education could be part of the problem.
Independence High School junior April Alonso knows this firsthand. She struck out the first time she tried getting her fellow students at the Charlotte school to pre-register to vote.
For her AP Government & Politics class, Alonso had to do a service project. So, she enlisted a group of friends to walk around the cafeteria at lunchtime and get 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register.
They could not have been less interested, she said.
“They seemed pretty uncertain,” Alonso said. “It kind of felt like, if I were to make them register to vote, they would go down a drain or something. Like they acted like it was some kind of punishment.”
The second time around, Alonso sweetened the deal. Anyone who pre-registered would get a few pieces of candy. Suddenly, she had buy-in.
Brandon Rivers has also encountered his fair share of seemingly apathetic students in his time as executive director of the Charlotte Democracy Center, a nonpartisan organization focusing on voter education, specifically in marginalized communities.
Rivers spends a lot of time giving classroom presentations on voting before offering pre-registration to students.
Sometimes, students tell him they’re not interested. Rivers isn’t deterred; he asks them what they care about. Making money? Well, the state government sets tax policy and minimum wage, so they might want to pay attention to that. A safe neighborhood? The city council decides how much to pay local police officers and firefighters, as well as how much to budget for street lighting, so they may be interested in voting in that election.
Bridging the connection between students’ interests and government policy is key to getting them motivated to vote, Rivers said. Making the lesson interesting is also imperative; he’s competing with students’ phones and friends for attention.
Right now, the distractions and disconnect may be winning. According to the 2024 Civic Health Index, North Carolina lags behind most of the country on several key markers of civic engagement.
Turnout in the 2022 midterm elections and voter registration fell short of the national average. North Carolinians regularly discussed political and social issues with friends, families and neighbors less often than in most states. In several areas — participation in public meetings, contacting public officials and frequent consumption of political news — the state placed in the bottom 10 in the nation.
While there could be a host of reasons for North Carolina’s relative disengagement, one factor is at the center of it all: civic education, or the lack thereof.
Civic education teaches students how their government works, and their place in it. If done well, it arms them with the knowledge, confidence and motivation to participate in their local communities, and demonstrates the influence they can have in governmental decision making.
But too often, civic education is pushed to the side to make way for other priorities, and what instruction remains may be watered down to avoid conflict.
This article is the first in Civics Unlearned, a three-part investigative series from Carolina Public Press that explores how, and to what extent, a deprioritization of formal civic education has led to a generation of disengaged and polarized North Carolinians.
This article discusses the problem — civic engagement is relatively low in North Carolina, particularly among youth, and formal civic education doesn’t appear to be doing its part to bolster participation. As a result, public policy only represents a portion of the populace, and a generation of North Carolinians are growing up unprepared to work with each other and their government to solve community problems.
The second article explores how conflicting priorities and inconsistent delivery have hamstrung quality civic education. The final article suggests ways to bolster civic education and engagement, both within and beyond the formal education system.
‘It’s really just the Wild West’

In 1997, North Carolina public leaders sensed a looming crisis. They worried that North Carolina’s civic education was inadequate, and would lead to a generation of citizens unprepared to lead their communities.
So they worked with the North Carolina Civic Education Consortium, within the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s School of Government, to develop a report on the state’s civic health.
The report, published in 2003, centered around a phone survey of 800 teens and 800 adults, found that household income was the best predictor of civic engagement. Wealthier adults and students from high-income families were more likely to have worked with others to solve a community issue, discussed political issues at home, contacted public officials and showed interest in voting, among other civic activities.
Two decades later, these patterns persist. White North Carolinians report greater engagement than their Black counterparts in every indicator of civic health besides participation in public meetings. College-educated citizens also surged ahead of citizens with less formal education, and North Carolinians 30 and older reported significantly higher involvement than younger generations.
Education in civics should level the playing field, in theory. But, it isn’t.
North Carolina’s civic education is inconsistently taught, said Burke Middle College civics and personal finance teacher Timothy Barnsback.
“It’s really just the Wild West,” he said. “You have either great civics teachers or not-great civics teachers, and there’s not a whole lot of middle ground. It takes being passionate about it to actually make it a really meaningful course for students.”
Barnsback has been teaching social studies since 2000. He started with middle school, where the curriculum was more about rote knowledge and less about active civic engagement. But now that he teaches high school seniors, he makes an effort to make his instruction more interactive and student-focused.
He doesn’t have to do that. North Carolina’s standards are very flexible — it comes down to how much each individual teacher is willing to invest in their students. Not every teacher has the desire or resources to do so.
There’s some truth to the stereotype that coaches with minimal background in the subect matter are often also assigned the social studies class, Barnsback said. In his years of helping create professional development resources for social studies teachers, he’s noticed a trend of male teachers not specifically trained to teach social studies who bounce between history and civics on the one hand and physical education on the other, depending on where they can get a coaching job.
To exacerbate matters, the state does not designate funding for civic education or service-learning projects, according to an open records request.
While a $120,000 character education budget exists, professional development competes with various other priorities for the relatively small pool of money.
In practice, professional development is “do it yourself and handle it at the local level,” Barnsback said.
“So there’s not a depth of knowledge, and to be honest, there’s not a real investment in teaching it properly,” he added.
Vague state standards
When Rockingham Early College High School social studies teacher Valencia Abbott gets to the lesson about the roles, powers and functions of different types of local governments, she conducts a special assignment called, “Who represents me?”
She divides her students into groups based on their addresses, and has them search for their mayor, town council and other local representatives. Then, she shows them how they can contact these officials if they ever want to bring up an issue or offer their input.

Regardless of whether her students stay in Rockingham County, the lesson will stick with them, Abbott said.
“These are the things that we do in our system that we have, and they know the steps, and then they’ll be less hesitant next time with that,” she said.
While Abbott chooses to connect the standard to real-life civic engagement, she could just as easily present a Powerpoint on the various levels of local government and call it a day. Teaching is very personal, she said; everyone will approach it differently, and trying to enforce any level of uniformity is likely to be a futile exercise.
“I’m going to do my job to the best of my ability, despite my little paycheck every month, but I also know that there are teachers who come in and do the bare minimum every day,” she said.
That doesn’t mean the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction doesn’t try to develop effective content standards.
In 2021, DPI revised the standards, which serve as a guide for local educational authorities as they develop curriculum for their districts.
While North Carolina’s standards integrate civics into broader social studies instruction beginning in kindergarten, no stand-alone civics course exists until high school.
By second grade, students are supposed to be able to “exemplify ways individuals and groups shape communities and contribute to the making of rules and laws,” according to the state standards. In fourth grade, students should be preparing to be “responsible and informed citizens” by studying the state Constitution and separation of powers.
In eighth grade, North Carolinians delve into the founding documents and ideals of the state and nation, and should be able to “use a range of civic approaches to address problems being investigated.”
If this all seems vague to you, you’re not alone.
After the 2021 standards were released, North Carolina earned a failing grade from the conservative educational think tank Fordham Institute, which found the content, rigor, clarity and organization of the standards lacking. The report pulled no punches.
“Grades three and four target state and local government, but not in a way that is likely to promote understanding.”
“…the civics standards for (fifth) grade provide dubious guidance.”
“Here, again, the standards tease big concepts… but offer nothing concrete.”
“Finally, although the inquiry strand includes a category on ‘taking informed action,’ it is thoroughly uninspiring.”
The STEM-first mentality
When Nicole Clarke, a social studies teacher at Vance County’s Clarke Elementary school, came to the U.S. from Jamaica to teach, she quickly realized social studies played second fiddle to math and reading. There was more small group time and interventions in those prioritized subjects.
Teachers take note of the hierarchy.
“Because it’s not a tested subject, and much focus is not placed on it, then people don’t tend to put their all into it like they would do for literacy and math and science,” Clarke said.
Rowan-Salisbury Middle School social studies teacher Eric Shock has heard the same from his peers teaching younger North Carolinians. They tell him that “the STEM mentality” pushes subjects like social studies to the side.
“Elementary teachers will tell me, ‘Oh, well, we include social studies when we’re doing reading activities and we incorporate it that way,’” Shock said. “ But it’s not direct, purposeful social studies instruction. It is reading instruction with a social studies article.”
As a result, Shock’s eighth-graders often have wildly different starting points when they arrive in his class; some are beginning at zero, while others have been extensively taught and tested on their civic knowledge.
Even when they get there, sometimes the class is not their main concern.
“I’ve had students who have come in and said, ‘Well, I’ve got to get my math grade up because I’ve got the (end-of-grade exam),’ or, ‘I’m not feeling really good in science right now, and, that’s a tested subject,’ and I’ve heard parents say that before too,” Shock said,
He feels like social studies has become a “glorified exploratory class,” in line with music or P.E. Meanwhile, robust civics instruction is as important as ever, he said. It teaches students how to critically think.
“With the rise of social media, my classroom, social studies teachers’ classrooms, we are the front line in the war against misinformation,” Shock said. “We’re the front line in the war against bias.”
Broken civic education
Civic education is broken, and has been for decades, according to a book co-authored by Duke political science professor Sunshine Hillygus.
The goal of civic education is to develop civic-minded adults, but her research found a very small relationship between civic education and voting turnout from the 1950s to the 2000s.
That doesn’t mean civic education is a waste of time, Hillygus said. Rather, it means civics needs an overhaul to meet its full potential.
Too much of civic education is focused on historical facts and figures, memorizing dates and recalling key events, at the expense of more practical knowledge like how to register to vote, cast a ballot and participate in the current political environment, she said.
Schools also need to instill political motivation and perseverance into students who may face an uphill battle their first time navigating the voting system. Studies show that voting is a habit; once someone votes once, they tend to repeat the practice. The opposite is also true; each year someone goes without voting, the less likely they are to start participating.
UNC Charlotte political science professor and researcher Jason Giersch found similarly lackluster connections between civic education and turnout in a 2018 study.
Alongside his co-author, Giersch determined that social studies and civics course requirements didn’t consistently correlate with higher youth voter registration or turnout.
Giersch wouldn’t read too much into it, he said. The results are likely skewed by the degree of variation in civics instruction across classrooms.
“When you don’t have an exam, if all you have is a list of a curriculum, in the classroom, that could be taught any one of 1,000 different ways,” he said. “So some will be ways that lead towards people being civically active, and some will lead towards students not becoming civically active. And because it’s going in so many different directions, you end up with an insignificant result.”
Sometimes, civics is just plain boring. At least that’s what Alonso hears from her classmates in Mecklenburg County.
Since COVID, people have stopped participating in class discussions, either because they don’t find the subject matter interesting or don’t feel comfortable sharing their opinion. Sometimes, it’s obvious the teacher isn’t passionate about the subject, which leads to bland instruction, but other times, her teachers have tried to make class engaging to no avail, Alonso said.
Kids are distracted by social media, video games and friends. Their attention spans have shortened. And after COVID, they tend to hide away behind their phone or computer screens, she added.
Teachers shy away too, for the most part.
“Most of them are extremely careful with what they say, just because they do not want to offend anyone,” Alonso said. “…The majority of them, I’ll say, are pretty well reserved when it comes to that, and know how to pick out topics where they aren’t as controversial.”
North Carolina student Shrutav Deshpande said none of his teachers want to start a classroom debate; so, instruction is mostly centered on facts and history, with few projects or interactive lessons.
“Sadly, instead of benefiting America, politics has split us in two,” Deshpande said. “Every classroom has members from both sides, and any actual depth into politics could be dangerous.”
The importance of civic education
Civic education begins even before the first day of school.
The way students are raised by their parents and their communities is an early determinant of their eventual civic engagement. For example, if a student’s parents talk about voting, they’re more likely to follow in their footsteps. If there’s no community culture around participating in local politics, it may feel less important.
But formal education plays a significant role, too.
Civic education may be particularly impactful among certain groups who have fewer opportunities to develop civic skills outside of the classroom. Nearly 30% of students learn about civics only or mostly in schools, according to a 2022 report by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.
White rural youth and Black and Latino men are overrepresented in these groups. On the other hand, urban teens tended to receive higher quality civic education, including media literacy lessons, classroom discussions and service learning opportunities.
Civic education builds a student’s concept of the world and their place in society outside of family, said Bryan Proffitt, former high school social studies teacher and vice president of the North Carolina Association of Educators. It is crucial that it doesn’t take shortcuts, he said.
If students are able to pass a civics class by reciting the roles of the three branches of government, they’re probably not going to be prepared to understand what it means to vote, follow a debate or participate in a school board meeting, Proffitt said. The world isn’t “uncomplicated” or “uncontroversial,” he said; effective civic education needs to encompass all of its nuance.
“There is an incredibly consequential political decision that is up in the next election,” he said. “Do we have a set of people who are able to think for themselves, versus a set of people who are just going to believe whatever propaganda someone foists on them?”
But the impact of lagging civic education goes beyond voting and participation, Clarke said. If done properly, it teaches kids to solve problems together, to feel heard and valued and to be informed and respectful adults, she said.
“There are some values that kids need to learn and take with them wherever they go, and if civics is not being taught, then I don’t see how they will make good choices in their everyday life,” Clarke said.
Less civics, more polarization
Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer is worried. While citizens under 45 make up the largest group of registered voters, they turn out to the polls at the lowest rates of all generations, he said.
Older North Carolinians won’t be around forever, and when they’re gone, they’ll leave behind a less engaged electorate to make the decisions.

“How will those decisions be made and who will be making them?” Bitzer asked. “Are they the most extreme voices, or are there folks that are more representative of our society broadly?”
It’s political gospel: the fewer people who show up, the more extreme the outcome. The more extreme outcomes, the more polarized a society will become. The more polarized a society, the less trust people have in the government and each other.
Civic education, while seemingly not working at the moment, is uniquely positioned to alleviate the issue. After all, education is the one space that captures nearly all Americans at some point.
If nothing changes, youth will continue to be underrepresented in the electorate.
“The reason that Social Security is the third rail of politics, rather than education spending, is because old people vote and young people don’t,” Hillygus said.
Civic education doesn’t just teach people how to vote. It is also supposed to raise the next generation of leaders by teaching students how to disagree civilly — something not often represented in today’s contentious political world, youth civic organization GenerationNation executive director Amy Farrell said.
“It’s how to disagree about something and not be horrible to each other; to have conversations about things and to listen to the other side,” she said.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Credit: (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – When Billie Dolce heard a storm was coming in August 2005, she gathered up the papers she thought she would need for the upcoming school year — learning plans tailored for her special education students at Colton Middle School on St. Claude Avenue, and her classroom attendance rolls.
But she never had a chance to take roll call. Hurricane Katrina and the flooding caused by the failure of the federal levee system devastated the city, shutting down New Orleans schools and scattering students, teachers and their families. Months later, the Orleans Parish School Board fired Dolce and all 7,500 other public school employees, and Dolce never taught again at Colton. The papers she had safeguarded from the hurricane sat among her belongings for the next 20 years, until her husband finally burned them in their backyard this summer.
The firings signaled a drastic shift for public education in the city — and for the educators who made up its workforce. In the months following the storm, the state of Louisiana would take over most of New Orleans’ public school district, rebuilding and reshaping it into what would eventually become the country’s first all-charter school system.
Teachers like Dolce looked on as the schools that had long anchored the city’s neighborhoods, and the identities of the city’s people, changed names and changed hands. The charter system did away with attendance zones, sending children to schools outside of their own neighborhoods. Schools were once under a traditional accountability system overseen by publicly elected school board officials. Now, unelected, nonprofit charter boards made decisions for individual schools.
“They broke us down,” said Dolce, now 73. “Everything. Not just Katrina’s damage to homes and lives, but people’s careers, their idea of how they wanted to plan.”
Those who supported the new system cited the poor pre-Katrina performance of the more than 100 city schools that were subsequently moved under state control, along with the school district’s troubled finances, as reasons for the takeover, or “reform,” as they called it.
In the following years, the reformers pointed to sustained “gains in a wide range of student outcomes,” including better test scores and college entry rates, as signs of their success.
Still, the mass terminations had consequences, veteran educators and community leaders say: for the city’s Black middle class, for its teachers union, and for the classroom experiences of its students. Seasoned educators walked away from their careers in New Orleans, feeling disempowered by the reforms, which effectively dismantled the labor power of teachers in the city. The makeup of the city’s educators became whiter and younger, with programs like Teach for America bringing in teachers with less experience, often fresh out of college.
“It was devastating,” said Beverly Wright, an environmental justice scholar whose uncle was a retired teacher at the time of the storm. “It was destabilizing for the whole community. For New Orleans in particular, it literally lit a match to the middle class of this city. … So much of the wealth that we had came out of working in the public school system.”
Now, two decades after the storm, Verite News spoke with more than a dozen educators to understand how the firings shaped their lives.

Dolce was the department chair for special ed at Colton, where she had worked for three decades. She was the kind of teacher who recognized the needs of her students and worked to fulfill them. She decorated her classroom with abandon, incorporated washboards and clothing lines into lessons about the water cycle, and brought in pomegranates and kiwis for children who’d never tried them before.
She was following in the footsteps of generations of Black teachers in the city. The city’s schools and educators reflected how the city’s Black communities had valued and championed education since the Jim Crow era, said the Rev. Brenda Square, who directed the archives and library at the Amistad Research Center at the time of the storm and who later worked to document city’s shift to charter schools. While some New Orleans schools still bore the names of wealthy 19th century slave owners and segregationists, others were named for Black educators and community leaders who had advocated for schools and students, like Joseph Hardin and Alfred Lawless. 
“We had generations of people who were denied the opportunity to go to school to be educated. It was illegal to teach our ancestors to read and write. So education was our opportunity,” said Square, who is Black.
Teaching also served as a steady middle-class job in a city where such jobs could be hard to come by, with a salary that could help buy a house in Gentilly or New Orleans East and put money back into the local economy. By the 2004-2005 school year, teachers made an average of $38,175, according to The Times-Picayune, or about $63,000 in today’s dollars.
Barbara Shelby, a former school psychologist for the district who now works with Wright at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, said the city’s homegrown, veteran teachers were unique in the way they cared for their students.
“Each school was like a family, and they nurtured the kids for generations,” Shelby said. “It wasn’t just a job. It was a calling. I mean, they put their whole heart and soul, their blood, sweat and tears into it.”
Grace Lomba worked as a teacher at Alfred Lawless for 30 years and a guidance counselor at Frederick Douglass High School for eight. Inspired by her own high school guidance counselor, Lomba said she wanted to pass on her good experiences to the next generation.
“They just felt that they could really talk to me about anything, because they knew that whatever we talked about was private,” Lomba said. “We took our kids under our wings, and they trusted us, we trusted them.”
After the storm, Lomba retired. She missed friends and family who had left the city, she said, but most of all, she missed her students.

One of Lomba’s former students, Valda Ridgley, remembers Lomba being “the best teacher ever.” Ridgley, originally from Chicago but with ancestral roots in Louisiana, attended Alfred Lawless Junior High for the two years she lived in New Orleans, between 1978 and 1980. She was enrolled in Lomba’s 7th grade honors English class. Ridgley said Lomba even took her to Catholic church after Ridgley, a Baptist, said she wanted to go to church with her teacher.
The two have stayed in touch over the decades, supporting each other through illnesses and the deaths of loved ones. Even though it’s been 47 years since Ridgley was in the 7th grade, she said she will always think of Lomba as her English teacher.
“She didn’t talk at you, like, ‘I’m the teacher, you’re the student, you listen.’ She actually talked to us and listened to what we had to say,” Ridgley said. “As the young folks say today, she met us where we were. She didn’t talk to us like we were imbeciles. She talked to us like we had some sense.”

The shared identities between students and teachers before Katrina — being Black and from New Orleans — helped uplift kids and remind them that they were capable, Wright said. “I always knew that I could become a teacher,” Wright said, because she only had Black teachers growing up.
By 2005, over 70% of New Orleans public school teachers were Black. Their organizational power was concentrated in their politically influential union, the United Teachers of New Orleans. UTNO’s collective bargaining agreements with the district allowed teachers to negotiate higher salaries and better benefits. The school district also had a transparent pay scale and protections that allowed teachers to stay in their careers for decades, unlike the relatively short-term placements that later became common through Teach for America.
Not everyone saw that power, and those protections, as a net positive. A common line of criticism by the reformers was that the union protected bad teachers along with the good, limiting student and district progress.
Leslie Jacobs, a former member of both the Orleans Parish School board and the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, is often credited as one of the main architects of the New Orleans education-reform model. After Katrina, she was a hugely influential advocate of charter school expansion, and a critic of the local teachers union.
In an interview, Jacobs told Verite News that before Katrina, teachers were caught in a failed system. Dismantling the collective bargaining agreement, a consequence of the turn to the all-charter system, wasn’t an intentional goal of the movement, Jacobs said, and the new system never prevented teachers from unionizing within charter schools.
“It’s a true statement that I’ve never been a fan of collective bargaining, but I’m not banging on the table speaking against it,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs said well-run schools don’t give teachers cause to unionize, because their grievances can be easily remedied by principals, who have more power under charter schools than traditionally run schools. In recent years, teachers within a handful of charter schools have voted to unionize, despite strong pushback from charter leadership.
Wright, and many educators, see the restructuring, which shifted power away from elected officials, differently.
“They were really talking about Black power, the power over the school board, the power over the city,” Wright said.
Reformers also pointed to the school district’s financial woes and its management problems, along with the low academic outcomes of many of its schools, as indicators that the system needed drastic changes.
And in the years leading up to the storm, the district faced increasing scrutiny, with the FBI opening a branch within the Orleans Parish School Board offices to investigate bribery charges between contractors and school board officials, leading to dozens of indictments and convictions.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Before Katrina, the state’s Recovery School District, established by the legislature in 2003, had already taken over a handful of the city’s underperforming schools, tasking charter operations to run them.
After the storm, with the city’s schools effectively shut down, the state moved rapidly. Despite pushback from the teachers union and New Orleans lawmakers — who pointed out that parents displaced by the storm had no say in the matter — in November 2005, at the urging of Gov. Kathleen Blanco, the legislature passed a measure enabling a state takeover.
The new law broadened the definition of what was considered a failing school, expanding it to include any school with performance scores below state average — but applied that new definition only to Orleans Parish schools. Shortly after, the Recovery School District took over 102 out of 117 city schools. By the end of the same month, New Orleans school board officials said that as a result, they would have to fire and terminate health insurance for 7,500 furloughed workers.
Teachers, like other residents of the city, had scattered across the country when the storm hit. Some remembered received letters from the state informing them of their terminations. Others found out about the dissolution of the school system on the news, watching as officials dismissed thousands of New Orleans educators on television.
“They say terminated, I say fired,” said Linda Pichon, a longtime paraprofessional at Lawrence D. Crocker Elementary.

With the loss of their jobs came the loss of health care and income. Family members who relied on that income and coverage suffered, too.
Jackie Brown-Cockerham was in a Texas hospital when she found out she’d lost her job. She was there with her daughter, who was having stomach pains, but the insurance card that she had wasn’t working because she was no longer recognized as an employee. “OK, so what am I supposed to do for my child?” Brown-Cockerham remembered thinking as her daughter sat waiting for care.
Teachers who stayed saw their coworkers leave the city for good, often finding better-paying jobs in the places where they’d evacuated, west to Texas and east to Atlanta. Still, some educators chose to work for the Recovery School District, taking a test mandated by the district’s superintendent to get rehired.
Yvonne Guice, who had taught pre-K at Crocker before the storm, was one of those who returned in 2006. Now, Guice found herself with 27 preschoolers in one classroom, trying to balance lesson plans with the needs of students who had lived through the storm. When it rained, the children gathered around Guice and cried. They wouldn’t let her turn off the lights during naptime.
“You don’t know what they went through, you don’t know what happened, and so you just took it as it came,” Guice said.
By the fall of 2007, about half of the fired New Orleans teachers had returned to work in Louisiana public schools — in Orleans Parish and elsewhere, according to the Education Research Alliance. By 2013, just 22% of the fired teachers were still teaching in New Orleans, with an attrition rate higher than other districts affected by the hurricane.
Educators said that the leaders of charter school reform had villainized teachers, often laying the blame on them for a lack of resources and the district’s shortcomings.
“The least popular cause in town right now must be the resistance of some teachers and their union to the chartering of public schools,” declared James Gill in a November 2005 column for the Times-Picayune.
“Indeed, there is so little sympathy for teachers who feel hard done-by that they might be well advised to pipe down,” Gill wrote. “After all, some of them must share responsibility for the shortcomings of a system that has long cried out for the kind of radical overhaul now in the offing.” (Gill died in 2024.)
“Every ill that the system was going through was the teachers’ fault,” said Cynthia Jordan, who taught at William O. Rodgers and John A. Shaw elementaries before the storm and later worked for the RSD.
Charter advocates argued that the job security and protections offered to teachers by the union and district didn’t help students. “At a charter, we all have to perform to keep our jobs,” said Sharon Clark, the director and principal of Sophie B. Wright High School in a 2012 report. “If teachers at Wright do not perform, I can free up their future to do something else.”


Let us know what you think...


 

A couple weeks after Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, the New Orleans school board held a meeting in Baton Rouge, where several board members attempted to replace then-superintendent Ora Watson with Bill Roberti, one of the consultants with the New York firm Alvarez and Marsal, which had been brought on to rectify the district’s financial woes before the storm.
The vote was split down racial lines, with the board’s three Black members defeating the effort that day. One of those members, the Rev. Torin Sanders, told the Times-Picayne that the effort, which would’ve demoted Watson, who is Black, in favor of Roberti, who is white, was “clearly” racially motivated. Both he and Watson have suggested state education superintendent Cecil Picard was behind the move. (Picard died in 2007.)
“The state superintendent couldn’t stand me,” Watson said in an interview. “He wanted me out of there because he wanted his plan in.”
The meeting alarmed some of the board’s observers — including a group of principals and their attorney, Willie Zanders, who huddled afterward to talk about what had just happened. That day, the school board also voted to place all district employees on disaster leave. Zanders and the principals began to sense a shift in power.
“So we’re meeting at the coffee shop, and we’re discussing this, and the leaders of the principal group said, ‘We need to consider going to court to stop this,’” Zanders recalled.
Zanders’ and the principals’ challenge evolved into a yearslong court fight on behalf of all 7,500 fired employees — including more than 4,000 teachers, along with paraprofessionals, counselors, bus drivers, and others — over whether their firings had been legal.
In 2012, a district court ruled in favor of the teachers, finding that the school board had wrongly terminated them. An appeals court again sided with the educators, with damages estimated at $1.5 billion, a figure that could have bankrupted the district. The school board appealed the case up to the state’s highest court, which ruled against the teachers, and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear the case in 2015.
“I think this whole charter school transition has avoided putting the microscope on human lives that have been impacted and affected by this drive for change,” Zanders said in an interview, reflecting on the case.
Before the storm, it wasn’t uncommon for teachers to have personal connections with their students. Living in the same neighborhoods, they might have known a student’s aunt or parent before the child came into their classroom — or even to have taught that parent.
“There was a standard you expected of your teacher, and there was a standard your teacher expected of you,” Jordan said. “I lived in the community with my students.”

Educators said that the loss of district schools disrupted the communal and economic fabric of Black neighborhoods, and took power away from citizens living in them.
Now, decisions about how schools are run are determined by charter operators, each run by a private board unimpeded by the democratic process. For formerly unionized teachers, that amounts to less accountability over administrators.
“We have no control over charter schools,” Wright said. “The people on the board, half of us don’t know who they are, but that system has been removed from us, and our children are suffering because of the lack of participation of Black people in the system.”
Last year, OPSB discussed running more direct-run schools when it took over the failing Lafayette Academy, a charter school, to open the public district-run Leah Chase School — the first new traditional school it had opened since the storm. But more recently, the current New Orleans public schools superintendent expressed caution against opening more schools, given the district’s decreasing enrollment numbers and financial difficulties.
Most of the educators Verite News spoke with expressed deep distrust towards charter schools and their leadership hierarchies, even if they returned to work in the new system.
Pichon, a longtime paraprofessional, was first recruited into the job by a principal when she was vice-president of the parent-teachers organization for her children’s school, Thomas Alva Edison Elementary. She spent the next three decades working mostly at Crocker. Pichon was wary of the newcomers, people who hadn’t spent their lives teaching. In the turmoil following the storm, she chose not to return to the classroom.
“Drop of a hat, they’ll let you go,” Pichon said.
The splintered system also made it hard for the United Teachers of New Orleans to reorganize following the storm. Instead of negotiating contracts with one authority, OPSB, they now have to unionize and negotiate under dozens of different charter operators. UTNO’s presence, which once defined the district, is now limited to five unionized schools.
Some educators decided to stay with UTNO, even without a contract, to retain certain union benefits. After the storm, the American Federation of Teachers — the national organization under which UTNO organized — tried to rebuild the union and recruit teachers. Lomba worked with the union to try to get veteran teachers to rejoin the union, but organizing was “a big task, because most of our people were not here,” she said.

Other educators said that without the power of a union backing them during disputes, they were hesitant to go back into the classroom.
Dolce had always tried to advocate for her students and her colleagues, even when it meant pushing back against administrative decisions. After the storm, she heard from other teachers who had returned to the classroom and found that they could now be fired for speaking up.
“I knew I had not gone back for a reason, because I don’t want ‘fired’ to be on my legacy,” Dolce said.
Dolce retired after Katrina, unwilling to go through the hurdles of getting hired by the Recovery School District, though she had planned to keep teaching for several more years. Still, she stayed busy — she tutored, phone-banked for the union and wrote individualized education plans for a friend who was trying to reopen Priestley Junior High, doling out her expertise when asked. She took part in the class-action lawsuit, attending court proceedings.
But she found it hard to let go of Colton. After officials finished renovating the school in 2013, Dolce wanted to see how it had changed, so she contacted administrators with the charter network KIPP, which now runs a school — KIPP Leadership — at the old Colton building. They agreed to let her walk around. As she made her way down the familiar halls, trailed by an employee, Dolce took notice of the upgrades, like touchscreen whiteboards and nicer desks. Finally, Dolce reached her old classroom, where the walls were freshly painted and the teacher’s desk was in a different spot.
She felt a sudden impulse to put her initials somewhere, as if she were one of her own students. Maybe under the ledge of the board, where no one would notice. “But I didn’t do it,” Dolce said. Instead, she turned around and walked away.

White, in response, said Duff while on the college board helped implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs anathema to conservative Republican policy.","Higher education — central to the public profiles of billionaire businessman Tommy Duff and State Auditor Shad White, two Republicans eyeing Mississippi’s governorship in 2027 — has already become a point of division between them.
Duff, in a recent interview, appeared to take a shot at White, saying politicians should focus on the jobs they currently hold, not future ambitions for higher office. White, in response, said Duff, while on the college board, helped implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs anathema to conservative Republican policy.
In Mississippi, issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion and other culture war battles roiling higher education have become a wedge issue in intraparty political spats, a legal fight unfolding in federal court and an ongoing effort to keep college students from leaving the state in droves.
Duff is considering a run for governor and has made higher education a top focus of his recent public appearances. He cites his budget stewardship during his stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board from May 2015 to May 2024. 
White, both through reports issued by his office and his own bully pulpit, has led a high-profile campaign for conservative reform of Mississippi’s higher education system.
Duff has hinted at the broad outlines of what could become a gubernatorial campaign agenda, but he has largely done so without offering specific policy proposals, citing the nearly 27 months remaining until Election Day in 2027. The gubernatorial race, Duff added in an interview with Mississippi Today, should not distract current state leaders interested in running from attending to the demands of their offices.
 “I kind of wish all these people that want to be running that maybe have government jobs and responsibilities ought to tend to the ones they have,” Duff said. He didn’t name White, but the comment appeared to be a shot at him. 
In response to Duff’s statement, White criticized Duff’s track record on the IHL Board.   
“When Tommy Duff was on the board running our universities, he supported the creation of the DEI office at Ole Miss, on his watch the University Medical Center started an ‘LGBTQ Clinic’ which gave puberty blockers to transgender minors, and he voted to require the COVID shot for university employees before they were allowed to come back to work, so I sort of wish he would have done a better job when he was in his government position,” White said. “I’d have less to clean up.”
In a statement, Jordan Russell, a spokesperson for Duff, called White’s statement “blatantly false” but declined to comment further. 
John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL, said the University of Mississippi’s Division of Diversity and Community Engagement was requested by the university and approved by the Board in April 2017
The University of Mississippi Medical Center’s now dissolved “LGBTQ clinic” was created in 2019, and an IHL Board vote was not required for its creation, Sewell said. 
On the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Sewell said the board voted against a systemwide mandate in August of 2021, but was then prompted to change course in response to federal regulations. 
“The next month, President Biden issued an order demanding that federal contractors and subcontractors be vaccinated. To avoid losing federal research dollars, the Board voted in October 2021 that individuals considered federal contractors and subcontractors should comply with the executive order,” Sewell said.  
Neither Duff nor White has formally entered the race for governor, but they have both said they are considering a run. Their experience, along with Mississippi’s specific economic challenges, suggests higher education could play a major role in shaping state politics for years to come.  
Duff focuses on fiscal policies
In what Duff’s advisers characterized as the first political speech of his life earlier this month, he reminded the crowd of his tenure on the IHL Board. 
Duff anchored his comments about his experience on the IHL Board in cost savings – a message that aligns with the Trump administration’s elevation of “government efficiency” as a leading political priority. 
Duff said that he oversaw the hiring of a firm to coordinate health insurance policies across the nine institutions in the IHL system, and that resulted in millions in savings. He also said he helped revamp the interest payments universities were paying on bond projects, resulting in about $100 million in savings.
He appeared at a Mississippi Today event with business leaders about “brain drain” and highlighted the need to keep more Mississippi-educated college students in the state by attracting more private-sector jobs. And in an earlier interview with Mississippi Today, he noted that he and his brother are also major supporters of higher education, having donated about $50 million to Mississippi universities. 
Duff also said he supports adding “civic responsibilities” to curricula at Mississippi universities. That reflects ideological currents sweeping the country, with several Republican-led states enacting laws requiring students to take civics-focused courses — often with an emphasis on Western civilization — while scaling back identity-focused content such as race or gender studies.
“I don’t think that’s taught as much anymore. What it means to be an American, a Mississippian. What does it mean to be a future member of society, a citizen? The importance of voting,” Duff said. “Those type of things need to be added into college curricula. Learning our constitution, that type of stuff that makes you more well-rounded and makes you a better student and adult.” 
White has called for Mississippi to change how it funds higher education by stripping public money from degree programs that don’t align with the state’s labor force needs. White pitched that policy as his own solution to brain drain. The idea is that outmigration could be blunted by increasing funding for degree programs with higher earning potential right after graduating, such as in engineering or business management, according to a 2023 report issued by White’s office. 
White was the earliest and most vocal state leader to come out in favor of banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in schools. 
In a statement, Jacob Walters, a spokesperson for White, said the auditor wants to ensure DEI departments are not recreated again under a different name. White also wants to use the money that previously went to DEI offices to increase campus security. 
Walters also provided other higher education proposals White supports, many of which align with the Trump administration’s push to shape teaching around cultural issues and eliminate  “useless woke programs.”  
“Taxpayer money should not be used to fund Gender Studies programs that feature ‘queer studies’ coursework,” Walters wrote. “This can be found right now at our universities. Instead, taxpayer money should fund degree programs that prepare students for real jobs and don’t saddle them with debt they cannot repay.” 
White wants to require that all universities teach “the scientific reality that there are only two sexes,” Walters wrote. 
He also supports putting a surcharge on out-of-state students who attend Mississippi universities. The revenue would be used to fund a scholarship for any graduate with good grades in a high-need field who agrees to work in Mississippi for the first four years after graduation.
Duff and White are seen as likely candidates for governor in 2027, but Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson is the only notable candidate who has officially announced he’s running. 
Gipson also supports eliminating the ability of Mississippi universities to set goals around “diversity outcomes,” a push that became easier after Trump’s reelection, he told Mississippi Today.  
“Like most Mississippians, I’ve always supported hiring and recruitment based on individual merit and qualifications, so I was glad to see IHL move this direction beginning in November 2024,” Gipson said.
Going forward, Gipson said Mississippi universities must adapt to a declining student population, which some call an “enrollment cliff.” Mississippi can do that by highlighting its “quality of life and college experience and culture that other parts of the country can’t offer,” he added.
Preparing students with skills in data and artificial intelligence – industries already disrupting the American economy – would also be at the top of the two-term agriculture commissioner’s higher education agenda as governor, he said.  
There are just under 80,000 students enrolled at Mississippi’s eight public universities and the University of Mississippi Medical Center, many of whom returned to classes this month. They did so as a legal battle heats up that could fundamentally reshape the composition of student bodies and the dictate which subjects they are taught.
Legal questions loom over DEI
After President Trump made banning DEI programs de rigueur for Republican state legislatures, Mississippi lawmakers introduced legislation for two consecutive legislative sessions. They questioned university officials on their implementation of diversity initiatives and finally succeeded in passing a statewide ban in 2025. 
Last week, a federal judge blocked a Mississippi law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Mississippi public schools from going into effect. 
As Mississippi geared up to shutter DEI from its schools, the Trump administration unleashed a torrent of executive actions aimed at universities. The federal government launched civil rights investigations into elite universities and froze billions in federal research money
The Mississippi ruling prevents officials from enforcing the law. Attorneys for the plaintiffs and the state defendants will now move to discovery, where they collect evidence before a bench trial. 
The litigation could drag on past the 2026 legislative session, forcing Republican lawmakers to keep pushing to enact a policy they had already spent over a year drafting and debating.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29112520/White-Duff-Gipson-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-08-31 06:56:21.789003
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-31 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How easy COVID money whet CT lawmakers’ appetites for more,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/31/ct-earmarks-grants-doug-mccrory/,"Many CT legislators are now able to send millions in grants to constituent groups without oversight, standards or transparency.","A few nonprofits serving constituents of Sen. Doug McCrory of Hartford did extraordinarily well when COVID relief arrived through the federal American Rescue Plan Act. 
Funding for one, the Blue Hills Civic Association, tripled to $1.32 million one year, then quadrupled to $5.62 million the next.
The ARPA money was easy, flowed fast and came with a hard end date. It benefited the constituents of far more lawmakers than McCrory. And it whet the appetite for more.
The FBI is now investigating McCrory’s role in obtaining grants for nonprofits, and it comes during a time when Connecticut lawmakers are enjoying a golden age of grants that come with minimal vetting or transparency.
As the ARPA gusher began to go dry — the last of the money was obligated last year and must be spent by Dec. 31, 2026 — the state legislature’s Democratic majority tapped a new well: Appropriating nearly $60 million over two biennial budget cycles for unrestricted grants to be distributed at their discretion.
Earmarks, an endangered species after the arrival of the Great Recession of 2008 and start of decade-plus fiscal crisis in Connecticut, are flourishing.
The two-year budget adopted in 2023 directed the state Department of Economic and Community Development to disburse $17.9 million over two years from a line item labeled “various grants” — an unheralded new source of earmarks. The new biennial budget adopted in June more than doubled it to nearly $39 million.
“Legislators were very used to, with the ARPA dollars, having the capacity to help out different organizations within their communities,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. “And that’s how this has sort of blown up.”
The unrestricted DECD line item is sending money this year and next to more than 120 recipients, none of whom had to submit applications. The only requirement is to know a lawmaker on good terms with the House and Senate Democratic leaders or their top aides.
“It’s asinine,” said Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, the ranking House Republican on Appropriations. “There’s no vetting.”
Other funding — sometimes blandly labeled as “other expenses,” other times in  accounts with names suggesting a purpose — also is directed by lawmakers to chosen recipients in grants distributed by other agencies. 
Some are noted in budget working documents obtained by The Connecticut Mirror as priorities of “SD” or “HD,” short for Senate Democrats and House Democrats. There is $2.9 million in the state Department of Education budget labeled “Senate earmarks” and $1.7 million for “HD priority earmarks.”
“We are now patronizing public officials’ wants and desires, as opposed to vetting these projects and letting them stand on their own two feet,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
The impulse to earmark, to bring home the bacon, is as old as politics. When Connecticut had divided government — Republican governors held office for 16 years until January 2011, most often with Democratic legislatures — such spending greased the wheels of government.
The earmarks
How does one get an earmark today? That turned out to be an awkward question.
“It is really a process where individual legislators make an ask. I mean, I don’t know how else to put it,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said, “I think there are a lot of different entry points.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was slightly more effusive, acknowledging the answer can depend on who is doing the asking, where the money is going and what are the financial and political needs of a district and its representative.
“What do I look for? Is there an interesting story to be told, something where you sort of are sympathetic to the cause?” Ritter said. “Is it just simply a member that is in a tough district? Is it a member you really like? I mean, there’s different reasons you might give a grant like that out.”
It wasn’t like you could take the ARPA money and just sit on it.House Speaker Matt Ritter
Candelora’s concerns echo those periodically voiced by the Auditors of Public Accounts, a legislative agency overseen by a Democrat and a Republican. In 2001, the focus was grants that flowed through the Office of Policy and Management, not the Department of Economic and Community Development. 
The concerns were that the grants were inequitable, issued at the direction of politicians without vetting or competition, and too rarely were subjected to analysis of their efficacy. 
“We were informed that the Other Expenses grants are issued by OPM without solicitation, but merely upon communication from political leaders,” the auditors wrote at the time. “Final reports and/or State Single Audits regarding the grantees’ use of funds were not always available or pursued. There was no evidence available to suggest that an evaluation of the relative merit of the projects was performed.”
ARPA funds are subject to audits.
Ritter said most of the earmark recipients are long-established organizations with clear missions. Some are municipal agencies. But he acknowledged the FBI investigation has heightened sensitivity about process and accountability.
“As someone who represents Hartford, and reading what I’m reading, I’m the first one to say the mechanisms could be better,” Ritter said. “There needs to be more checks and balances in place. No question about that.”
So far, the FBI investigation appears to be narrow, focused on McCrory and his relationship with a woman who runs a nonprofit and consults for others, and with several nonprofits that have obtained state funding with his support. 
Earlier this month, federal prosecutors issued a subpoena seeking emails, financial records and other information from the DECD regarding McCrory and a dozen non-profits and other entities, including three well-established with a presence in his district: Blue Hills Civic Association, Upper Albany Neighborhood Collaborative and the YMCA of Greater Hartford.
One potential witness, an executive with deep familiarity with Hartford’s nonprofit ecosystem, told CT Mirror that they and others first were interviewed by the FBI in 2023, after the ARPA money began flowing. The person declined to be identified. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to say when the investigation began.
Connecticut state government’s share of ARPA funding was $2.8 billion, spread over five fiscal years. About $119 million went to nonprofits.
“What happened during ARPA was A) we had so much money, but B) it had to be spent. That’s what people forget,” Ritter said. “It wasn’t like you could take the ARPA money and just sit on it. And there was real concern at some point, like, can we actually spend all of this, get it out the door?”

No accounting
There is no precise account of what funding McCrory or any other legislator has helped deliver to grantees, either with state or federal funds. Unlike in Congress, where members publicly list their recommendations for earmarks, the General Assembly maintains no record of individual legislators’ requests for directed spending in their districts.
The U.S. Congress banned earmarks in 2011 then reinstated them with greater accountability in 2022 as “congressionally directed spending” in the Senate and “community project spending” in the House.
“Under the new system,” according to the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan congressional watchdog, “Members must provide information, such as the purpose and recipient of the funding to ensure no conflicts of interest. Another requirement is that GAO get involved in tracking the funds.”
None of that is required by the Connecticut General Assembly.
In the recently adopted budget, the intended recipients of funds from the DECD’s various-grants line are not identified. 
There are no parameters on what that line item is for.Matt Pugliese, deputy commissioner, DECD
But a budget worksheet obtained by CT Mirror lists more than 120 recipients in the two fiscal years, with annual awards ranging from $2,500 for the Iwo Jima Memorial Historical Foundation in New Britain to three grants of $1 million: for parks in Manchester, the Upper Albany neighborhood of Hartford, and to a “Consortium of 3 Faith Based Organizations” for counseling, mentoring and youth violence prevention.
No other details are available.
The unrestricted various-grants line items in the DECD budget are unlike others administered by the agency, which generally has an open application process and statutory or agency standards for when the money can be paid and how it can be used.
With no applications from which to work, the DECD sometimes has to track down the recipients intended by lawmakers for the unrestricted grants. 
“We have to literally track down and figure out what the organization is,” said Matt Pugliese, a deputy commissioner at DECD. “Sometimes you have two organizations with very similar names. We do a little bit of detective work, confirm with the legislature that this is the entity that was intended in the budget.”
The DECD will execute a contract with few requirements. Recipients have until the end of the fiscal year to expend the funds.
“The organizations are supposed to provide a report to us at the end of the fiscal year as to how the funds were spent,” Pugliese said. “But, just to be clear, there are no parameters on what that line item is for. It can be used for operational expenses, could be used for a new program. It could be used for a capital project.”
The contrast with the Community Investment Fund, one of the competitive grants programs administered by DECD, is stark. It was created in 2021 as a compromise struck to overcome Gov. Ned Lamont’s tightfisted approach to borrowing for earmarks sought by lawmakers.
Lamont agreed to $175 million in annual bonding for five years for local capital projects awarded through the Community Investment Fund, which imposed transparency, standards and accountability on a process that was formerly ad hoc, often reflecting the influence of a single lawmaker.
Vetting is by DECD staff, which looks for broader community support and local financial contribution. Approval comes in a public vote by an oversight board co-chaired by Ritter and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. The grants have gone to governments and nonprofits in 35 of the 55 communities that meet eligibility standards assessing economic need and poverty.
State procurement rules, such as obtaining multiple appraisals to purchase land, are enforced.
Youth Services Prevention Grants
A decade ago, the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus negotiated an unusual deal that has held to this day: the creation of Youth Services Prevention grants, their recipients chosen by caucus members. 
Each of its 37 members can direct $150,000 annually in grants, up from $100,000 in recent years. This year, for the first time, four South Asian lawmakers were allotted the same. The grants are administered by the Judicial Department. 
Members of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus say their handling of Youth Services Prevention Grants might provide a model for improving the performance of other grant recipients. 
Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, a caucus member and long-time co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said the grants were negotiated after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.
Urban lawmakers and community advocates said the killing of 20 students and six educators was understandably galvanizing, and it led to passage of some of the nation’s strongest gun safety laws. But they said the reaction underscored to them the tolerance of a steady and largely unnoticed of violence claiming the lives of urban young.
The Youth Service Prevention grants and a related Youth Violence Initiative were the responses from legislative leaders.
Part of the earmarks controlled by the caucus are paying the Tow Youth Justice Institute and the University of New Haven to develop and run a performance-based accountability tool to train and assess Youth Service Prevention grantees.
“When you try and demonstrate the inequities of things that are going on in different neighborhoods, you’ve got to have the data to prove it, and then you’ve also got to prove there are better ways of doing it,” Walker said.
The Judicial Department requires grantees to report an annual summary of activities and individuals served but does not do a performance evaluation.
Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, the chair of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, said the project with Tow takes the next step.
“It’s really laid out in a way that holds folks accountable, make sure they’re doing the work they say they’re doing, and doesn’t make this just a pot of money that goes poof — but something we can really point as making an impact,” Felipe said. “I think that our model is something that folks should feel free to try to emulate.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024_0813_SR_Primaries_029-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-31 05:56:43.116561

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)In 2005, as a reporter embedded with a Missouri National Guard unit in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I witnessed one of the largest disaster relief operations in American history.
On the ground with the men and women of a Missouri Guard military police company, I was far removed from the decisions — and the blunders — that would ultimately mar the massive rescue effort. Instead, I saw firsthand how average Americans coped with the hardships and uncertainty of being thrown into a situation without precedent.
It was dirty and messy, and the outcome was uncertain. I ate MREs with the Guardsmen and chatted about their families and listened to concerns about their Constitutional duties as soldiers.
Now, the National Guard is on the streets of the District of Columbia, with live ammunition, summoned by President Donald Trump to assist in a hastily declared and thinly supported law enforcement mission. Trump is also considering other Democratic stronghold cities for such deployments, including Chicago and New York.
The contrast between the deployments could not be sharper.
Twenty years ago, the National Guard was called up in the thousands for a devastating national disaster. Today, the Guard is in DC on a partisan mission that breaks political norms. If Trump federalizes the Guard and sends it to other cities, it would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a foundational 1878 law meant to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement on American soil.
The storm that struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, was devastating. In addition to winds in excess of 100 mph that turned roofs into sails and toppled walls, Katrina also brought a surge of water that overwhelmed levees and flood walls and submerged 80% of the city. A citywide evacuation had been ordered, but some residents stayed, including many from the poorer sections of the city who didn’t have anywhere else to go. Thirty thousand people spent days in the shelter of last resort, the Louisiana Superdome, without lights or air conditioning, food or water, or functioning restrooms. Misery was widespread across the city, especially in the Lower Ninth Ward, a historically Black section of the city that experienced catastrophic flooding.
The hurricane left 1,800 people dead in New Orleans and across the Gulf coast and displaced more than a million. Katrina was also the costliest storm on record, with damage estimated at $161 billion.
But the Missouri National Guard unit I was embedded with didn’t know any of this on its convoy to New Orleans. When the soldiers of the 1138th Military Police piled into their Humvees and trucks at company headquarters at West Plains, Missouri, they had about as much information (or rather, misinformation) about the situation on the Gulf as did anyone who had been paying attention to the news. They expected out-of-control looting and general lawlessness. But the reports of looting were exaggerated and the most lawless element was among the New Orleans police, who shot 10 civilians, including four fatally.
Because I was with the Missouri National Guard unit every hour of every day on the convoy south, I knew what they were talking about. There were earnest discussions among the soldiers about what they would do if ordered to fire on American citizens for looting, and the consensus was that they would refuse. What looked like looting to one individual might just be survival. Somebody might be carrying a television to trade for food and water. Above all, they wanted to help people in need, by effecting rescues or bringing much-needed supplies.
Later, as I walked the French Quarter, I noted maroon-bereted 82nd Airborne soldiers on patrol with automatic rifles at hand. This was a disturbing sight in an American city, one that brought to mind third-world countries. But this was no banana republic. This was New Orleans in distress, and some regular Army troops, in addition to National Guard units from all 50 states, had been sent to help.
The National Guard has been deployed on American soil periodically for disaster relief or to assist local authorities with civil unrest. The latter includes the George Floyd protests in 2020, the LA riots of 1992, and at Kent State.
On May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Vietnam war protestors on the Kent State University campus, killing four students. A photograph of one of the dead students, with a girl kneeling and crying out for help behind, shook the soul of America — and won the Pulitzer Prize.
The Ohio Guard had been sent to the campus by Gov. Jim Rhodes, at the request of the Kent mayor, after the ROTC building had been burned to the ground the previous night. The Guard, with bayonets fixed, was attempting to disperse a crowd of 2,000 demonstrators. The students threw rocks, and the soldiers responded with tear gas. Then, in the space of 13 seconds, the Guardsmen fired more than 60 shots at demonstrators.
It is unclear why the soldiers took kneeling positions and opened fire, although one of the survivors said there is audio tape evidence of the command being given. Eight Ohio Guardsmen were acquitted in 1974 after a judge declared, after a two-week trial, that the government had presented insufficient evidence to support the federal indictments.
The National Guard is generally exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act, as it is normally under the control of state governors, but it becomes subject when it is called up under federal service. The District of Columbia is a special case, because the district is under control of Congress and the president is, in effect, the governor of the district.
If Trump were to deploy the Guard elsewhere, there would be a host of legal challenges. But he has already demonstrated his willingness to expand the use of the military on U.S. soil, as his administration has authorized the Guard to be deployed to assist with “alien processing” in 20 states with Republican governors. The states with Democratic governors, including Kansas, would no doubt object.
The militarization of immigration and law enforcement is disturbing. Trump is using it to punish jurisdictions that are Democratic strongholds, many of which have significant Black populations, and others that are hotbeds of dissent. His official justifications don’t pass the litmus test of truth. He claimed to deploy the Guard in D.C. to fight crime, despite violent crime there hitting a 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.
Some leaders in Kansas City, Missouri, are worried their city may be next.
“I do think Kansas City should be prepared, because this will probably happen to us,” said Kansas City Democrat Barbara Washington, as reported by the Kansas City Star. “I think the actions of our president have shown that he is not open to equality for people of color.”
While other politicians doubt Trump will take interest in any city in a state as deeply red as Missouri, some worry the high crime rates of Kansas City and St. Louis may be enough of an excuse. Kansas, where 101 out of 105 counties went for Trump in 2024, may be relatively safe. Well, except for the city of Lawrence, which might just be blue enough to attract the president’s dictatorial gaze; it went for Kamala Harris by a margin of more than 2-1.
In D.C., the 2,200 Guard members have spent the past week mulching cherry trees and clearing homeless camps. That would be in keeping with Trump’s obsession with the value of real estate and his disregard for human life. But the true goal of the deployment appears to be a further test of just how much the American public will take before standing up to authoritarianism. Congress and the Supreme Court have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to Trump, so ultimately any change must come from the ballot box.
In the seven months Trump has been in power, he has upended convention and pursued an unchecked appetite for power. The American landscape has been transformed into a terrain fit for a dictator, with ever-expanding executive power, a masked secret cadre of ICE agents pursuing migrants and sometimes citizens, a crackdown on diversity and dissent, and the growing presence of an armed military in our cities.
How long will it be before there’s another 13 seconds in which the National Guard faces off against unarmed protestors and in the chaos leaves one or more “dead on the ground?” This is something Trump may be actually hoping for, because any act of violence serves as an excuse to call out more troops. And more troops means more intimidation, more control, more power.
Trump is building a case for martial law through a series of immigration and law enforcement “emergencies,” but only for those blue cities he’d like to punish or neutralize. Chicago, New York, Baltimore. It would only be a small step from there to declaring an election emergency. He wouldn’t have to cancel or postpone the 2026 midterms. Just the presence of armed troops at polling places to ensure a “fair” election might discourage enough voters to do the trick. He’s already vowed to end mail-in voting, an anti-democracy pledge that would have sunk any other president quicker than you can say Watergate.
I don’t know what the National Guard troops deployed in D.C. are thinking, or what those who might be tasked with “alien processing” feel about it. All I have is my experience with that Missouri National Guard military police company a generation ago. But based on that, I suspect directing the Guard to deprive American citizens of their civil liberties might be more difficult than Trump thinks. Many will remember their oath is to the Constitution, not to any president or ideology.
Recently, the Trump administration placed on leave some 30 Federal Emergency Management Agency employees who signed an open letter warning of a Katrina-level disaster because of agency mismanagement. The Trump-appointed leadership, the letter said, was simply too inexperienced and too partisan to do their jobs.
The letter cited the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which exposed the federal government’s failures to prepare for disasters and deliver aid quickly.
There will never be another Hurricane Katrina.
But that’s only because the World Meteorological Organization retired the name after 2005. There will be other storms, equal to or worse than Katrina, and Trump administration ignores the signatories of the warning letter at our peril.
We find ourself in an age of storms.
To survive the current political hurricane, we must find the courage to stand up to political bullying, be guided by reason but moved by compassion, and be willing to help those among us who are in the most danger of being washed away.
The situation is without precedent.
Never before, not even during Watergate, has a U.S. president engaged in such an authoritarian power grab. If we were faced with one or two crises at a time, then it would be easier to know how to respond. But the entire federal government has been turned inside out and made the political instrument of one man. From the dismantling of the intelligence community to the purging of scientific integrity at public health and disaster response agencies, from the war on migrants to the squelching of dissent on college campuses, and now to the use of the military in law enforcement, the house Abraham Lincoln referred to in his 1858 speech is not just divided, but on fire.
“I want to speak plainly about the moment that we are in, and the actual crisis, not the manufactured one, that we are facing in this city, and as a state, and as a country,” Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said Aug. 25 in Chicago. “If it sounds to you like I am alarmed, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed.”
The odds that either of the Kansas Cities or Lawrence or any other blue dot in a red state will be targeted right now is low, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t respond to Pritzker’s tocsin. It will be dirty and messy, the outcome will be uncertain, and there will be a lot of talk about civil disobedience and our Constitutional obligations as citizens. We are beyond the guardrails of a two-party system and are now facing a party of one with ever-expanding executive power. It’s time for us to talk, at our kitchen tables and taverns and community centers, and decide what orders we’ll follow — and what kind of nation we want.

Five years ago now, Diana Jackson was walking 2,192 miles. 
The Darien native is one of over 3,300 people each year who try to walk the entire length of the Appalachian Trail (the AT), from Georgia to Maine. But she’s one of the 25% of them that actually completed the task.
She learned to hike with her parents in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and at age seven announced her goal of making the entire trek. Her parents humored her, but on graduation from Wellesley College she got serious and spent six months in preparation. “I thought of this as my gap year,” she said.


“I have a tendency of psyching myself out,” she says, so she didn’t read too many books about the dangers of the adventure. But she did drop a lot of money on a tent, sleeping bag and the first of four pairs of hiking boots… each replaced as they wore out en route.
Starting in late March south of Springer Mountain in Georgia, on her first night it rained and she got soaked. Crude shelters are maintained by volunteers along the trail, but they are first come, first served and the early spring nights were as cold in Georgia as the October nights when she finished in Maine.
When Diana was lucky, she’d find a hostel just off the trail where for $25 a night she could get a bunk. But most nights dehydrated dinners heated over her camp stove were her cuisine of choice. Over the seven months of her trek she lost 40 pounds.
Though her backpack weighed 45 pounds, she was able to average about 20 miles of walking each day.

In most places the AT is described as “the green tunnel” but in others there are serious mountains to climb and rivers to cross (some without bridges). She relied on an app called FarOut, using GPS to keep on the trail and lead her to drinkable water, shelters and hostels. At least once a day she could find a cell signal to let her family know where she was and how she was doing.
Twice she suffered injuries, falling face first and hurting her knee. She was all alone and without her usual first aid kit so she just kept going, “pushing through the pain” until she could find help.
After seven months she could see her goal in sight, 5,269 foot-tall Mount Katahdin in northern Maine, the official end of the AT.  But it took her a couple of days to reach the summit, alternately crying, laughing and filled with joy. Her parents joined her for the final climb, though she put them on a slightly easier trail.
After the victory came the inevitable letdown but also some important life lessons. “I had always doubted myself,” she says, “but now I know I can do anything.”
These days Diana works at L.L. Bean in Maine. 
“One of the things I love about the company is that their motto is ‘inspiring others to experience the restorative power of the outdoors’ and I found the AT to be healing and restorative in that way,” she says. “The trail will always be my happiest place and my most special life experience.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Diana-Jackson-Mt-Khatadin-by-Diana-Jackson.jpeg,,,2025-08-31 04:56:27.434639

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The Trump administration has agreed to release $184 million for AmeriCorps, the federal agency for service and volunteerism, after a coalition of 22 attorneys general and two governors sued in April.
The coalition, which included Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, challenged the administration’s plans to eliminate 90% of AmeriCorps’ workforce, cancel contracts and close $400 million worth of programs the agency supports, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha’s office said in a statement.
“At the last minute, when required to provide legal justification as to why it withheld funds, the administration instead did what it should have done from the beginning and released the funding,” said Frey.
“AmeriCorps represents some of the best of American values: service, community, and opportunity,” said Frey, “and Maine would have been deprived of this important, congressionally-funded AmeriCorps programming had I not joined suit to enforce the law.”
AmeriCorps, a federal agency signed into law in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, places roughly 200,000 members across the United States at 35,000 service locations, according to current agency data. There are more than 200 AmeriCorps volunteers in Maine.
It supports national and state community service programs by funding and placing volunteers in local national organizations that address critical community needs. It also provides support for organizations to recruit and supervise volunteers.
Maine organizations join coalition of nonprofits suing for AmeriCorps funding

Members serve in schools, local governments and with a wide range of nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.
The frozen funding has created uncertainty for AmeriCorps programs across the country.
In June, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated hundreds of AmeriCorps programs that were unlawfully canceled and barred the agency from making further cuts without going through a formal rulemaking process.
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), however, continued to withhold more than $184 million for service programs for seniors and those awarded highly competitive federal grants. The coalition filed an amended lawsuit in July and requested another preliminary injunction to release the remaining funds, Neronha’s office said.
The Trump administration’s deadline to respond was Thursday.
“Rather than oppose the states’ motion, the administration instead informed the court that OMB would release all withheld AmeriCorps funds … which AmeriCorps will distribute to programs nationwide, as quickly as possible,” Neronha’s office said in a statement.
In addition to the attorney general lawsuit, a nationwide coalition of nonprofits, including three from Maine, also sued the administration over the rescinded funding.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A Republican House member on Saturday resigned days after pleading guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence charges as calls mounted for him to step down.
Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, in a letter to Gov. Kevin Stitt resigned his position effective Oct. 1.
“It is in the best interest of the people I serve in House District 35 and, most importantly, my family to step down from my position,” Burns, 46, wrote. “I take full responsibility for my actions and am going to counseling with my family. Although not an excuse for my actions, I am receiving intensive treatment for issues from military service that I have long ignored as a problem.” 
The action comes after Stitt and others on Friday called for his resignation.
“It is not appropriate for a member of the legislature to continue to serve after being convicted of abuse charges while in office,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City.
Burns on Thursday was charged and pleaded guilty in Pawnee County District Court to one misdemeanor count of domestic abuse and two misdemeanor counts of assault. He received a one-year suspended sentence and will have to complete a 52-week batterer’s intervention program.
The assault charges were filed after he ran  a vehicle off the road that carried his teenage daughter as a passenger, according to court documents.
The domestic abuse charge resulted from his attempt to gouge out his wife’s eye with his finger over the Thanksgiving holiday last year, according to court documents.
Burns’ letter said his office will continue to serve the district’s constituents until a special election can be called. He also plans to proceed with an interim study on post-traumatic stress disorder.
“I would like to thank my fellow House colleagues who have prayed and supported me and my family during this incredibly difficult time,” Burns’ letter said.
Burns was elected in 2018 to represent House District 35, covering part of Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Noble and Osage counties.
He has worked in law enforcement, teaching, coaching and racing and served 20 years in the military, including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He received a Purple Heart, Bronze Star and a Combat Infantry Badge for his military service, according to his House biography.
“I share his belief that it is best for him and his family to focus on his treatment and rehabilitation at this time,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow. “Domestic violence of any kind cannot and will not be tolerated by the House of Representatives.”

For 60 years, Head Start has provided child care for the most vulnerable children in the United States with little controversy.
It was established by a Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1965, and supported by a slew of Republicans since, including Richard Nixon, who called it “valuable”; Ronald Reagan, who established Head Start Awareness Month in the 1980s; and George H. W. Bush, who increased its funding. Legislators from both parties have supported Head Start, which operates in all 50 states, and is the only child care option available in some rural parts of the country.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

This year, though, politics came to the door of Head Start. Caught in the political crosshairs of the Trump administration, the program is facing unprecedented upheaval that could shutter child care centers and, as many of Head Start experts who spoke to The 19th see it, fundamentally alter the program.
“For me and for a lot of other directors, trust has been deeply broken,” said Jen Bailey, executive director of Reach Dane, which operates 17 child care centers in Wisconsin and offers Head Start services. “The mission is we serve the neediest of the needy and poorest of the poor. For us, changing that would violate the mission of Head Start.”
The program, which now serves about 700,000 children, was created to support low-income families. It provides free child care to children ages 3 to 5 (Early Head Start serves those under 3) and offers a wide array of services for the entire family, including prenatal support, health screenings and connecting parents to job training, housing and food assistance.
But the Trump administration has dealt several financial blows to the program this year. At one point, it looked like Head Start may be eliminated completely.
And more recently, the future of Head Start has been thrown into uncertainty by an unprecedented directive from the administration: Programs are to ban undocumented children from Head Start entirely.
Attorneys general in 21 Democratic-led states have sued the federal government over this rule, and the Department of Health and Human Services has agreed to halt enforcement in those states until Sept. 11. As programs wait for additional guidance on whether they will have to implement that change, the mood is one of unease, confusion and fear, according to interviews with nearly two dozen Head Start experts across the country, including providers, state association directors and federal workers.
There’s a discomfort over just how much the politics of the moment has reached their programs. They don’t want to say anything that could turn D.C.’s attention on them.
At the same time, they are trying to continue to serve Head Start families, knowing that soon, some of them could be barred from it. Because the work they do is so deeply connected with the populations the Trump administration is targeting, they are now weighing a moral dilemma: If Head Start changed, could they stay?
“We would have staff say, ‘I don’t want to work in a program that has this eligibility criteria.’ And I would understand that,” Bailey said.
American kids are less likely to reach adulthood than foreign peers

Already, her centers are seeing dips in attendance from families who are afraid they will get caught in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid as they bring their kids in. About 70,000 undocumented people live in Wisconsin, according to the Migration Policy Institute; Reach Dane’s centers serve some 1,000 children.
Bailey told her staff that although the political rhetoric has changed, their core values have not. Reach Dane is not making any changes until more guidance arrives from Washington. But if they were forced to check for immigration status, she’s not sure she could stay.
“If it came to the point where it could not take care of staff and kids and families at some sort of basic level, I wouldn’t be able to ethically sit in that space,” said Bailey, who has worked in Head Start for 25 years.
Project 2025, the 900-page document from the conservative Heritage Foundation that has turned into a policy blueprint for President Donald Trump’s second term, dedicates one paragraph to Head Start. Citing “rampant abuse” of children and “lack of positive outcomes,” advising: Eliminate Head Start.
While there have been documented cases of abuse and neglect at Head Start programs, it still has one of the most rigorous safety standards in American child care (the incidents affected fewer than 1 in 1,000 children, according to the Administration for Children and Families, the division that oversees Head Start), and the issues are not unique to Head Start. Numerous studies have also found positive outcomes both in the short and long term for children enrolled in the program.
In April, a leaked White House budget showed the Trump administration was angling to eliminate Head Start altogether, claiming it used a “radical” curriculum that gave preference to undocumented children and embraced diversity, equity and inclusion. In response, the National Head Start Association sent an open letter to the president signed by 50,000 Head Start parents and alumni.
The letter-writing campaign would grow to number nearly 500,000, and state Head Start associations also mobilized to speak out against the program’s elimination. Ultimately, it worked. Head Start received flat funding from Congress — what amounts to a budget cut when accounting for inflation.
Federal SNAP cuts put free school meals at risk

Still, the programs have taken economic hits — in some cases, ones they could barely recover from. Shortly after Trump took office at the end of January, funding to programs was cut off as part of a government-wide freeze. At least 45 programs serving nearly 20,000 children across 23 states spent days and weeks waiting for money to come down. The true number is likely much higher, experts said.
April Mullins-Datko, the Head Start director at ADVOCAP, a community action agency in Wisconsin that provides Head Start services, said her funding was delayed for more than a month. They used some reserve funds and took out a line credit to stay open.
“We were limping. Robbing Peter and paying Paul,” said Mullins-Datko, a 20-year Head Start veteran who was a Head Start child herself in the 1980s. Her twins also went through the program.
A Government Accountability Office report released in July found that the Trump administration violated federal law when it withheld funds from programs that had already been approved by Congress. Between Jan. 20 and April 15, Head Start grantees received $825 million less in funding when compared to the same period in 2024.
Another headwind arrived in April. Five of the 10 regional offices that support Head Start and other child care programs suddenly closed as part of a reduction of the federal workforce. All were in blue states. Programs in 22 states lost specialists who helped them navigate challenges with funding, who served as the first points of contact if a safety incident occurred. The remaining offices, which were already shortstaffed, took on entire states’ caseloads.
Katie Hamm, who oversaw the Head Start program in her role as the deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development for the Biden administration, called it “a game of whack-a-mole, where you think you solved a new issue and here comes another one.” Hamm left the role in January.
But what has really rattled Head Start is the change on immigration. Since the new guidance on undocumented children was issued in July, programs have been in something of a holding pattern.
Fundamentally, the guidance redefines Head Start and other HHS programs as a “federal public benefit,” or in other words, welfare. Head Start has never been defined as a form of welfare, said Allison Siebeneck, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, one of the groups suing the federal government over the changes to Head Start. Welfare reform in the 1990s specifically excluded K-12 and early childhood from the definition of a “federal public benefit,” she said: “They could have included it, and they didn’t.”
Redefining Head Start means only U.S. citizens or “qualified aliens” can access the program, excluding undocumented children but also those who are seeking asylum, those with U visas such as victims of serious crimes, those with temporary protected status and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
When the Trump administration published its rule change, it argued that undocumented immigrants “should not burden” our benefits system. The change was effective immediately.
The new rules came with no additional information on how programs are to screen families. Programs are still waiting for implementation guidance from the federal Office of Head Start. Thousands of teachers, parents and Head Start alumni, meanwhile, have submitted comments in the federal registrar responding to the change, many of them condemning it.
The rule change does include an exemption for nonprofits that offer Head Start services, which is about 70% of all programs, but the administration noted that all programs, regardless of the exemption, are encouraged to “pay heed to the clear expressions of national policy” and screen students for immigration status. Siebeneck called it a “thinly veiled threat.”
“You have one statute that says you’re exempt,” she said, “but when you go to sign for your grant you also have to sign a certification saying you’re in compliance with federal law.”
Program directors, who already saw what it was like to suddenly lose funding earlier in the year, are now afraid to lose their grants altogether if they don’t comply with the requirement. Some may comply before exact guidance is released or regardless of nonprofit status.
In Illinois, Lauri Morrison-Frichtl, executive director of the Illinois Head Start Association, said one Head Start director has decided not to enroll children if they find out the family is undocumented.
“They don’t want to do something that gets them in trouble. Our programs follow the rules,” Morrison-Frichtl said. “They are not rule breakers.”

“It’s an odd moment that what we’ve always been doing has now turned into the politics of the moment,” reflected Mullins-Datko, the Head Start program director in Wisconsin. “We can usually find common ground with our children no matter what our politics are because typically we all want the same things for our children: We want them to thrive, we want them to be healthy, we want them to get a good education — that’s why Head Start has enjoyed bipartisan support throughout its history.”
Many Head Start providers would love to return to a time when Head Start wasn’t political, when their primary concern was how to better serve the families and children in their care with the resources they had. Others feel like the mission of Head Start — to protect those most in need — has moved them to speak up at a time when those communities are being targeted.
“Head Start has been around for 11 administrations and 60 years and have never seen these types of asks of us changing our approach to eligibility and enrollment, despite Congress having a lot of opportunities to do that,” said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association.
The national group is in touch with members across both sides of the aisle who support Head Start. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Sheridan said, has expressed support for the program, saying in May that he would “be very sad” if programs shut their doors and adding that he “fought very hard to make sure Head Start gets all of its funding next year.” Nevertheless, the changes to Head Start have taken place under Kennedy’s leadership at HHS.
It’s now a matter of, “How do we move Head Start out of the way of politics?” Sheridan said.
In Indiana, Rhett Cecil, the head of the state’s Head Start Association, is also trying to keep the conversation nonpartisan.
“There’s no agenda in Head Start,” he said.“I find it remarkably refreshing in a polarized society.”
More change ahead for New Orleans public schools 20 years after Katrina

Cecil is waiting for guidance on implementing the immigration change from the federal Office of Head Start, but said it’s not something his members have thought through much yet. “Our programs will adhere to the standards of Head Start,” he said. About 100,000 undocumented immigrants live in Indiana, putting it in the middle of the pack among states in terms of population.
“Here’s what’s changed in Indiana,” Cecil said: “Nothing.”
Megan Woller, the executive director of the Idaho Head Start Association, said providers in her state are worried about scaring families away and bringing too much attention to Head Start.
“Idaho is a political climate that is right in line with the Trump administration. My state association colleagues across the country who all live in different political climates are advocating in very vocal ways and are banding together,” Woller said. “My members have not wanted to do that. There is a fear of being too vocal and causing a big stink and putting too much focus on Head Start.”
But in other parts of the country, programs have been moved to speak up. Four Head Start state associations and two parent organizations are named plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump administration. All are blue or purple states — Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Oregon and California.
In more conservative states, few programs and Head Start Associations were willing to speak to The 19th about this year’s changes. But for some in red states the immigration directive feels like a step too far.
Julie Stone, who leads the Ohio Head Start Association, said the immigration change represents a fundamental shift for programs.
“We are about meeting families where they are. We are about doing what’s right for children,” Stone said. “We’ve never been required to establish their status, but we know their parents are working and we know we have them in a safe and nourishing environment.”
And ICE enforcement is only ramping up. The agency’s annual budget is set to triple. That makes her anxious, “knowing there will be more enforcement and we are somehow … getting wrapped up in this,” Stone said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Multiple programs and state Head Start agencies told The 19th that the political rhetoric around immigration is distorting the reality of who the families who rely on Head Start are, what they contribute to their communities and why the program is needed.
“What I know to be true about Head Start: The majority of [the families] go to work,” said Jennie Mauer, the head of the Wisconsin Head Start Association. Many of those undocumented families in her state work in the dairy industry, which relies on migrant workers to operate. Those workers, an estimated 70% of the dairy workforce, need somewhere to put their children.
Otherwise, how will the Dairy State continue to be the Dairy State?
“We can have all that [political] rhetoric, but I want safe communities and I want safe children,” Mauer said. “I do not believe that coming to Head Start and putting these questions to families who are just trying to go to work is the way to do it.”
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

In Detroit, this year of upheaval has already led to the closure of a Head Start program, leaving 324 children without child care.
The center, called Focus: HOPE, had been receiving Head Start funding as part of a consortium of three programs. Last year, the consortium disbanded and each program applied individually. CEO Portia Roberson said her program tried to put together a grant application that aligned with the priorities of the new administration, noting that it served “all” children.
They were supposed to hear back about their grant in March, but nothing came. Michigan was one of the states that lost its regional office in April, meaning the staff that ensured grants were evenly spaced so communities didn’t lose Head Start services were gone.
By July 31, still not having heard anything, the money ran dry. Focus: HOPE laid off nearly 100 staff members and announced the closure of their Head Start services. Roberson expected parents to be angry with her. But instead, she said, “they were here to figure out how they could support what we are doing and to let people know how important we are for their families.”
In mid-August, the program learned its grant application had been denied. No explanation was given at first — they later learned that one of the providers in the consortium, Starfish Family Services, had received the funding Focus: HOPE expected to go to them.
“The current administration talks about wanting to build a workforce. My question is how do parents become a part of this workforce if there is no safe and educational place to put their children?” she said. Now, “I’m taking people out of the workforce.”
Roberson is hoping Starfish will take them back in as a subgrantee, which will allow her to service the families in their care. If that happens, she will then have to consider what those services would look like with the new immigration changes.
“What gets lost in all of this is we are just trying to help people who need help. We are not making decisions around race or class or political party,” she said. “
She doesn’t know how she could enforce the immigration directive. If it came down to protecting children from being removed, Roberson said, Focus: HOPE would do “whatever needs to be done.”

(Photo illustration by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The Trump administration’s accusation that South Dakota’s federally grant-funded sex education materials contain “gender ideology” is not accurate, according to state officials, while advocates for transgender people are condemning the federal government’s demand to remove language referencing them.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent letters on the topic this week to 40 states, including South Dakota. The department said the states could lose a total of $81.3 million in remaining funds from the Personal Responsibility Education Program, or PREP, if they do not eliminate instances of “gender ideology” from grant-funded sexual education materials within 60 days. South Dakota stands to lose $606,410, according to the department. 
US Health and Human Services orders states, including SD, to strip gender from sex ed

The policy appears to target references to transgender or nonbinary people. Transgender people have a gender identity that doesn’t match their sex assigned at birth. Nonbinary people don’t identify as strictly male or female.
In the letter to South Dakota’s Department of Health, the language identified for removal includes a definition of the term “transgender,” discussion prompts about why a person would identify as transgender, and an explanation of sexuality as “complex” and “difficult to define,” among other examples.
A spokeswoman for the state department, Tia Kafka, responded with emailed statements to questions from South Dakota Searchlight. She said grant-funded programming in the state utilizes material from Wyman, a nationwide nonprofit based in Missouri. Kafka acknowledged that the Wyman materials may contain content that the Trump administration deems objectionable, but she said the state does not include that particular content in the programming it offers.
“We are working with our federal partners to make sure that is clear,” Kafka wrote. “The state will respond to the letter within the 60 days notifying our federal partners that we do not have gender ideology concepts or terminology in our programming.”
Wyman CEO and President Allison Williams said in an emailed statement to Searchlight that the nonprofit’s curriculum is “a nationally recognized, evidence-based youth development program providing teens with the tools and opportunities to build life and leadership skills, strengthen relationships, avoid risky behaviors and engage with their communities.” She said the “curriculum includes 140 lessons centered in positive youth development providing flexibility in the lessons partners choose to provide.”

The four-page letter from the federal government says it asked the state in April to provide curricula and programmatic materials “in use or in any way relevant” to the grant program. The letter says the state provided the material, and the federal Administration for Children and Families reviewed it and identified content that “falls outside of the scope” of the grant program’s authorizing law. The letter goes on to provide multiple examples.
A South Dakota Department of Health webpage devoted to PREP grant programming says the state has received the funding since 2010. The program “aims to educate young people on abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS,” the webpage says. The program is intended for youth ages 10-19 who are pregnant or parenting, homeless, in foster care, in rural areas, or in geographic areas with high teen birth rates. Additional program training covers topics including healthy relationships, positive adolescent development, financial literacy and parent-child communication.
The webpage says the state awarded a contract to Lutheran Social Services to implement an evidence-based program. A search of the state’s financial information website, OpenSD, yields two contracts identifying Lutheran Social Services as the sub-recipient of a total of $427,500 in funding for the program since June 2024.
Lutheran Social Services, when contacted by Searchlight, deferred all questions to the state Department of Health.
A program evaluation report published by the state department says PREP programming reached a total of 224 youth in Sioux Falls and Rapid City during the 2024 fiscal year. Locations for PREP programming identified in the report were Lutheran Social Services’ Arise East and Arise West youth centers, its New Alternatives independent living program in Rapid City, the Juvenile Services Center in Rapid City and Juvenile Detention Center in Sioux Falls, the Wellfully treatment center in Rapid City, and ACE Academy in Sioux Falls.

Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, criticized the Trump administration’s threat to cancel grant funding, calling it an attack not only on transgender and nonbinary people but also anyone challenging traditional views of gender and sexuality.
“The policy seeks to force people into narrow, outdated definitions of male and female tied to rigid, 1950s-style gender roles,” Chapman said. 
She added that the policy will harm young people by denying them knowledge and support.
Cody Ingle, a doctoral student in public health in South Dakota and an LGBTQ+ advocate, said the federal policy reflects a misunderstanding of gender, science and public health, reducing complex identities to rigid, binary definitions. He said transgender and nonbinary people have always existed and that increased visibility today reflects greater safety and acceptance, not an “ideology” being pushed onto kids.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-from-feds-e1756490393140-1024x637.png,,,2025-08-30 11:57:28.278725

The Trump administration has agreed to release $184 million for AmeriCorps, the federal agency for service and volunteerism, after a coalition of 22 attorneys general and two governors sued in April.
The coalition, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, challenged the administration’s plans to eliminate 90% of AmeriCorps’ workforce, cancel contracts and close $400 million worth of programs the agency supports, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha’s office said in a statement.
“Within one week, our coalition has clawed back billions in federal funding, unlawfully withheld by the Trump Administration, for the people of our states,” Neronha said.
AmeriCorps, signed into law in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, places roughly 200,000 members across the United States at 35,000 service locations, according to current agency data. The program funds and places volunteers in local national organizations that address critical community needs and provides support for organizations to recruit and supervise volunteers. Members serve in schools, local governments and with a wide range of nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.
“Over the past eight months, one of the questions posed most often by Rhode Island constituents and media members alike concerns the effectiveness of our fight against the illegal actions of this Administration,” Neronha said. “The proof is in the pudding. Without these lawsuits, the residents of our states would be deprived of critical federal funding sources upon which they rely to live their lives. And unfortunately for the residents of those states with Republican attorneys general, many of those funding sources remain off. We won’t capitulate, we won’t back down, and we will continue this fight for the well-being of everyday Americans who just want a government that works for them.”
In Rhode Island, AmeriCorps programs are administered and supported by ServeRI and service members worked at more than 100 locations across the state—supporting schools, food banks, homeless shelters, youth centers, veterans’ facilities, and other essential community institutions. Their efforts generated over $2.6 million in additional local resources from businesses, foundations, public agencies, and other sources in Rhode Island, Neronha’s office said.
Shapiro said in a statement that the White House Office of Management and Budget is “finally releasing the $6 million owed to Pennsylvania to help our seniors, support our schools, and more.”
The frozen funding has created uncertainty for AmeriCorps programs across the country. In Pennsylvania, the agency funds 132 programs that deliver services in more than 1,000 locations. AmeriCorps invested $54.8 million in the commonwealth in 2023, but 32 grants were canceled as a result of Trump administration cuts this year.
In June, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated hundreds of AmeriCorps programs that were unlawfully canceled and barred the agency from making further cuts without going through a formal rulemaking process.
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), however, continued to withhold more than $184 million for service programs for seniors and those awarded highly competitive federal grants. The coalition filed an amended lawsuit in July and requested another preliminary injunction to release the remaining funds, Neronha’s office said.
The Trump administration’s deadline to respond was Thursday.
“Rather than oppose the states’ motion, the administration instead informed the court that OMB would release all withheld AmeriCorps funds … which AmeriCorps will distribute to programs nationwide, as quickly as possible,” Neronha’s office said in a statement.
Participating attorneys general were from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. The governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania also participated in filing the lawsuit.

(Credit: Highland Copper Company Inc.)Following the passage of the Michigan House of Representatives’ budget proposal for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, opponents of a controversial mining project are slamming the plan for a $50 million allocation aimed at preparing local communities for the project. 
Put forth in a request from Rep. Greg Markannen (R-Hancock), the Republican budget allocates $50 million to Wakefield Township in Gogebic County to invest into road upgrades, fortification of the electrical grid and improvements to telecommunication services across the region. 
“Site readiness, or lack thereof, is commonly cited as a factor in investment decisions by businesses and venture funds considering Michigan-based opportunities,” Markannen said in his request for legislative spending in May. 
He noted that “an opportunity before the Township offers a generational opportunity to create hundreds of good-paying jobs to support local families and bolster the national supply chain and defense capabilities,” a reference to Highland Copper’s Copperwood Mine, but noted site investment is needed to encourage investment in the area.
While the state’s Strategic Fund Board approved $50 million for the mining project last year, the funding was held up in the Michigan Senate, when the Appropriations Committee adjourned for the year without voting on the funding. 
While some state and community officials have welcomed the project, the mine has received push back from multiple environmental groups who are raising concerns about the underground mine and its proximity to the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, the North Country Trail, and Lake Superior.

Leading the charge is Protect the Porkies, a grassroots group led by Tom Grotewohl, a resident of Wakefield Township. 
In a statement released Thursday, Grotewohl denounced the inclusion of funding for the mine within the House Republican’s budget proposal. 
“Make no mistake, this funding request is identical in purpose to the $50 million Michigan Strategic Fund-approved SOAR grant twice halted last year due to pushback from around the state and nation,” Grotehwol said. “Considering Speaker Matt Hall’s [(R-Richland Township)] commitment to transparency, it’s surprising that he and his colleagues would include a corporate welfare handout thinly veiled as a community infrastructure grant to Wakefield Township.”
Earlier this summer, Highland Copper, the Canadian company developing the mine, pointed to Wakefield Township’s request for legislative funding as an alternative route in receiving infrastructure funding for the project. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“If one path is successful, the other will no longer be required,” the company said in a July 2 news release.
However, Jane Fitkin, director of Citizens for a Safe & Clean Lake Superior, argued that if the project is to move forward, Highland Copper should be the one footing the bill – not Michigan taxpayers. 
Chief among environmental advocates’ concerns is the location of the mine’s tailings basin, which would store mining waste on sloping topography leading into Lake Superior. Should the dam collapse, several toxins including arsenic, cadmium, selenium, lead and mercury would be released into the waterway. 
This contamination would infringe on the treaty rights of several Native American tribes to hunt, fish and gather within the territory ceded in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe.
In a statement, Highland Copper called the project a “once-in-a-generation project” saying the grant would be used to fund infrastructure that’s needed to bring to life projects like the Copperwood Mine and more.

Wakefield Township Supervisor Mandy Lake applauded the Legislature for “prioritizing the Western Upper Peninsula and demonstrating its commitment to giving our community a future.” 
“The infrastructure funded through this grant will have a tremendous positive impact on our whole region, and while it will support a great opportunity like Copperwood, it will also support our logging industry, and better our position to attract more business opportunities as well,” Lake told the Advance in an email. 
Marty Fittante, CEO of Invest UP, a regional economic organization based in the Upper Peninsula, similarly cheered the inclusion of funding within the House’s budget proposal, comparing the effort to the Eagle Mine in  Marquette County – which has drawn similar concerns from the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community alongside environmental advocates. 
According to its website, the mine employs roughly 400 people with a 75% local hire commitment. 
“We know firsthand from the success of Eagle Mine and its regulation under Michigan’s stringent mining standards, environmental stewardship and economic opportunity can be complementary to one another,” Fittante said. “This infrastructure funding will pave the way not just for the Copperwood Mine, a project that will create good paying jobs in a community that desperately needs them, but will also support the forest products industry which is also a critical opportunity for the region.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Michigan-Air-Use-Permit-Permit-to-Install-Application-for-Copperwood-Resources-Inc.png,,,2025-08-30 10:56:56.369061

The federal government this month issued a stop-work order on the company's Revolution Wind project, which was 80% complete. (Photo courtesy Ørsted)This week the Trump Administration signaled its intention to reconsider the approval of a federal permit for the US Wind farm off  the Maryland coast. As a longtime resident and business owner in Ocean City, I’m one of thousands of local citizens applauding this decision.
The lobbying and PR machine of US Wind has been going full steam ahead with its campaign to sell the state and the citizens of Maryland with a pro-environment, pro-economy narrative. On these pages recently the CEO of Oceantic Network, which is supported by the offshore wind industry, hailed the merits of the US Wind project with promises of economic benefits for the state.
But there is another side to this story. Our beautiful coastline is at risk of being permanently defaced with the blight of over 900  foot towers 11 miles off our shore. The negative impact on the Maryland Eastern Shore will be devastating, threatening offshore sea life, the livelihoods of waterman and fisheries, and the economic engine that drives everything in our community – tourism.
US Wind touts model-based statistical projections alleging new jobs being created, money being invested, and savings to electric ratepayers. These data points are not based in reality but rather on projections and promises.
But for us locally, we’ve been asking: At what cost?

What will be the cost to the waterman who will lose valuable fishing grounds to the disruption of the marine ecosystem? The wind industry has acknowledged this with attempts to “compensate” fisherman with multimillion-dollar packages set aside for fisherman. But these are lifelong pursuits and multigenerational businesses. These fishermen don’t want a handout – they want to fish.
What will be the cost to Maryland ratepayers who will see their electricity rates rise? The Maryland Public Service Commission has already established a “cost cap” on rates to protect customers when offshore wind comes online. Their models anticipate added costs for ratepayers, not savings, with electric bills rising up to $300 per household and by as much as 10-20% for Maryland businesses.
What will be the cost to homeowners in Ocean City and across Worcester County? They will see their home values plummet in the face of rising property taxes and service fees to support this new “industry” and potential declines in market demand for their homes.
What will be the cost to the wildlife that now thrives off the coast of Maryland and Delaware? There is substantial scientific evidence that offshore wind rigs destroy habitat and displace species from their natural environments due to construction, underwater noise and electromagnetic fields. The risk to whales and other marine mammals is painfully evident when endangered North Atlantic right whales wash ashore.
And finally, what will be the cost to our tourism and hospitality industry when the negative impact of offshore wind development keeps tourists away? The hotels, restaurants, shop owners and support services are the lifeblood of our community. I’m a small business owner in Ocean City. If our businesses fail our families will suffer and the city and county will lose tens of millions in tax revenue that sustains our schools and public works.
Tourism revenue generated on the Maryland coast accounts for a huge economic contribution to the state. To put that multibillion-dollar benefit at risk for the questionable promises of a heavily subsidized offshore wind industry is insane.
The Ocean City and Worcester County governments have given their public and financial support for community led groups like StopOffshoreWind.com. They are standing up for our community rights and interests and have pushed the federal government to cancel the permits for the US Wind project.
It looks like the federal government is waking to the reality of what these offshore wind farms will really cost. If the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management follows through with canceling the US Wind permits it will be encouraging for our local community.
The threat won’t go away. The wind industry has plenty of legal and lobbying firepower. But we aren’t going away either.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.
Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.




DOT yanks funding for ‘doomed’ wind projects
Offshore wind projects already struggling against a Trump administration onslaught got more bad news Friday when the U.S. Department of Transportation said it was pulling $679 million in infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country.
Among the casualties: $47.3 million for the Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project, which was backed by US Wind, the developer behind a proposed wind farm off of Ocean City. That facility was expected to provide the massive steel towers that support the wind turbines, along with other steel components, for the US Wind project and to eventually serve “the entire U.S. offshore wind market on the East Coast.”
Supporters said the facility was expected to provide 530 direct jobs when fully functional on the site of the former Bethlehem Steel, a once-massive steel factory.
The feds also pulled an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.
“The Quonset Development Corporation is disappointed by this decision but understands that this administration is working to fund projects in line with its current policy priorities,” Steven King, managing director for the quasi-public state agency, said in an emailed response Friday.
“Given that the Quonset Business Park’s 250 companies work broadly across nearly every sector of the economy, including in shipbuilding, we believe there is common ground to pursue and look forward to working together on new grant projects that align with the administration’s objectives and that grow the economy,” his statement said.
Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee was not as forgiving, saying in a statement late Friday that the decision “undermines progress on critical infrastructure and threatens Rhode Island’s economic and energy future.”
“The Port of Davisville and the broader Quonset Business Park are vital hubs for manufacturing, shipping, and energy, including the state’s offshore wind industry. This funding would have modernized port infrastructure and expanded cargo capacity,” McKee said. “By withdrawing it, the Trump administration is undermining a high-performing port that drives real economic output, strengthens regional supply chains, and plays a central role in advancing energy and long-term growth for Rhode Island and across the Northeast.”




“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”
The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.
“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”
The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.
Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
Stuck in limbo
Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.
“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”
Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.
Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.
“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”
More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.
The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.
Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”
The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.
Trump administration plans to revoke federal approval for Ocean City wind farm

Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line.
“For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders,” his statement said. “We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”
The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”










We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on. We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.


– Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, on millwrights stranded at sea


Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.
The judge is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing, but. will likely issue a ruling at a later, unscheduled date.

This year Washington, DC is the host city for the WorldPride 2025 celebration, a global celebration of the LGBTQ community that coincides with the 50th anniversary of the city’s first Pride parade; the three-week WorldPride festival has drawn thousands to events across the capital despite lingering concerns about LGBTQ rights under President Trump. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
  ‘The world has changed’ 

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
More states pass laws restricting transgender people’s bathroom use

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.



Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
  Free speech argument 

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
 

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
  A Republican loss 

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

State records indicate clinical nurse Laura Williams was fired by Waterloo’s Covenant Medical Center on April 24, 2025, for allegedly violating the company’s sexual harassment policies. Williams had worked for the hospital since March 2021.
According to testimony at Williams’ recent unemployment hearing, she was having a private conversation with two colleagues at work when she indicated that her boyfriend had his penis pierced and was then in the process of giving her a tattoo on her buttocks.

After one of the co-workers asked to see the tattoo and the piercing, Williams allegedly showed her colleague a photo of her boyfriend’s penis and also pulled down her pants to show what had so far been tattooed on her buttocks.
One of the nurses who saw the photo and the tattoo reported the incident to the hospital administration. When asked about the matter by hospital management, Williams allegedly explained that she believed her co-workers had wanted to see the body art. No patients were present at the time, she explained, adding that she believed she had been having an amusing conversation with friends.
Covenant Medical Center concluded Williams had violated the hospital’s sexual harassment policy and fired her immediately.
Administrative Law Judge Duane Golden presided over the subsequent hearing on Williams’ application for unemployment benefits. Golden concluded that Williams’ conduct amounted to a “willful or wanton disregard of employer’s interest” and represented a “deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of employees.”
Golden denied Williams’ application for unemployment benefits based on a finding of job-related misconduct.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans are much more overweight than they used to be, with adult obesity rates nearly tripled since 1991, according to a new state report.
The 2025 Alaska Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report, part of a series of documents published every five years by the Alaska Department of Health, shows a continued trend toward poorer physical fitness even though Alaskans have taken some steps toward improvement.
Alaskans are drinking fewer sugary drinks and exercising more, but that wasn’t enough to keep obesity rates from rising, the data shows. 
The long-term slide will likely take a lot of time and effort to reverse, said Katie Reilly, the Alaska Division of Public Health’s physical activity and nutrition unit manager.
“I feel like these contradictions and trends really just highlight what a complex and challenging issue this is,” said Reilly, one of the main authors of this year’s report.
The results help confirm what public health managers stress in their programs: that “no single behavior strategy or program alone will increase physical activity or improve nutrition or decrease unhealthy weight and its related consequences,” she said. “It’s really going to take a comprehensive approach.”
For now, the statistics are mostly negative.

 A graph shows how the prevalence of obesity among Alaska adults has increased since 1993. The graph is from the Alaska Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report, 2025 Update. (Graph provided by Alaska Division of Public Health/Alaska Department of Health)

A third of Alaska adults were overweight in 2023 and another 36% were classified as obese, while only 29% were at a healthy weight and 2% were considered underweight. That is a big change since the early 1990s, when only 13% of Alaska adults were obese and about half were classified as being at a healthy weight, according to the report.
The latest Alaska obesity rate is slightly lower than the national 40.3% rate reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last September. However, unlike the Alaska rate, the national obesity rate has declined slightly in the last few years.
Determining what has changed since the 1990s is complicated, Reilly said.
One factor is the increasing sedentary nature of daily life, she said. “Today we have fewer opportunities to move, and we spend more time sitting at our desks or driving our cars and in front of screens,” she said.
Healthier foods can be harder to find, especially in rural communities, and food labels can be misleading, encouraging people to consume less-healthful products, she said.
The good news about Alaska adults is that they have boosted their physical activity, according to the report. About two-thirds of Alaska adults are meeting U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommendations for aerobic activity and about 45% are meeting the federal recommendations for muscle-strengthening activity, the report said. The federal recommendation is for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week and at least two days a week of strengthening activity.
While Alaskans’ physical activity improvement may be slowing the increase in obesity and related problems, “we have not turned the tide yet, and that is the goal,” Reilly said.
Among children, from preschoolers to teenagers, the statistics are better than those for adults, but there are still increases in obesity and lower-than-recommended levels of exercise.

Among Alaska high school students, for example, 64% were at a healthy weight in 2023, 16% were overweight and 17% were obese, the report said. Fewer than one in five high schoolers got the recommended 60 minutes a day of physical exercise, and – as the case is with Alaska adults — fewer than one in 10 ate the recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables, the report said.
Consumption of sugary beverages is significantly down across most age groups, the report said. For example, 76% of 3-year-olds did not drink any sugary beverages daily in 2022, an improvement from the 57% rate in 2008, the report said.
Reilly said the state’s Play Every Day program, which includes messaging about the dangers of sugary beverages, appears to have helped inspire Alaskans to cut back their sugary beverage consumption.
The Play Every Day program is run by the Physical Activity and Nutrition Program in partnership with the nonprofit Healthy Futures.
Other programs that are available include the Division of Public Health’s Fresh Start program, which pairs participants with coaches to encourage healthier lifestyles that include better diets, more exercise and other steps to prevent chronic health problems.
There is also a federal grant program to help communities be more pedestrian-friendly and therefore better places for outdoor physical activity, Reilly said. Representatives of Bethel, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Sitka, Fairbanks and the Kenai Peninsula participated earlier this year in the Alaska Walkability Action Institute, she said.
The federally funded program brings together transportation planners and health experts to work on ways to improve pedestrian and bicycling opportunities.
Data used in the Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report came from a variety of health-monitoring surveys, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which has been operating continuously since 1991, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Childhood Understanding Behaviors Survey and others. Data also came from school districts and regional organizations.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC05024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-30 09:56:31.698352

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotas. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

An American flag has been strategically placed on one of the massive beams supporting the Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, part of the New Orleans region hurricane and storm damage risk reduction system.
Completed in 2009 to close off the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, the barrier is designed to decrease damage to the metropolitan area when a major hurricane pushes water from the Gulf of Mexico into the lakes that surround the city and neighboring parishes.
The flag on the wall symbolizes pride and mourning, a reminder of the people it protects and a memorial for those who died 20 years ago when Hurricane Katrina hit. The failure of the federal levee system Aug. 29, 2005, claimed more than a thousand lives, displaced nearly a million people in the region and left permanent scars on New Orleans.

A go-to term emerged to praise New Orleanians and their neighbors who persevered through the catastrophe and took part in the unprecedented rebuilding: resilient. But as various recovery programs faltered and efforts to ensure disaster history would not repeat itself stalled, “resilient” or “resiliency” now elicit  bitter feelings among locals.
“I think people have gotten tired of the word. Not just because it’s become cliché, but because people have begun to understand it as an excuse for lack of preparation or execution, lack of planning or execution,” said Michael Hecht, CEO and president of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional economic development group.
Hecht came to Louisiana in 2006 from New York, where he led a 9/11 small business recovery program for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. After directing the state’s post-Katrina business recovery efforts, he was chosen to lead GNO Inc. in 2008.
“We had been knocked down by an unprecedented event,” Hecht said. “It was either be resilient or die, so we were resilient.”
The world has watched as New Orleans fundamentally changed, having lost a significant portion of its Black working class and attracting an upsurge in mostly white transplants from out of state. With more than 484,000 residents before Katrina, the city’s population plummeted below 344,000 in the 2010 census. The number climbed above 391,000 in 2020 and has since fallen about 4% as of 2024, according to various estimates.
Most who have stayed are ardent defenders of the city’s culture, of which resiliency fatigue is quickly becoming a feature. It’s reflected in Louisiana’s slow progress to rebuild coastal land and  improve the adaptability of cities to match what post-Katrina boosters envisioned.

Restoration resistance

After Katrina, more emphasis was placed on rebuilding Louisiana’s vanishing coastal wetlands to protect residents from the increasing threat of hurricanes. A state Coastal Master Plan has taken shape over the past two decades, gaining official approval in 2023, to tie together restoration efforts and shield wetlands from sea level rise, subsidence and worsening hurricanes.
“We learned from Hurricane Katrina that levees alone aren’t enough,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with National Wildlife Foundation. “We also need a healthy natural ecosystem sitting out in front of those levees to protect the structures that protect our communities.”
But the master plan encountered a huge setback in July with the end of what had been its keystone project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. Gov. Jeff Landry led pushback against the project for its feared impact on fisheries and nearly $3 billion price tag.
So far, the state’s Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority has spent $600 million to harness the power of the Mississippi River to bring fresh water and sediment to wetlands in the Barataria Basin – only to shelve the diversion.
“It was probably one of the most innovative, forward-thinking things in terms of being a resilience hub for the world,” said Amanda Moore, senior director for the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf program.
A lifetime Gulf Coast resident, Moore moved to New Orleans from the Tampa, Florida, area in 2009 to take a job as a community organizer with the National Wildlife Federation. She joined the wave of thinkers, scientists and planners who came to the city after Katrina with the hope of bringing relief from the constant threat of flood.
“For people who live on the Gulf Coast – and especially South Louisiana – it’s exhausting,” she said.
The federation was among the voices that influenced upgrades to the region’s storm risk reduction system in the years after Katrina. Moore led efforts such as the MRGO Must Go Coalition, advocating for reversal of wetlands damage attributed to saltwater intrusion from the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet.
“You’re helping to alleviate maybe some of that exhaustion that people are personally feeling when you do the coastal restoration,” Moore said. “You’re adding this layer of protection, you’re helping it create a healthier environment that’s safer, so that does help people really be more resilient and not burnt out.”

Funding momentum peters out

As Katrina and its aftermath garnered worldwide attention, the recovery money streamed in from Washington and charitable foundations. The federal government directed $76 billion to Louisiana projects.
But keeping up the pace of investment after post-disaster attention spans waned became a problem for state and local leaders. Even with billions of dollars put into infrastructure, billions more would be needed for upkeep and replacing outdated systems. Stormwater drainage and drinking water in New Orleans, for example, rely on a power supply and mains that, in many spots, are more than a century old.
Charles Allen, Gulf Coast community engagement director for the National Audubon Society, recalls the vast amounts of federal and philanthropic dollars directed to the region in the years immediately after Katrina – and the dropoff that followed. It revealed the inability of state and local governments to sustain the level of rebuilding needed.
“It’s like anything in life, you know?” Allen said. “We gotta maintain our bodies, and we have to invest in whatever it takes to do that.”
The 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon just off the Southeast Louisiana coast reopened wounds in the region that had yet to heal from Katrina’s trauma. Like the levee failures after the hurricane, It was considered another manmade, preventable disaster. Eleven crew members were killed, and the catastrophic oil spill tainted wildlife and habitat in all five Gulf Coast states. Livelihoods that depended on the Gulf were sidetracked for months, if not ended entirely.
Petroleum giant BP, which contracted the drillship, reached a $20 billion settlement with the federal government and impacted states. In Louisiana, it provided the long-sought financial foundation for its coastal master plan.
But with the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion shelved – and seemingly no other major restoration projects in the queue – Allen and others with vested interest in coastal flood protection fear Louisiana has become dependent on disaster recovery funding to pay for critical infrastructure that should already be in place.
“Let’s not wait for another storm because then it’s always too late when that happens,” Allen said  “You gotta invest in it, you gotta support it, you’ve got to fund it.”
“It’s a lot of reactive disaster-related funding that’s allowing Louisiana to do this work,” Moore said. “We’ve got to figure out how to get out of that cycle.”

‘People can just be people’
Katrina recovery funds paid for upgrades to the massive pumping stations at the end of New Orleans’ outfall drainage canals that pump stormwater into Lake Pontchartrain. Beyond that, however, the city hasn’t engineered a way to handle street flooding from routine heavy rainstorms.
One project was held up as a way for New Orleans to adapt to the regular influx of rainwater, rather than fruitlessly attempt to pump it away. The Gentilly Resilience District called for turning neutral grounds in the neighborhood into retention areas. Residents would be encouraged to add features such as rain cisterns and permeable driveways, with grants to cover their cost.
The centerpiece of the district was the Mirabeau Water Garden, planned for 25 acres of land that were once home to a Catholic convent. The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph donated the land to the city in 2015 on the condition it be used to enhance and protect the neighborhood. It was designed to divert and hold up to 10 million gallons of stormwater in ponds and constructed wetlands, with a pedestrian path and other amenities to invite the public into the space.
The architecture firm Waggonner and Ball designed the water garden using best practices for how to integrate water into a coastal urban setting. The idea came out of a trans-Atlantic collaboration after Katrina called the Dutch Dialogues, in which New Orleans experts tapped into the Netherlands’ experience living with water.
The federal government provided $141 million to the city in 2017 to bring the Gentilly Resilience District to life, with a completion date set for September 2022. But as of 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development noted that only 15% of the money had been spent. The water garden remains largely unfinished.
HUD’s inspector general designated the city a “slow spender” in a project audit, noting that its elements “did not always improve the program participants’ ability to withstand future extreme events.”

In addition to his role with GNO Inc., Hecht was named chairman of the governor’s committee to prepare New Orleans for the 2025 Super Bowl, played in February at the Superdome. Part of Hecht’s charge was to track progress on city infrastructure projects. And while the Gentilly Resilience District is well outside the city’s tourist zone, its lack of progress was noticeable.
“It’s happening. It’s been accepted as a concept, but it’s been extremely slow,” Hecht said. “And that’s just been execution failure, oftentimes on the part of the city.”
The communications team for the city of New Orleans did not respond to a request for comment on the timeline of finishing the Mirabeau Water Gardens.
The Mirabeau Water Garden’s status is considered by residents to be symbolic of New Orleans falling well short of the post-Katrina vision that boasted resilience as a key component of its new economy. Much like the Netherlands, it was thought that the Crescent City could become a beacon of expertise for how to adapt to climate change.
“We thought we were going to be able to really build a sector around selling our experience post Katrina with water management and environmental management around the world,” Hecht said. “If we’re being honest, it has not materialized much as part of our economy.”
It has happened in a small way, he said, citing the Water Institute in Baton Rouge. The independent research center focuses on the Mississippi River Delta and Gulf Coast, and it has applied its expertise to several projects in the region.
“But I think there’s still a lot more,” Hecht said.
Allen believes the opportunity to make Louisiana that hub of water management and resilience still exists, but he acknowledged it is still far from materializing 20 years after Katrina.
“This story of restoration, it’ll never end, which is a good thing,” Allen said. “This kind of work fuels jobs, environmental research and teaching.”
Until or unless that sector develops, the vulnerability of southeast Louisiana to future disasters will continue to place a strain on its residents, observers say, and climate change only heightens that risk.
“That is the goal … building structures, either literally or metaphorically, strong enough so that in a world with climate change and weather volatility, when things happen, either natural or man made, we don’t have to be resilient,” Hecht said.
Renfro, the coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation, said it’s wrong to keep placing the same burden of recovery on a population forced to accept conditions beyond their control.
“Asking the same people again and again to be resilient … it feels unfair,” she said. “People can just be people, and infrastructure can be resilient.”

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.
Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

A new study found that many telemedicine patients have a hard time filling their buprenorphine prescriptions at pharmacies. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nearly a third of telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder had to go without buprenorphine because they had trouble filling their prescription at a pharmacy, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.
Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.
Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.
The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.
In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.
The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.
Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.
The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Pennsylvania also contributed. In their conflict of interest disclosures, some of the authors reported holding equity in Workit Health.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Republican Party reversed course this month on its endorsement policy for primary races involving multiple GOP candidates. 
The party’s decision to step out of its recent habit of endorsing in contested primaries could close an era of party politics when many internal fights between old-guard conservatives and the populist right were on public display.

It comes after the state party in 2024 endorsed Republican challengers to Nebraska’s five GOP incumbents in Congress. The party eventually endorsed the federal delegation for the general election, but only after the incumbents had handily won contested primaries.
The GOP’s new endorsement policy prohibits the state party, party officers and staff from endorsing one Republican over another in contested elections. Party leaders and the state GOP can only endorse in races with one Republican. 
“The Nebraska Republican Party is united and focused on growth, voter contact, and electing Republicans at every level,” Nebraska Republican Party Chair Mary Jane Truemper said in a statement. 
The policy was approved in a GOP State Central Committee meeting held in Lincoln, but closed to reporters. Attendees said the GOP discussed party funding woes, a proposed code of conduct and approved a resolution that would allow the state GOP to “collaborate” with or boost specific ballot initiatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, including one that would ban abortion outright.
Truemper said in a statement that by “returning to the pre-1990 practice of not endorsing in contested primaries, the Nebraska Republican Party is reaffirming that our role is to support every Republican who steps forward to run.”

Retiring Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon told the Examiner the party’s policy changes are because the state GOP “shot themselves in both feet in 2024 by endorsing against the federal delegation in the primary.” He said it was about trying to correct a decision that drove away many party donors. Bacon was one of the incumbents the Nebraska GOP endorsed against during the 2024 primary.
“This is a belated attempt to fix, as well as an improvement from the last 2 years,” Bacon said. “Most state GOP organizations support their incumbents. Having the state and county parties help with reelection makes campaigning easier, but we learned we needed to win with our own separate organizations.”
The party is still trying to repair its relationship with some of the delegation. It recently held a community roundtable in Scottsbluff, which had Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith as a panelist.

People attending the NEGOP State Central Committee meeting on Aug 16 told the Examiner  the rule change initially proposed that county parties also couldn’t endorse during primaries, but that part was removed after public pushback. Party leadership disagreed with that characterization, saying that “the original provisions already allowed county parties to endorse candidates or withhold endorsements.” The GOP says wording “clarification” at the meeting “ensured that these mechanisms remained intact.”
People in attendance said the room became somber during the party’s financial report, as Dave Plond, the state party’s treasurer, stated, “We’ve got to turn this around…. The incomes just aren’t coming in.”

Earlier this year, an Examiner analysis of state and federal fundraising data showed that the Nebraska Democrats had out-raised the Nebraska GOP since 2022. 
Party officials said the GOP  is “actively exploring strategies to strengthen our financial position, including increased fundraising efforts and collaboration with county parties and supporters to ensure sustainable funding for our initiatives.” 
State Central Committee members also approved the resolution allowing the party to work with or help some “citizen-initiated petition drives and petition sponsors at the discretion of the State Party Chairman.”
Among those allowed: a measure that would ban abortion outright, with no exceptions and “EPIC Option 2.0,” which seeks to eliminate Nebraska taxes on property, income and inheritances. Rather than proposing a broad consumption tax as replacement revenue, it would leave the funding fix to the Legislature.
Also mentioned were a ballot initiative supporting shifting Nebraska to awarding presidential Electoral College votes based on the statewide winner of the presidential election’s popular vote, often called winner-take-all, and one requiring the hand-counting of ballots in elections. 
The GOP did not adopt a “code of conduct proposal,” participants said, because of a provision that prohibited secretly recording conversations among party members. The party’s executive committee passed the language as a standing rule, but it remains non-binding, attendees said. 
“Why remove key protections like the anti-recording provision without broader consultation?” an email to State Central Committee Members obtained by The Examiner said. “The answer seems clear: these amendments prioritize executive control over collaborative governance.”
Party leadership said the “code of conduct” was not voted down at the State Central Committee meeting, but that it was approved during an Executive Committee meeting last month. GOP leaders said the committee “did vote to table a Constitutional Amendment that outlined how the Code of Conduct would be enforced … unrelated to any specific provision about secret recordings.”

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.












State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media




In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Getty Images)Native American housing advocates are calling on Congress to help them meet growing and urgent affordable housing needs on tribal lands by reauthorizing a law that expired more than a decade ago.
Tribal housing leaders discussed what they say is an affordable housing crisis among their communities at a webinar Tuesday held by the Western Governors’ Association — a nonprofit organization of the governors of 22 states — and urged reauthorization of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, a law Congress first passed in 1996 that gave tribes more flexibility in how they could use federal housing funds to meet their communities’ needs. It eliminated a matrix of different housing programs and replaced them with a single, block grant program for projects.
Tribal radio stations wait on $9M pledged in congressional handshake deal

“This isn’t really a handout in any way, shape or form,” said Rudy Soto, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council and member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation. “Our ancestors of tribal nations, early as the country was forming, had the foresight to forge these treaties and legal agreements while conceding lands for the purposes of housing, education and health care.”
Native Americans have some of the lowest rates of homeownership in the country, and updating the law is the single most important way to boost home construction and homeownership among Native Americans, the housing leaders said.
“If people really want to help, they can help us reauthorize (the act) to improve the legislation and ensure this funding well into the future,” said Paul Lumley, a citizen of the Yakama Nation and chief advancement officer at the Native American Youth and Family Center in Portland.
The last time the act was reauthorized was in 2008, and it expired in 2013. While Congress still funds Native American housing assistance programs through other appropriations bills — even increasing funding for tribal housing needs in 2024 under the Biden administration — tribal leaders said the act itself needs to be reauthorized and updated to reduce red tape for housing projects.
Soto said his organization is working with Oregon’s U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, a Democrat representing the state’s 5th Congressional District, and Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, of Montana, to introduce legislation reauthorizing the law.
Neither congressional office immediately responded to requests for comment from the Oregon Capital Chronicle.
 Barriers to Native American homeownership goes beyond policy 

The Native American homeownership rate in the U.S. sits at 54% — less than the rate of 72% for white households and 63% for Asian households, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Native American homeownership rate is, however, higher than the rate of Black homeownership at 45%, and slightly more than the 51% Hispanic homeownership rate.
Advocates at the meeting pointed to a variety of barriers to owning homes, such as lower income levels and mortgage lending constraints on tribal land. Research also shows that Native American communities disproportionately experience overcrowded homes, and a lack of infrastructure and housing in remote areas where many Native Americans live on or near reservations.
Jody Cahoon Perez, executive director of the Salish and Kootenai Housing Authority based on the Flathead Reservation in Montana, said beyond policy, cultural and historical injustices play a role in the barriers Native Americans face when trying to own a home.
“Our whole way of life has changed, and we now live in homes that are stationary and we get mortgages on them when we never used to,” she said at the webinar. “We moved with the seasons, with the food we migrated. It was different. So it’s like we’re having to catch up with centuries of progress on the non-tribal side and also surviving genocide.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)As a new school year begins across North Dakota, students from Wahpeton to Williston, and from Bathgate to Bowman are back in our schools, making them hum with the excitement and promise of another year of learning. The return of students to school is more than a seasonal milestone. It is a reminder of the essential role our public schools and teachers play in sustaining our communities and securing our future.
In North Dakota, our schools are not just places where children learn math, reading, and science. They are often the cultural and social centers of our towns, especially in rural areas. Friday night football games, school concerts, and community gatherings all revolve around the local school. In many small towns, the school is the beating heart of the community, the one institution that ties generations together and keeps rural life vibrant.
At the center of this work are our teachers and education support professionals. North Dakota’s educators do more than instruct; they nurture, inspire, and guide. Whether in a small elementary school on the prairie or in a bustling high school in North Dakota’s more urban areas, teachers meet students where they are and help them reach their potential. These education professionals know their students by name, communicate with their families, and place our kids at the center of their best intentions. Most importantly, they educate every student who walks, runs, or rolls through their schoolhouse doors. That is the obligation and passion of every public school teacher.
Strong public schools are the key to North Dakota’s future. Our economy depends on a well- educated workforce ready to lead in fields like agriculture, energy, health care, education, public service, and technology. If we want our young people to stay in our state and build their lives here, we must provide them with schools that prepare them for success and communities that value their talents.
But strong schools don’t happen by accident.
They require stable funding, policies that recognize the unique needs of rural districts as well as urban districts, and fair salaries that keep great teachers in our classrooms. Given the importance and impact of public schools in North Dakota, when we shortchange our schools, we are shortchanging our communities and limiting opportunities for our children.
This school year, I encourage all North Dakotans to celebrate, support, and protect the public schools that hold our communities together. Let’s honor our teachers for the difference they make in the lives of students every single day. Because when we invest in our schools, we are not just funding education, we are building stronger communities, creating opportunities, and securing the future of North Dakota. Our kids deserve nothing less, and neither do we.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_1307EDIT-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-08-30 06:56:38.863413

(Courtesy of Danner campaign)OMAHA — Makayla Danner, a City of Omaha prosecutor for more than 20 years, has announced her bid to usher in “new energy” and “fresh perspective” as Douglas County attorney.
In seeking to win election as top prosecutor for Nebraska’s most populous county, Danner, a Democrat, underscored ties to the community and experience. 
As a city prosecutor since 2004, she said her cases have ranged from traffic violations to child neglect and assaults. She wants to hold town halls that promote transparency and better explain to the public how the justice system works.
“We don’t exist in isolation,” said Danner. “I’m going to be emphasizing cooperative partnerships. I want to be hands-on with prevention and intervention.”
Republican incumbent Don Kleine is seeking a sixth term. Democrat Amy Jacobsen, a Douglas County criminal prosecutor, previously announced her campaign for the 2026 election. The primary is in May of that year and the general election is in November.
Danner, also an adjunct professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, said she is a lifelong Omaha resident, wife and mother of five. 
“I know what works and what doesn’t,” she said. “My goal is to build a coalition that will bring a new, forward-thinking approach to the County Attorney’s Office.”
She said crime prevention efforts are the best way to lower prison populations and believes the county can improve in that area. Aiming at Kleine’s recent push for legislation that lowered the minimum age for detention to age 11, Danner said she saw no need to create a law for what she described as a few “exceptions to the rule.”
The Douglas County Attorney’s Office needs to be prepared, Danner said, for a “new brand of youth” and said her collaborative approach would help “get in front of issues, not behind.”
Her campaign, she said, would prioritize prosecution of violent offenses while expanding programs aimed at addressing root causes of crime, collaboration with law enforcement and community, expanding diversion programs for non-violent juvenile offenders and comprehensive ethics training for staff.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Brandon Beach, advancing from a seven-candidate jungle election to a runoff. Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderThe winds of change might be blowing through Georgia.
At least, that’s what Democrats are hoping for as both parties gear up for a competitive runoff election for an open state Senate seat. 
Georgia Democrats’ hopes were lifted when Democrat Debra Shigley easily secured the top spot in a seven-way race Tuesday and advanced to a runoff in a district that overwhelmingly reelected a Republican senator last year and helped send President Donald Trump back to the White House. 
 Debra Shigley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Shigley, who was the only Democrat in the first round of voting, is now preparing for a tougher challenge: a head-to-head race with a Republican. Her opponent will likely be Jason Dickerson, who held a narrow 65-vote edge for second place over fellow Republican Steve West as the votes were tabulated Tuesday night. West could still ask for a recount. 
Shigley, a Milton mom, attorney and small business owner, is running on a platform of improving affordability for families, strengthening public school systems and expanding access to health care. Dickerson, a Cherokee County resident, is the president of a private investment firm and has cast himself as a political outsider who plans to prioritize property tax relief and improving access to affordable housing for seniors. They were among the seven candidates who sought to replace Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach, who resigned from the Senate earlier this year after Trump appointed him to serve as the 46th U.S. Treasurer. 
The district, which includes parts of Fulton and Cherokee counties, is predominantly Republican, with Beach receiving upwards of 70% of the vote against a Democratic challenger in 2024. But Tuesday night’s turnout, in which Shigley garnered nearly 40% of the vote against Dickerson’s 17%, might be an early bellwether for Democratic enthusiasm in Georgia and across the country. In some precincts, Democratic support jumped by as much as 30 points.
Shigley, who said she is ramping up campaign efforts ahead of the runoff election, attributed her success to her willingness to stand up against Trump’s agenda, as well as growing frustration with the president’s policies.
 Five candidates for Georgia state Senate District 21 participated in a June candidate forum. From left, Lance Calvert, Stephanie Donegan, Brice Futch, Steve West and Brian Will. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.
“The fact that we were running against six very MAGA Republicans in the jungle part of this election, I think people were frustrated,” Shigley said. “They were frustrated with the status quo, and said as much, and were encouraged by the vision that I’m offering.”
The special election is what is known as a jungle primary, where instead of holding separate primaries for Democrats and Republicans, the candidates are all running against each other at once.
Dickerson’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. But in an online post Wednesday, Dickerson tried to rally Republicans behind his campaign. 
“There is much at stake over the next month – the woke left is mobilizing and will pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into our community to try to flip this seat,” Dickerson wrote in the post. “Now is the time to unite the conservative movement behind our campaign and send these liberals packing once and for all!” 
Democrats also saw successes in other elections nationwide. An Iowa special election held the same night resulted in Democrats flipping a seat in a historically red district, breaking the Republican supermajority in the Iowa state Senate.
Nate Rich, the Cherokee County Democratic Party chair, said Tuesday’s turnout signals a growing frustration with Republican policies at both the federal and state level.
“People are looking for a way to make a meaningful impact and make a difference, and so they’re showing up to knock on doors and write postcards and phone friends,” he said. “Anything they can do to get Debra across the finish line is kind of an act of protest with our national politics.”
He also credited the high Democratic turnout in the historically red county to Shigley’s strength as a candidate.
“When you spend some time with her, it’s hard not to have this infectious energy and optimism,” Rich said. “And so I think that that really puts gas in people’s tanks.”
GOP chairs in both Fulton and Cherokee counties did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon cautioned voters against reading too much into the outcome in comments he made on the night of the election.
“This is an election taking place in the dead of summer,” he said. “People are returning from summer vacation. People don’t know there’s an election. They’re not used to voting at this time of year.”
According to University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, Shigley will likely face an uphill battle in the runoff election, but added that the increase in turnout was a good sign for Democrats.
“The fact that the Democrat made it into the runoff, that’s probably significant,” Bullock said. “I suspect going into it, the expectation was it’ll be two Republicans, and it isn’t.”
Most likely, Bullock said, the Republican candidate will ultimately pull through as GOP voters consolidate around one candidate in the runoff election. But he said the competitive Republican race, which included attacks from Dickerson’s campaign aimed at former Commissioner Steve West, and a separate attack website aimed at Dickerson, could potentially dampen GOP turnout.
“What we’ve seen in past elections, if there has been a really bitter contest on the side of the majority party, that may make it difficult for the majority party to reunite as it moves to the next phase,” Bullock added. “This creates a situation in which the minority party can slip by and win a contest that, if you looked at it objectively beforehand, you’d say ‘we don’t have much of a shot here.’”
The top two candidates will face off for a second time on Sept. 23. One week of early voting will begin on Monday, Sept. 15, according to the secretary of state’s website.
