Credit Keith SchubertAdmonishing the Montana Legislature for being the “enabler” of a “pampered” and “dysfunctional” health department, Rep. John Fitzpatrick said Monday it’s time to break up the largest bureaucracy in the state.
The Republican from Anaconda said legislators have been forking over tens of millions of dollars to the Department of Public Health and Human Services and excusing it from accountability, and it’s time for a structural change.
“The problem with DPHHS is it’s too big, it’s inefficient, and the service quality declines,” Fitzpatrick said.
Fitzpatrick made his remarks in support of House Bill 851, which he said would transfer administration of state healthcare institutions and community-based programs to a new department of health services.
But his arguments didn’t fly with the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Safety Committee, which unanimously tabled his bill the same day.
The health department has experienced major and high-profile challenges, most notably the Montana State Hospital’s loss of federal funds and decertification by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2022.
However, during the hearing, members of the health community said the department is making progress, and a change would disrupt that trajectory.
Douglas Harrington, state medical officer, said in testimony regarding the confirmation of the health department director, Charlie Brereton, nearly 50 different groups expressed support not only for the director but for the path on which he has set the agency.
Additionally, Harrington said all seven health department facilities have stable leadership.
For the first time in years, nursing vacancies have been reduced by 30%, and the agency is recruiting roughly one new nurse a week, he said. Except for one-on-one visits, he said patient costs are down 25%.
“The bill is highly problematic for us at a time when significant momentum has been achieved,” Harrington said.
The health department annual plan for the current fiscal year — which ends June 30 — said the agency aims to implement 100% of required CMS recertification reforms at the state hospital in Warm Springs.
DPHHS did not respond to a question about whether the hospital will reach that goal this year.
Echoing the comments from many opponents of the bill, Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, said the idea to split the agency is so massive, it would need to be studied first.
Additionally, Glimm said, the state is starting to see positive results.
“Frankly, I think if you rip it in two right now, I think that starts to tear apart some of the effect of what we have going on there,” Glimm said.
Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, said he agreed.
Emrich said the bill wasn’t fully baked, essentially directing the governor to issue executive orders to finish it, and he moved to table it, which the committee supported on an 11-0 vote.
Even if legislators resurrect the bill, it may meet a hurdle in the Governor’s Office.
At a press conference last week, Gov. Greg Gianforte said he would not comment on the specific bill, but he said generally, his administration is opposed to bigger government.
He said splitting up an agency means two separate executive teams and potential silos that would make government less efficient.
“Those are principles that matter to our administration,” Gianforte said.
The House had supported the bill on an 82-15 vote, and Fitzpatrick was unrelenting in his criticism of the agency in committee. He said the state hospital is not in his district, but it’s close, and he gets frequent complaints about it.
Fitzpatrick also said the health department has spent profligately because it has failed to properly recruit, and legislators have been complicit in “shoveling the public’s money out like water going over the dam.”
“DPHHS has burned through $71 million to pay for traveling health care staff,” Fitzpatrick said. “That’s $97,000 a day.”
Most of the people who testified, though, said the bill would have negative consequences for the people the department is serving, although some said they appreciated the sponsor’s hunt for efficiencies and his care for Montanans.
Kali Wicks, with national mental health advocacy organization Inseparable, thanked Fitzpatrick for his interest in the topic, but said the bill had the potential to stop progress “in its tracks” and “create some issues with continuity of care.”
Wicks agreed it might be time for a study bill if time allowed.
Mike Chavers, representing the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch and the Behavioral Health Alliance of Montana, said change is hard, and progress in public systems can feel “painfully slow,” but HB 851 would derail momentum.
“We must oppose this bill, not because we’re resistant to reform, but because we started to see the fruits of our hard work,” Chavers said.
The agency’s chief legal counsel, Paula Stannard, said the bill could raise a “significant legal issue” depending on the way Montana broke up the department.
Stannard said federal rules require a single state agency to administer the state Medicaid plan, and a split could risk federal funds if it created separate points of contact.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_1879-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-04-15 14:10:38.631535

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As some Mainers finalized their taxes on Tuesday, roughly 75 used the filing deadline to protest what they view as state and federal tax structures that favor the rich — and more broadly, the Trump administration’s cuts to programs relied on by average Mainers that they see as footing the bill. 
As Auburn resident Nelson Beaudoin told Maine Morning Star, there are a hundred reasons that drew him to the rally, “and they all start with the letter T.” 
Advocates for tax reform under the coalition Mainers for Tax Fairness gathered at the State House in Augusta to voice their objections to Congress advancing a budget plan that lays the groundwork for extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. 
“We are here to connect the dots,” said Ryan Tipping, director of campaigns and strategy for the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy. “We need to listen to what the cost of that greed is.”
Tipping and other speakers pointed to a litany of cuts that have impacted Maine, including the Trump administration firing the entire staff of the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, which tens of thousands of Mainers rely on, and layoff notices issued to 13 employees of the Maine State Library last week, which also led to a temporary closure. 
They also cautioned about possible implications should the congressional budget plan pass, such as cuts to low-income food assistance and Medicaid, as many say the tax cuts in the plan will not be possible without slashing the program. 
“Is my life worth less than tax breaks for billionaires?” asked Gina Morin, a Mainer who relies on Medicaid for prescriptions to treat a chronic disease. 
Formed in 2020 and launched in 2021, the Mainers for Tax Fairness coalition comprises a number of organizations representing progressive interests across the state, such as Maine Equal Justice, Maine People’s Alliance and the Maine Center for Economic Policy, who are also backing bills being considered by the Maine Legislature to restructure the state’s tax brackets.
“If the rich paid more taxes, they would still be rich,” Sharon Beaudoin, a retired educator from Auburn who attended the rally, told Maine Morning Star.

Last week, the Taxation Committee tabled a number of the tax reform bills that the group supports to wait until a nonpartisan state committee releases its updated state revenue projections next month. The state is currently looking at a projected deficit of $450 million over the next two years. 
In order to fill the gap, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has proposed some program cuts and a number of largely regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on low earners, but the coalition is alternatively pushing for a model that taxes the wealthy more.
Among those bills is LD 1089, sponsored by Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell), which would impose an income tax surcharge of 4% on taxable income in excess of $1 million, with the revenue generated going to fund public K-12 education. 
That $1 million level triggers the 4% surcharge for all tax filing statuses, which is not typical for tax structures in Maine. Therefore, the committee is considering an amendment, which in addition to some technical tweaks would add another level before the 4% surcharge would be triggered. 
Another bill, LD 229 sponsored by Rep. Ann Matlack (D-Spruce Head), would add new tax brackets and increase the threshold for the state’s lower tax brackets.
Other bills that the tax rally attendees highlighted include a plan to impose an additional tax of 4% on investment income above certain thresholds and another to increase the real estate transfer tax for sales over $1 million.
The coalition also supports legislation that aims to support the average Mainer in other ways, including by expanding the state’s version of a child tax credit and increasing funding for family planning services, such routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, but not abortions. 
Anna Kellar, executive director of Maine Citizens for Clean Elections, discussed bills that, in light of the budget outlook, lawmakers seem poised to reject that aim to expand the state’s clean elections program, which finances campaigns through public funding.
“Unfortunately, when we’re in tight budget years like this, funding for clean elections gets pitted against funding for all of the other things that we care about — rental assistance, Medicaid, our schools,” Kellar said. “But we refuse to accept this idea of scarcity.”
Instead, Kellar said the solution is clear: “making the wealthy pay their fair share.” 
The rally on Tax Day was also the first stop for the inflatable “tax the ultra rich” yacht tour, said Lewiston-Auburn resident Rebecca Swanson Conrad, who represents Oxfam “Sisters on the Planet,”  a group working to end global economic injustice. 
“I simply do not believe that a billionaire’s yacht should come at the expense of everyday Americans,” Swanson Conrad said, to which members of the crowd responded, “damn right.”
However, she added that the work ahead is not convincing those in attendance today but rather, she said, “those who cannot see how it impacts them, yet.”
Swanson Conrad urged people to share the stories told today with neighbors and call on them to press their elected officials to push back on tax cuts for the wealthy, before the group walked to the federal offices of Maine’s U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Angus King, an independent, to begin those calls.

Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young, himself a former Democratic state lawmaker, has held the office since 2019. All four of Colorado’s executive-branch posts — governor, attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer — are currently held by Democrats who are term-limited and will be up for grabs in 2026.
Other candidates who are running in the Democratic primary for treasurer include Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone; Jerry DiTullio, the Jefferson County treasurer; and John Mikos. No Republicans so far have filed candidacy paperwork with the state.
Bridges touted his sponsorship of a successful bill to provide full-day kindergarten to Colorado children, his pandemic-era bills for small business relief, and his support for the state’s comprehensive paid sick leave policy. 
Bridges is endorsed by former Ambassador Ken Salazar, state Senate President James Coleman, and former state Senate President Steve Fenberg, among other Colorado Democrats, according to a press release.

(Courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says.
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis.
That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring.
But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said.
Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.

Mike Braun on Tuesday to kick off a “Make Indiana Healthy Again” initiative featuring nine freshly inked executive orders.

He spoke atop a dais before dozens of dignitaries and others packed into in an ornate, wood-paneled room at the Indiana State Library. Just outside a pair of large wooden doors, protesters waved signs and chanted, their calls audible.
“This isn’t a usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda. We’re focused on root causes, transparent information and real results,” Braun added.
His orders deal with government food and health assistance, food additives, student fitness and more — and make Indiana the latest state to promote Trump’s push to “Make America Healthy Again.”
One order would impose work requirements on Hoosiers who receive assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and another “removes candy and soft drinks from SNAP benefits so that taxpayer funds are helping low income Americans afford nutritious food, not junk.”
Oz dubbed Tuesday “a monumental day, not just in Indiana, but for this great nation,” noting Indiana’s nine orders exceed actions by other states.
“It turns out that about the most patriotic thing you can do these days is to get healthy,” Oz added later.

For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.

Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.

‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.

Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

To Brent, he thinks there is currently one big issue farmers across Pennsylvania are thinking about.
“I think tariffs definitely are on people’s mind,” Brent Copenhaver said to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star. “How that will impact us locally is still, I think, yet to be determined.”
The Copenhavers hosted several high-ranking government officials on Monday morning, including U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. She was joined by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson – Chair of the House Agriculture Committee –and U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-9th District.
They made the case the tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration will prove beneficial to farmers.
Rollins, during the first of three stops in central Pennsylvania, said Trump’s tariffs on foreign products was a move to “save America.”

Since Trump made his tariff announcement on April 2, the stock market has experienced volatility, leading to concerns from economists about a potential recession.
Rollins said the effort was to create better trade deals with countries, who she claimed have been taking advantage of America for decades.
“That realignment is disruptive. It’s transformative, but is disruptive,” Rollins said. “And so we’re watching the market adjust to that right now. We believe it will be a short-term adjustment.”
McCormick, who supports Trump’s tariff policy, said there has been “uncertainty” with the markets as of late, but he believes that the economy will benefit as new trade deals are ironed out.
During Trump’s first term, some $25 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was used to give direct payments to farmers impacted by trade disputes with China. Rollins said the administration is prepared to provide relief to farmers “if there is damaging consequences to these (trade) negotiations.”
“The hope and the goal is that it won’t be necessary,” Rollins said, but added the administration was prepared to help out farmers, if needed.
Thompson echoed Rollins, saying he was “fully supportive of Trump” on the issue of trade and that he doesn’t expect it will be needed for farmers, but is prepared to support those payments, if needed.
Thompson referenced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and China Phase One deal, during Trump’s administration as proof he trusts the president on resolving the ongoing tariff situation.
Rollins says ‘money is there for food banks’
In March, the USDA notified Pennsylvania and other states across the country that it was canceling programs to provide $1 billion of federal funding to schools and food banks to allow them to purchase food from farms, according to Politico.
Following the move, Gov. Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Agriculture Sec. Russell Redding held a press conference on March 25 announcing they were pushing back on the USDA action to cancel $13 million over the next three years in funding for Pennsylvania farmers. Redding said he sent a letter to the federal agency to appeal the decision and Shapiro said if it fails, he would consider further legal action.
Rollins said she respects Shapiro, but added he or other leaders in Pennsylvania, “don’t have their facts right, or they’re playing games.”
“They’re trying to make this a political issue,” Rollins said to reporters at Martin’s Family Farm in Myerstown, Lebanon County. “The money is there.”
Rollins argued since becoming the head of the USDA, they’ve “released almost one billion dollars to food banks” and said there is money sitting in state accounts from the USDA to support food banks.
Thompson says no cuts will be made to SNAP
A budget plan from House Republicans would cut $230 billion from the Department of Agriculture, according to Reuters, and Democrats are concerned the cuts would come from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. It “provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget.
Thompson called it a “mistruth” and said that he is “not going to stand for any cuts” to the program.
“These are our neighbors that are living in difficult financial times,” Thompson said. He added that changes can be made to make the program more effective.
During a Q&A with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star in March, Thompson said there would be no reductions to SNAP in the next Farm Bill and would like to expand access to “two vulnerable populations who have never been eligible” for SNAP before: Those previously incarcerated for felony drug charges when they return from prison and “adult children of families that are living in financially challenging circumstances,” who “tend to be children with disabilities.”
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cited potential cuts to SNAP as reasons he’s opposed recent GOP budget plans.

‘Labor is a massive concern,’ Rollins says
As the Trump administration follows through on its promise of deportations, the president suggested at a cabinet meeting Thursday that farmers could petition to keep workers without legal status, Reuters reported. Rollins recognized the concern the administration has over the agriculture workforce on Monday.
“Labor continues to be a massive concern for our agriculture community,” Rollins said.
The secretary said she and U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer have been tasked with working with legislative partners to come up with solutions to the issue.
Thompson said in the previous session of Congress, he put together a bipartisan work group to address the challenges facing the agriculture workforce and “in the not too distant future” they will put together a “discussion draft” to get input on potential remedies.
“We need to do this in a tri-partisan way,” Thompson said, making the case that Democrats, Republicans, and the agriculture industry can work together on the matter.
In the past, Thompson said the H2-A visa program, which helps American farmers fill temporary employment gaps by hiring workers from other countries, needs to be reformed, including making it “year round.”

How’s the Farm Bill?
Thompson said the Farm Bill, which is passed roughly every five years, is “coming along nicely.”
In 2024, Congress approved a one-year extension of the bill, as the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are on the clock to pass the next version of the legislation.
Will it pass this year?
“You bet,” Thompson said. “It absolutely should. The sooner in the year is the better, obviously.”
Thompson previously told the Capital-Star his goal was to “get this done in the first six months and as early as possible.”
With elected leaders and Secretary Rollins on hand, Brent Copenhaver said he was “honored” to host them and “promote the dairy industry.” He described updating the Farm Bill as important to local farmers as well and specifically wanting to see updated language for dairy margin coverage.
“Those numbers are based off your production history, and those numbers are outdated,” he said. “We have improved on how we have handled our cows. We have improved our milk production, and I think they need to go back and revisit and look at that production history and allow us to increase that production history to be on a more average of what we are doing today.”
“We just need to update some of the things. It’s already in the bill. We just need it updated,” Copenhaver added. “And it’s a great program that the USDA does offer.”

The debate over House Bill 1163 has been one of the most contentious this legislative session. 
Conservatives and gun owners think it puts an unconstitutional barrier to the right to bear arms. 
Democrats see it as one more step the state can take to reduce gun violence, after banning bump stocks and prohibiting sales of high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic firearms.
“As the son and grandson and nephew and cousin of responsible gun owners, I know that the Second Amendment is critical to our freedom that’s cherished by Washingtonians around the state,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in floor debate Monday, “but I know that gun owners across Washington are united in their desire to make sure that only those who are legally authorized to have firearms should have access to them.” 
The bill moves beyond the state’s existing background check system. 
It would require gun buyers to apply for a five-year permit from the Washington State Patrol. To qualify, applicants must have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with some exceptions, and pay a fee.
If the applicant has completed the safety course, the state would have to approve the permit unless the person is barred from having guns, out of custody on bond awaiting trial or sentencing on felony charges, or the subject of an arrest warrant. 
Troopers would issue the permit within 30 days, or 60 days if the applicant doesn’t have a state ID. State patrol anticipates receiving at least 100,000 applications per year, with over 40 employees tasked with handling them.
The agency expects the new program will cost nearly $20 million in the 2027-29 budget cycle. Fees collected for fingerprinting and background checks would offset the cost, according to a fiscal analysis. The system could bring in $31 million in the 2027-29 budget.
Democrats in the Senate passed the legislation on a party-line 29-19 vote. 
Amendments made in the Senate include exemptions from the training requirement for licensed armed security guards and private investigators. Lawmakers also delayed the effective date from November 2026 to May 2027.
On Monday, Democratic senators shot down Republican amendments to exempt some groups from the permit requirement, among other things.
The bill, which has the support of state Attorney General Nick Brown, now returns to the House for lawmakers there to consider the changes before sending it to the governor. 
The policy has never come this close to becoming law. Last year, it didn’t even advance out of committee.
About a dozen states have implemented permit-to-purchase programs, and such laws have withstood legal challenges.
Still, Republicans in the Legislature believe courts would strike down the Washington proposal. Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, called the bill “hostile to the Second Amendment.”
“This is simply a poorly designed assault on hard-working taxpayers who want to legally exercise their hunting rights, their Second Amendment rights,” said Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville.
Most other Democratic priorities on guns have fizzled out this year in Olympia, including proposals to limit bulk purchases of firearms and ammunition, require gun owners to lock up their weapons in their cars and homes and add new requirements for gun dealers.
But a bill expanding the list of places where it’s illegal to carry a gun has cleared the Senate and now awaits a vote in the House.

(Screengrab from NCGA video stream)As the North Carolina Senate fast tracks a newly released two-year budget proposal through the chamber this week, members of the state’s Progressive House Caucus held a press conference Tuesday to call out what they say is the lack of public input and accountability in the budgeting process.
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said the Senate budget that earmarks $32.6 billion in 2025-26 and $33.3 billion the year after was crafted with no collaboration from Democrats or real public input.
“[Billion of dollars] are rolled into a last-minute conference report, dumped on our desk, and shoved through with an up or down vote. That is not just a procedural complaint. It’s a democratic crisis,” said Butler at a Tuesday legislative press conference.
Butler is advocating for two bills she sponsored earlier in the session to improve the budget process.
House Bill 178, the “Budgeting Accountability and Transparency Act,” would require that any conference committee report (the document that spells out the final version of a bill that has been agreed to by House and Senate leaders) on the budget be publicly available for at least 72 hours before a vote can occur. It would give lawmakers, stakeholders and the public time to read the hundreds of pages that make up the budget bill.
House Bill 180, “Fiscally Responsible & Sustainable Budgeting,” would require a multi-year look back and look forward based on performance rather than relying on one-time money. HB 180 also requires that any tax cut or spending increase over a certain threshold include an offset so future legislatures are not saddled with obligations the state cannot afford.
“These bills do not favor Democrats or Republicans. They favor the people of North Carolina who deserve to see how their money is being spent,” said Butler.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said legislative leaders would also be wise to embrace House Bill 303 (“Make Corporations Pay What They Owe”) that would halt the ongoing gradual repeal of the corporate income tax.
“We don’t need to cut the corporate income tax to zero by 2030. This state will lose $2 billion that can be used for our priorities of helping people, helping school children, the necessities we need to make the state stronger,” Morey urged. “It must be reinstated so this state can be fiscally responsible.”
Alexandra Sirota of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center cautioned that North Carolina is experiencing the ripple effects of federal funding chaos, program freezes, and a looming congressional budget that threatens to push even more costs onto the states.
“Unless our legislative leaders change course, we know that North Carolina’s future budget picture will get worse, not better. We cannot afford to trust empty promises,” Sirota warned.
 State workers, Helene survivors, faith leaders call for public investments 
Charles Owens, a healthcare technician at Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro, said that with rising housing costs and living expenses, state workers deserve better than the meager increases being put forth in the budget proposal unveiled by Senate leaders Monday night.
“The workers at Cherry Hospital, along with all the other DHHS facilities, work with the most vulnerable, exploited, and sometimes the most dangerous people in North Carolina, meaning the mentally ill, the abused, and sometimes criminals shipped to us from the prisons,” Owens explained. “We take care of them with some of the best treatment this state can offer. But yet, as public workers, we aren’t being taken care of by our lawmakers.”
Most state workers would see a 1.25% raise next year, as well as a $3,000 bonus over the next two years in the Senate proposal.
Owens said that as budget writers advance another round of corporate tax cuts, state employees are being told to expect to pay higher costs for participating in the State Health Plan next year.
“Imagine public workers that provide health care, being told that the state can afford tax cuts, but they can’t afford to continue making investments in our health.”
  Sam Stites, Just Economics (Courtesy photo)
Sam Stites, the living wage program coordinator with the group Just Economics, traveled to Raleigh from Transylvania County on Tuesday to urge lawmakers to craft a better budget.
Stites said for western North Carolina it’s been a year of rude awakenings since Helene, with relief dollars slow to materialize for many working-class individuals.
“Wealthy individuals and corporations should not be getting tax cuts when working western North Carolinians are being evicted and small businesses are shuttering. That is why I came here.”
Stites said in addition to rebuilding infrastructure, lawmakers need to help the hundreds of Helene survivors who are facing eviction.
“I’m talking about the $10 million you were asked for in rental assistance and said ‘no’ to, and the small business grants that you were asked for and aid ‘No’ to,” said Stites. “To me it is simple, if you do not have enough money for working people and small businesses, then you do not have enough money for tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations.”
  Abby Lublin, Carolina Jews for Justice (Courtesy photo)
Abby Lublin, executive director of Carolina Jews for Justice, said the state budget is truly a statement about North Carolina’s values.
“Cutting the corporate income tax does not fill a child’s stomach. It doesn’t raise teacher pay. It doesn’t heal our rural hospitals or fix our crumbling roads.”
Lublin said simply pausing the corporate tax rate at its current level would provide revenue for services that are desperately needed at a time of sweeping federal cuts.
“To the lawmakers who are enacting a budget process without transparency, I’m looking right at you,” said Lublin. “A budget that pits people and communities against each other to fight for crumbs is only due to a lack of moral courage.”

Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, introduces the budget on third reading before the Senate on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The state’s two-year budget cleared a hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, securing bipartisan support to move forward through the legislative process. 
The portion of the budget under House Bill 1001 dedicated to funding the state’s share of Medicaid expenses continues to grow, increasing from from 15% in 2021 to 18% in 2023 and 22% in this year’s budget. 
“For the last couple of years, I’ve been very concerned about Medicaid,” said Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “I hope you’re all starting to see that as well.”
Mishler helms budget-writing in the Senate.
Aside from Medicaid and K-12 education, two state agencies absorbed nearly all of the increased spending: the Department of Child Services and the Department of Correction. The former overspent its last appropriation while the latter ran out of dollars to pay the per diem for local jails to house low-level felony offenders. 
The Republican-led budget won the vote of Sen. David Niezgodski, a Democrat from South Bend. He pointed to funding for commuter rail in his district along with “settling the lease with the (Indiana) Historical Society,” an agreement that was in doubt following some language appearing to contradict Republican intentions. 
Republicans reject cascade of Democratic amendments to budget

Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, also broke his streak of opposing the budget to support House Bill 1001 on Tuesday. The sole Republican to vote against the measure, Indianapolis Sen. Mike Young, didn’t explain his vote. 
But not everyone was on board, despite the bipartisan support. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura criticized the lack of funds dedicated to shrinking the state’s outstanding waitlists for Medicaid waiver services as well as inadequate funding for curricular materials for local school corporations.
“The question is not whether or not Indiana has the resources — it is the question about the priorities. Sen. Mishler and my colleagues are correct: Medicaid is growing and public education is growing,” said Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “Doesn’t it concern you that two million out of 6.9 million have to rely on some form of health care provided by the government? What does that tell you about the status … the futures across the state?”
One Republican also shared her concerns about the budget moving forward.
Sen. Vaneta Becker said that while she would support the proposal on Tuesday, she “likely wouldn’t” when it returned for a final vote. She cited public education funding concerns as well as the decision to strike funding for the Women’s Commission and the Indiana Commission on the Social Status of Black Males. 
“I’m very disappointed in the loss of those but the biggest thing I’m sorry about is the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. It’s such a small amount when you’re looking at a $44 billion budget. It was $2 million in the first year,” said Becker, R-Evansville. “… if you’re concerned about early childhood literacy, you can’t do better than that.”
She said she hoped First Lady Maureen Braun would be able to independently raise funds for the program, as she previously said she would do.
The proposal will go to a conference committee, which allows the two chambers to negotiate final language that reflects updated data due to be released during a Wednesday revenue forecast.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Legislation that could land animal abusers in prison for as long as ten years passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee late Monday after it appeared to die last week without a vote before the Legislature’s first deadline. 
“Amendments come and go and change at rapid speed as we approach the deadline,” the committee’s chairperson, Assemblywoman Brittany Miller said during Monday’s work session, indicating her internal polling of committee members last week, as amendments were crafted in the final hours, did not bode well for the measure. “At no time was there anyone who doesn’t want to address the heinous crimes and acts of animal cruelty.”
Miller said lawmakers “don’t always have time to process” amendments, adding the committee was able to obtain a waiver allowing the Assembly Judiciary to vote Assembly Bill 381 out of committee. The bill, Reba’s Law, was “able to be resurrected,” Miller said, resulting in a “much more intense, robust bill than we had before.” 
The measure is named for Reba, a bulldog who died of heat stroke days after she was found in a sealed tote behind a business last summer. 
An amendment from the Nevada District Attorneys Association eliminated provisions that would have allowed for the prosecution of individuals who allow the abuse of an animal. 
The amendment also removes language requiring permission from the animal’s owner or a veterinarian to euthanize an animal. It instead requires a peace officer to forfeit the animal to a local government if the owner does not request a hearing within a certain time frame, or cannot be found within five business days. The local government must then decide whether to euthanize the animal or transfer ownership to a rescue organization, shelter or individual. 
Causing the death of an animal would be deemed a category B felony, and could land offenders in prison for one to ten years and a fine of not more than $10,000. 
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson complained last year he needed stiffer penalties to impose against animal abusers than those allowed by law. However, a review of cases prosecuted by Wolfson indicates he rarely seeks prison time, even in egregious cases. 
Lynn Whatford, a Clark County resident who cared for community cats in her neighborhood, spent much of the last year seeking justice for a colony of two dozen cats she says disappeared one by one. She suspects her neighbor killed them.
Nevada Voters for Animals founder Gina Greisen told lawmakers that Wolfson declined to prosecute the case after Whatford discovered a trapped cat left in her neighbor’s yard without protection from the sun and a high temperature of 114 degrees on July 25, the day the cat likely died. A veterinarian’s post mortem examination noted “it is clear (the cat) experienced extreme physical suffering in an inescapable situation, and that heat stroke is the likely cause of death in this case.” 
Whatford complained to Clark County Animal Control for months that the cats were disappearing and that she heard cries coming from her neighbor’s yard. 
“Animal Control told me I needed proof, yet the officer couldn’t access my neighbor’s property to get the proof. Animal Control referred me to Metro, but the detective wouldn’t do anything until I had proof,” Whatford said during an interview in September.
Greisen testified in support of the measure, but warned that without proper training and resources for police and animal control officers, stricter penalties will do little to help stem abuse and neglect. 
Las Vegas justice activist Leslie Turner testified in opposition and said the measure is “just another way to funnel more people into the criminal legal system,” and does nothing to address the causes of cruelty, including “mental health struggles, childhood trauma, cycles of violence, economic instability.” 
A one to ten year sentence, she noted, exceeds the one to six year sentence for child abuse. “How can we justify punishing someone more harshly for harming an animal than for harming a child? What does this say about our priorities?” she asked in written testimony, adding lawmakers should instead invest in “education, early intervention, and community-based mental health resources.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BrittneyMiller-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-15 13:21:04.334779

Munson, 39, of Oklahoma City, was first elected to the Oklahoma House in 2015 as the first Asian-American woman in the state Legislature. She said she will continue to serve in her role as House Minority Leader until her term ends in 2026. 
“I’m going to spend the next year-and-a-half traveling our beautiful state, listening to people and asking them what’s important to them,” she said. “I want to know what they love about Oklahoma and what they think we can do better, because that is what this campaign is about, the people of our great state, and that is what I will carry with me as your next governor.”
She filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Monday.
Munson is the only Democrat to announce a bid for governor during the 2026 election cycle thus far, but already faces opposition from a crowded Republican field that includes Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, former House Speaker Charles McCall, former state Sen. Mike Mazzei, and Leisa Mitchell Haynes of Choctaw. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, cannot run again due to term limits.
She said she was the first Democrat to flip her seat from Republican, and plans to use the same strategy of listening to Oklahomans regardless of their political affiliation in her campaign for governor.
“I know I’m not what you would call a typical candidate for governor. I work for a living, I pay my student loans, I rent my house, and I know what it is like to live within a budget,” she said. “I feel the pressure of rising costs of our daily necessities. I don’t come from a wealthy family. I’m not beholden to any political party. I’m not an extremist. I have a proven track record of working across the aisle to get things done and won’t pander to Washington D.C. politicians who only want to continue deepening our political divide. And as your next governor, I will fight for the things that will help everyday Oklahomans.”

There was a time George Finley Jr. was on the honor roll.
After the seventh grader started having epileptic seizures a couple of years ago, he experienced memory loss. Now, he’s far behind where he should be academically. The Detroit Public Schools Community District agreed in November to pay for outside tutoring to help him catch up, records show.
That still hasn’t happened, and the school year is near its end.
“My son is not progressing,” said his mother, Sheri King.
She was close to getting an answer from the district. But the Trump administration gutted the U.S. Department of Education’s workforce weeks later, and the civil rights attorney who was helping facilitate King’s communication with George’s school stopped responding to her emails. His position, along with hundreds of others, was eliminated. With new leadership, the department shuttered more than half of its regional civil rights enforcement offices, which had investigated and resolved complaints for decades. Now, remaining offices must take on the backlog of cases.
King is in the same position as many families in Michigan and across the country. Parents of students with disabilities and those who experience racial discrimination or sexual violence in schools are uncertain of the fate of their federal complaints. Many say they have not gotten updates on their cases since the regional offices closed. Some, like King, fear what the future will look like for their children.
Hundreds of federal civil rights cases were put on hold after President Donald Trump took office in January. On Feb. 20, Craig Trainor, now the deputy assistant secretary for policy in the Office for Civil Rights, ended the pause on cases that solely dealt with disability discrimination. Staff were still told not to pursue race- and sex-based discrimination cases. At the same time, under new guidance, targeted investigations of school programs that promote diversity and policies that support transgender students were initiated.
Education Secretary Linda McMahon lifted the freeze on all cases on March 6. However, the department laid off the staff of seven of its 12 civil rights enforcement offices on March 12. The closures included the Cleveland office, which handled cases for Michigan and Ohio.
Advocates said the move effectively decimated the department’s workforce and sabotaged its ability to enforce civil rights protections for students.
Former attorneys at the Department of Education said the nearly 50% reduction in staff will undoubtedly add to an existing backlog of cases.
“The reality is, cases aren’t moving, period,” one former Cleveland office staff attorney told Chalkbeat on the condition of anonymity due to fears of retribution.
The gutting of the department added to an existing backlog of thousands of open complaints. In Michigan alone, there are currently 782 civil rights cases under investigation, according to the department’s list of records published online. Of those, 462 are disability discrimination cases. Those investigations were opened before the dramatic changes to the department.
Michigan special education advocates said many of the parents they work with have not heard updates on their cases. Some had pending mediation hearing dates with their districts scheduled that have since passed.
Jacquelyn Binford, whose son, Rocco, is in first grade in Chippewa Valley Schools, was scheduled to have a mediation hearing on March 19 for a complaint she filed in December 2023. She hoped the district would agree to provide more occupational therapy to help her son develop his motor skills.
The district’s representative never responded to confirm the hearing date.
Since then, all of Michigan’s cases were assigned to the federal department’s Denver office. Binford said she hasn’t gotten any updates about the case.
“Here we are now,” Binford said. “This could have already been resolved.”
Chippewa Valley Schools did not respond to a request for comment on Binford’s case.
Detroit Public Schools Community District officials said they “respect the challenges that all parents with students” with individualized education programs, or IEPs, have.
The district said it will continue to “problem solve through the challenges they are facing to ensure their children succeed in school with the limited resources the District receives to educate each child with an IEP.”
 Critical services, safety at stake for children, workers say

The Office for Civil Rights is charged with investigating and enforcing federal protections for students in K-12 schools, as well colleges and universities. It also facilitates mediations to come to voluntary agreements between parties.
The department is mandated to promptly investigate and resolve complaints against local and state education agencies as an impartial third party.
The federal laws it seeks compliance with include Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which ensures students with disabilities have a right to equal access to educational opportunities and services.
Quickly resolving complaints is crucial to the safety and educational outcomes of many children, former federal workers say.
“There could be a kid staying at home because they’re the survivor of sexual assault and there are no measures in place to ensure their safety,” the former Cleveland staff member said. “Or there could be a student with a behavior plan that’s not being implemented and that student is being restrained.”
Before his departure, the attorney said there was a case close to mediation that involved a high school student in a juvenile detention facility. The complaint alleged the facility did not have the special education services that would allow the child to graduate.
“I did feel like there could be a pathway to see this kid graduate,” the attorney said. “We had to cancel mediation because we were told not to do any communication with schools.”
Because the department missed the opportunity to intervene before the end of the school year, the attorney said the window to help the student graduate is gone.
A large part of the work of attorneys at the Cleveland office fell outside of investigations and mediations to reach early resolutions, another former staff member told Chalkbeat.
In King’s case, a mediation agreement was already made. But, the mother told the attorney who was assigned to her original complaint that the district was not complying with the tutoring portion of the agreement.
The attorney was in the process of finding the point of contact in the district to finalize George’s enrollment and payment for the tutoring program before the Cleveland office was shuttered.
Binford said while she waits for an answer from Chippewa Valley Schools about whether they will provide in-school occupational therapy for Rocco, he struggles to keep up with his peers in gym class. He still needs help developing his muscles to open and close zippers, write, and cut food.
Michigan families are also awaiting the outcome of an Office for Civil Rights investigation that found the Michigan Department of Education allegedly violated the rights of students with disabilities during COVID-era school closures.
The state agency was accused of repeatedly giving incorrect information about students’ rights to parents and schools, according to legal filings. The federal investigation also alleged the state agency knew districts were failing to provide services to students with disabilities.
The federal investigation alleged students at the Michigan School for the Deaf, which is operated by the Michigan education agency, had their instructional time reduced by 43% during the 2020-21 school year. Students didn’t get speech language pathology, social work, or visual impairment consultation services for long periods of time, according to the federal agency.
The complaint seeks compensatory services for all students with disabilities in the state who were denied adequate educational support during that time.
Attorneys for the agency asked multiple times for the case to be thrown out. The Office for Civil Rights accused the state agency of attempting to shield itself from scrutiny and said in case filings it had not provided any proof that its alleged violations have been remedied.
Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate who filed the initial complaint against the state agency, said the administrative law judge assigned to the case was not impacted by the cuts to the Department of Education. She said a final hearing date for the administrative judge to issue a ruling has not yet been set.
“We’re still waiting every day to see what happens,” said Lipsitt.
The Michigan Department of Education has denied any wrongdoing.
 Caseloads have doubled since federal cuts, former staff say

The federal Department of Education handles thousands of cases each year. In 2024, it received nearly 23,000 complaints.
Now that 240 staff members at the Office for Civil Rights have been laid off, those who remain are saddled with more than double their usual caseloads, according to former Cleveland attorneys.
Staff working at the regional offices that are still open also will have to learn the idiosyncrasies of state-specific laws. The attorneys who were laid off took with them decades of institutional knowledge, according to former staff.
A federal lawsuit filed on March 13 against the Education Department, Trainor, and McMahon, alleges the agency’s “complaint and investigation processing functions have fallen under attack.”
Two parents and the nonprofit association Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, including two Michigan members, are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs allege the department “has abdicated its responsibility to enforce civil rights protections, leaving students who should be able to trust and rely on their government to protect and defend their rights to instead endure discriminatory and unsafe learning environments without recourse.”
The Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.
 Michigan families say they have run out of options

Many families feel they have run out of options after years of fighting for their children to receive appropriate education and support.
Lyn Hollister, mother of twins in ninth grade in Tri County Area Schools, filed federal complaints in February and still hasn’t heard anything about their statuses.
Shelbie, Hollister’s daughter who has autism and mild cognitive impairment, is still waiting for the district to modify her curriculum to focus on life and job skills. As she waits, Shelbie is suffering from mental health issues because of the stress to meet grade level standards.
Last week, the district agreed to put Hollister’s other daughter, Makenzie, who has cognitive impairment and severe cerebral palsy, on a track to receive a high school completion certificate instead of a diploma. The change will allow Makenzie to get more thorough transition services after high school, her mother said.
Hollister requested the same for Shelbie but is still fighting for the change.
“When your child comes home on certain days they have struggled and wrap their arms around you crying because they are so overwhelmed that day because of what is put on them, you just break down,” she said. “And your hands are tied.”
A representative for Tri County Area Schools declined to comment on Hollister’s case.
Hollister said she plans on moving her daughters to another school in the fall. They qualify for a Section 105c waiver, which will allow them to attend a school outside of their district.
“We’re hoping in this new district, they can finally have a team to support our children to be the best that they can be,” she said.
King, the Detroit mother, said if she could afford to, she would move to another part of the state in hopes of finding a district that might provide a better outcome for George.
Options like private school wouldn’t work for Rocco, said Binford.
“I worry he would be forgotten about,” she said. “They don’t have the resources or the training to support him in a private school. We really do rely on the public education system.”
In some cases, complaints filed with the federal department can be handled by state or local agencies. That depends on what protections states have covered in their own civil rights laws.
In Michigan, the state education agency’s Office of Special Education enforces compliance with parts of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and state law. The office investigates and mediates state-level complaints. Complaints can also be filed with local intermediate school districts.
The Michigan Department of Civil Rights enforces the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which includes protections from discrimination based on gender, sexuality, religion, race. It also enforces the state’s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act.
Binford said since she hasn’t heard anything back from the federal office, she was advised by an advocate to make a mediation appointment with Macomb Intermediate School District.
Another avenue for parents are lawsuits. However, legal cases are costly and timely. The standard of proof in the court system is also higher than in administrative proceedings.
King said after years of fighting for her son, she is left with limited choices.
“I feel hopeless,” she said. “I don’t know where to go from here.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — Saying that fossil fuels’ role in causing climate change is “subject to debate,” Republican Senate President Robert Stivers touted President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry as a “step in the right direction” toward making the United States and Kentucky competitive in coal production again. 
Stivers, who was among Kentuckians present when Trump signed the executive orders last week, told reporters Tuesday morning Trump is offering a “two-pronged approach” by first incentivizing coal mining and distribution and then expediting the process to get coal mining permits. Stivers said the policies put “Kentucky in a good position” to be “a low-cost energy producer.” 
Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

Stivers said producing more coal is also a national security issue, so the U.S. can control more of its own resources instead of relying on importing energy materials. The U.S. already has significantly decreased its dependence on energy from other countries.
The U.S. has been a net exporter of energy since 2019, reports the U.S. Energy Information Agency, and a net coal exporter since at least 1949. In 2023, annual U.S. coal exports increased by about 15% and equaled about 8% of total energy exports, reports the agency. The U.S. is most dependent on other countries for crude oil which accounted for the largest share of U.S. energy imports in 2023.
When Stivers was elected to the legislature in 1997, the state generated nearly $300 million annually in coal severance tax, he said. In the last few years, it’s been close to $100 million, which is a “a reflection of production,” which has declined steeply, Stivers added. 
The Trump administration policies are likely to be an economic booster in Kentucky, Stivers predicted. Coal production in Stivers’ home of Clay County in Eastern Kentucky peaked at 2.5 million tons annually in 1980, according to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Clay County now produces no coal. 
In recent years, Western Kentucky — led by an Alliance Resource Partners mine in Union County — has surpassed Eastern Kentucky in coal production. 
  Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers posted photos of his White House visit on X, formerly Twitter. (Screenshot)
Alliance Partners CEO Joe Craft, a Republican megadonor, also was at the White House with Stivers last week to watch Trump vow to revive “beautiful, clean coal,” a promise he also made in his first term.
“It won’t just be miners going back to work,” Stivers said. “It’ll be all the peripheral jobs that will come back, that you’ll see that used to be there … supply stores, lumber companies, little grocery stores, mom and pop operations. That’s the hope.” 
Kentucky generated about 68% of its electricity from coal in 2023, the third-highest of all states. Over the last 25 years, Kentucky has fallen from producing the country’s cheapest power to the 12th cheapest as natural gas, solar and wind have often become cheaper than maintaining aging coal-fired power plants. The last large coal-fired power plant built in the country was in 2013.
During the press conference, Stivers pushed back on fossil fuels like coal contributing to climate change. He said “the assumption that fossil fuels are a contributor to climate change is subject to debate.” Stivers’ assertion contradicts scientific studies that consistently identify the heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — as by far the leading cause of climate change. 
“If it is a factor in climate change, do you want us with some of the strongest regulatory processes doing more fossil fuels than shipping it and allowing our products to be produced in Russia, China and India that have limited or no environmental concerns and produce way more than what anybody in the United States does in the realm of fossil fuels contaminants?” Stivers said. “I would rather do it here. We’re more cognizant of potential impacts, or at least aware there is an argument of that.” 
China in 2023 released more heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions than any other country, followed by the U.S, India, the European Union and Russia, according to an independent tally. Historically, the U.S. is the world’s  No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases emissions, which accumulate in the atmosphere, because of the country’s earlier and rapid industrialization dating back to the 1800s. 
Special legislative session coming?
During the Tuesday press conference, Stivers also was asked about the response to Kentucky’s recent devastating floods, which have renewed conversations about the state’s disaster funds. Before the legislature finished the 2025 legislative session, it passed a law to create a new state aid fund for communities affected by February floods. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said it would not be “enough” to cover damage from those storms. Beshear also has warned that a spending cap imposed by the legislature will limit state resources available for flood recovery.
When asked about Beshear’s concern that the state could run out of funding if it faces another natural disaster this year, Stivers said he finds Beshear’s “lack of knowledge problematic” and that calling the legislature into a special legislative for one day would cost less than the governor traveling to Davos, Switzerland, for an economic forum, or paying the salary of Beshear’s Senior Adviser Rocky Adkins, a former House speaker. 
“He is creating a crisis without the crisis existing,” Stivers said. “One day is all it takes.”

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho will try to ban a food assistance program from covering candy and soda.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which requires the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement known as “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers. 
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement Tuesday. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
 How will the SNAP bill affect local retailers?

Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws. 
Idaho’s new law takes effect July 1.

In a prepared statement, Washington, DC.-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center SNAP Deputy Director Gina Plata-Nino critiqued SNAP restrictions, saying they “only deepen food insecurity and strip people of their autonomy.”
“This push to restrict what Idaho households can buy is an ill-conceived, recycled attempt to shame people who need food assistance and strip them of their dignity and autonomy when data shows that their diet isn’t much different from anyone else’s,” Plata-Nino told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Little signed the bill into law on Tuesday, the governor’s office announced in a news release. The bill passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments. 
In the Idaho governor’s office news release announcing Little signed the bill, Kennedy wrote in a prepared statement, “I urge all governors to follow Idaho’s lead and submit innovative SNAP waivers to the USDA to reverse the childhood chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
 Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say

Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight. 
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.

Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact on the state budget.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement she was excited more states “are heeding the call to Make America Healthy Again.”
“Governor Little is a true partner to USDA, and we look forward to working together on ways to use SNAP to improve health outcomes for Americans and encourage better use of taxpayer dollars,” she added.

Ten schools across Delaware have been awarded the Purple Star School designation for 2025, a recognition of their exceptional efforts to support students from military families.
The honored schools span two districts: Caesar Rodney School District’s Allen Frear Elementary, David E. Robinson Elementary, Major George S. Welch Elementary, Nellie Stokes Elementary, and Star Hill Elementary, and Lake Forest School District’s Lake Forest Central Elementary, East Elementary, North Elementary, South Elementary, and W.T. Chipman Middle School.
The schools will be officially recognized this afternoon during a ceremony where Governor Matt Meyer will also proclaim April as the Month of the Military Child—a national observance highlighting the challenges faced by children whose families serve in the armed forces.

Military members’ children make sacrifices just like their parents and caregivers, missing time with their loved ones when they are deployed overseas and sometimes making frequent school transitions when their families’ military stations change.
“These children face challenges and have needs unique to their non-military peers. I thank these schools for recognizing the hardships and seeking ways to better support these students,” said Jennifer Davis, Delaware commissioner for the Military Interstate Children’s Compact Commission. “Military members’ children make sacrifices just like their parents and caregivers—missing time with loved ones and often changing schools. I thank these schools for recognizing the hardships and seeking ways to better support these students.”
Schools that receive the Purple Star designation must meet several criteria, including appointing a dedicated military liaison, offering school-wide training for staff, providing online resources for military families, and implementing transition programs and peer support systems.
At Allen Frear Elementary, for example, students with deployed parents or those adjusting to new environments can participate in peer-to-peer support groups facilitated by the school counselor.
These groups provide a space for children to connect, share experiences, and build resilience.
W.T. Chipman Middle School cited its comprehensive approach—including structured transition programs, mentorship opportunities, and family engagement efforts—as key to creating a welcoming environment for military-connected students.
Delaware’s Purple Star designation remains valid for three years.
As part of the ongoing commitment, schools must continue to demonstrate support for military families through programming, training, and community engagement.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/purple-star.png,,,2025-04-15 12:18:27.898653

Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, on April 10, 2025, on the House floor condemned a veto override of legislation allowing LGBTQ+ kids in foster care to be placed in religious households that may disagree with their gender identity or sexual orientation. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The way Kansas LGBTQ+ youths in foster care are placed into homes could change after lawmakers forced a bill into law that permits foster children to be placed with families who don’t affirm a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity based on the parents’ religious or moral beliefs.
Republicans argued that Kansas is at risk of losing needed foster families, and the bill prevents the state from discriminating against parents, even though their beliefs might conflict with a child’s sexuality or gender identity. 
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, vetoed the bill April 7, characterizing it as a departure from the Kansas Department for Children and Families’ adherence to the “best interest of the child” standard.
“Legislation like this detracts from this standard and stands in the way of best serving those in the child welfare system,” Kelly wrote in her veto message.
She also feared the legislation could open the state up to lawsuits.
The House overrode House Bill 2311 Thursday in an 87-38 vote, with Emporia Republican Rep. Mark Schreiber joining Democrats in opposition. Senate Republicans overrode it the same day in a 31-9 vote along party lines.
Kerrie Lonard of the Kansas Office of the Child Advocate said her office recognizes the proponents’ intent, the concerns of those opposed and the possibility for unintended consequences.
It will be “cognizant,” Lonard said, of the implementation of HB 2311, which includes “recruitment and training of foster parents, and in placement decisions, specific to increased placement options or potential harm or actions that do not maintain best interest of the child as the guiding center.”
Foster care youths are entitled to basic rights under the Gail Finney Memorial Foster Care Bill of Rights, which was codified in 2023.
Embedded in that bill of rights, Lonard said, is the right to “live in a safe, comfortable placement,” to “be treated with respect” and to live with “someone from such child’s community with similar religious beliefs or ethnic heritage.”
The office “will advocate that placement decisions are made with respect to foster children’s statutorily protected rights and in their best interests,” Lonard said.
HB 2311, which is set to go into law as soon as it is published in the Kansas Register, forbids the state’s foster care agency from creating policies for a child’s placement, custody or adoption that require a foster parent to “affirm, accept or support” a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity that may conflict with the parents’ religious or moral beliefs. It bars rejections of eligible foster parents based on their religious or moral beliefs on sexuality or gender. 
The state cannot reject parents if they intend “to guide or instruct a child” consistent with their beliefs, the bill said.
People can sue the agency for damages and attorney fees if barriers to foster care or adoption are enforced after July 1.
The Kansas foster care system has endured a rocky history, and it is currently measuring court-mandated improvements to course correct. Brenna Visocsky of the Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, which submitted testimony to the House Committee on Child Welfare, said HB 2311 doesn’t fix any of the state’s prevailing problems. She said it furthers them instead.
“Considering that conversion therapy is still legal in this state, there is the potential for serious harm coming to LGBTQ children placed with anti-LGBTQ foster parents,” said Visocsky.
Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative Christian legal advocacy group, applauded the effort and Kansas Family Voice, a Christian organization that lobbies on abortion, sexuality and parental rights.
Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the alliance, said other states have put politics over people when it comes to religious families in the foster care system, but not Kansas.
“The Kansas Legislature correctly voted to override Gov. Kelly’s misguided veto,” he said in a statement. “This is a critical step to prioritize the well-being of kids by prohibiting state and local government officials from discriminating against adoption and foster care providers and parents simply because of their religious beliefs and moral convictions.”
Rep. Jarrod Ousley, a Merriam Democrat, said the bill puts the foster parents’ sincerely held religious beliefs ahead of kids’ sexual orientation or gender identity.
“This was a bad bill when we heard it last time,” Ousley said on the House floor. “This sends a terrible signal to a vulnerable population in the state of Kansas.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, rebutted the idea that religious freedoms are under attack.
“Religious liberty is well-protected in Kansas,” she said. “What is not well protected in Kansas are children and their rights.”
The bill isn’t needed, she said.
“The purpose of the bill really is to discriminate against a certain child,” Ruiz said, “a child that may be talking, speaking about, that they may be transgender.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100393-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-15 12:18:27.898653

A Montana man shed hunting in the north-central part of the state shot and killed a grizzly bear on April 11, after it reportedly charged him at close range.
According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the hunter was not harmed during the encounter.
The man was searching for antlers on a brushy hillside near Dupuyer when he first saw the adult grizzly. As he left the area, the bear charged at him and the man shot and killed the bear, according to FWP.
The bear was an adult female grizzly estimated to be 13 years old in good condition, according to FWP, with no history of conflict with humans.
FWP also reported the sow had a single yearling cub that was found on site, unharmed, but wildlife officials will not take management action for the yearling.
This is the 1st known grizzly bear mortality in 2025 according to FWP’s grizzly mortality dashboard.
The dashboard was launched last year to help the agency increase transparency, educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected, and to show that the state is ready to manage the species on its own.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Scurrying to pass a budget this week as the Tennessee legislature prepares to adjourn, lawmakers are putting their own stamp on the state’s budget despite being hampered by federal cuts that eat into the spending plan.
Republican chairs of the House and Senate finance committee remain uncertain about the impact of reductions in the $24.5 billion the state receives from the federal government.
Similarly, Democrats are asking Gov. Bill Lee’s administration to clue them in on federal cuts that could affect the proposed $59.6 billion spending plan, which is undergoing a bit of transformation as lawmakers put their own ideas into the budget. 
With federal funds making up nearly 42% of the state’s budget, Democrats sent a letter Monday to Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson notifying him that lawmakers need a “clear understanding of current and anticipating reductions” to make decisions.
Federal funds make up 93.4% of Human Services funding, 78.4% of the Department of Military, 61% of the TennCare Bureau, 51.5% of the Transportation Department and 57.8% of the Health Department.
“Understanding the depth and scope of these changes is imperative, not only for budgetary accuracy but also for anticipating impacts on essential services and public trust,” the letter signed by House and Senate Democrats says.



				Federal funds make up nearly 42% of Tennessee’s budget, including 93% of state Human Services funding, 78.4% of the Department of Military and 57.8% of the Tennessee Department of Health.			


The Finance and Administration Department did not respond immediately to questions.
House finance committee Chairman Gary Hicks said this week he is hearing continually from departments about budget cuts emanating from Washington, D.C. He could not pinpoint any large items but said reductions have been made across several areas, such as the Department of Health, forcing the state to find funds to keep programs going. Lawmakers put $4 million Monday into county health departments to make up for grant reductions from the Centers for Disease Control.
As lawmakers started adding their own touches to the budget Monday, they removed tens of millions from the governor’s proposals and added items such as $3 million to an audit of Memphis Shelby County Schools, which would come on top of $3 million already in the governor’s plan for an audit, increased the Attorney General’s Office budget by $4.5 million and inserted $35 million to extend a tax break to broadband internet companies.
“We’re all watching to see what the federal government’s going to do, because quite frankly we don’t know what that’s gonna look like,” Hicks said. “I certainly support what they’re doing up there with trying to make cuts where it’s necessary. So we’ll have our nose pressed to the glass like everybody else to see how that will affect (the state).”
  Tennessee lawmakers have talked about “contingencies” in case of major reductions in federal funds, but they have no “formal plan” to deal with them, said Senate Finance Chair Bo Watson, a Hixson Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Likewise, Senate finance Chairman Bo Watson said cuts are coming in several areas, ranging from the Department of Human Services to the Education Department but predicted that lawmakers won’t know the scope of reductions before the legislature adjourns, especially considering Congress is working on its budget.
“We’ve got to move forward regardless of what’s happening at the federal level,” said Watson, a Hixson Republican. “Hopefully, we can get the budget out this week.”
Tennessee lawmakers have talked about “contingencies” in case of major reductions, but they have no “formal plan” to deal with them, Watson said.
Among the cuts coming from the Trump administration, Second Harvest Food Bank in East Tennessee canceled more than 377,000 pounds of food costing $722,000 because of a funding pause, according to Democrats. 
The Department of Health is ending sexually transmitted infection (STI) monitoring contractors, a move leading Metro Nashville to file suit.
TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program for 1.7 million low-income people, could see funding gaps because of the expiration of a federal match.
In addition, state residents are likely to see energy assistance reductions, some of which could affect 1,000 households in upper East Tennessee, according to Democrats’ letter.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/States Newsroom)Consumer sentiment fell more than 10% in the last month, and according to the University of Michigan’s latest national consumer survey, it’s the fourth straight month of decline.
“Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year. Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu in a release.
Hsu added that the drop was “pervasive and unanimous” across multiple factors including age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.
The index is published monthly by the university, and is an indicator of consumers’ confidence in the health of the U.S. economy.
The results, released Friday, came just two days after President Donald Trump reversed course on sweeping tariffs on imported goods, pausing them for 90 days, while keeping in place an across-the-board 10% duty as well as separate tariffs on specific commodities.
While the university’s survey concluded the day before Trump’s announced pause, Hsu said the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has been increasing for five consecutive months and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since the Great Recession.
“This lack of labor market confidence lies in sharp contrast to the past several years, when robust spending was supported primarily by strong labor markets and incomes,” said Hsu.
Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told business journalists at a speech in Virginia that while there was a “still solid” outlook on economic growth, surveys of households and businesses reported “dimming expectations and higher uncertainty” in reaction to Trump administration policies, especially as they related to trade.
The University of Michigan survey noted that inflation expectations for the coming year “surged from 5.0% last month to 6.7% this month,” which was the highest reading in nearly 45 years. That rise was also seen across the political spectrum.
“Long-run inflation expectations climbed from 4.1% in March to 4.4% in April, reflecting a particularly large jump among independents,” said Hsu.

House Bill 133, “NC Farmland and Military Protection Act,” sponsored by Reps. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), Neal Jackson (R-Moore, Randolph), Jeff Zenger (R-Forsyth), and John Bell (R-Goldsboro), would ban “adversarial” foreign governments from purchasing, acquiring, or leasing agricultural land in North Carolina.
The restrictions would also apply to land situated within a 75-mile radius of a military installation — a number influenced by national defense recommendations, Balkcom said — such as Fort Bragg near Fayetteville. A complete list of applicable installations is outlined in the bill text.
The measure comes at the same time that international tensions have been on the rise amidst the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign trade partners.
HB 133 defines “adversarial” foreign governments as the ones subject to the U.S. State Department’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, according to the bill text, but does not explicitly outline the nations.
Its counterpart in the upper chamber, Senate Bill 394, “Prohibit Foreign Ownership of NC Land,” passed the Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee last week and specifies the “adversarial” governments as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
Rep. Phil Sheperd (R-Onslow) asked if the bill had anything to do with legislation in previous years aimed towards reimbursing farmers for the purchase of their land.
Balkcom responded that the bill is more of a preventative measure. Instead of incentivizing farmers to sell their land, it targets foreign groups and bars them from purchasing the property.
“This is basically protecting it from being able to sell, those who do were not given any incentive to do it,” she said.
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) brought up the legality and constitutionality of preventing a landowner from selling their property to a ready, willing buyer.
“Private property rights are crucial here, but so is national security,” Balkcom said. “The way we look at this bill doesn’t impact private buyers or U.S. companies. It applies only to entities controlled by foreign governments designated an adversary from our own federal agency.”
The bill now heads to the House Rules Committee.
Youth social media ban
The committee also approved House Bill 301, “Social Media Protections for Minors Under 16.”
According to a legislative staff summary, the bill would — among other things:

Prohibit social media platforms from allowing minors under the age of 14 to create an account.
Prohibit social media platforms from allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to create an account without parental consent.
Require social media platforms to use age verification to verify the age of account holders.
Authorize the Department of Justice to bring an action for unfair and deceptive trade practices against a social medial platform that violates these provisions and collect a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation.
Authorize a civil action on behalf of a minor account holder and an award of up to $10,000 in
damages.

(Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Around 150,000 student athletes from over 100 colleges had their personal data breached by former University of Michigan assistant football coach Matt Weiss, who hacked their accounts to download thousands of their private intimate photos, according to federal investigators. Now more than 50 women are suing Weiss and the institutions they say failed them.
One of the Jane Does who joined a class action suit against Weiss said the news of the data breach feels like deja vu, saying that she is a survivor of disgraced former Michigan State University physician Larry Nassar who is effectively serving three life sentences for possession of child pornography and sexually assaulting women and girls under the guise of medical treatment.
Another man with power over student athletes and influence in a university was able to exploit their access to students and again, a university “allowed it to happen and said nothing,” the woman said invoking MSU’s highly criticized response to Nassar’s abuse.
“It’s hard to describe the heartbreak of realizing that another institution we trusted has failed to protect us. After everything we went through with Nassar—and all the promises of change that followed—you want to believe that things will be different. That those in power will finally put athlete safety, privacy, and dignity first,” the woman told Michigan Advance. “Accountability should mean more than empty words—it has to involve meaningful, sustained action to prevent harm and rebuild trust. Right now, that still feels a long way off.”
‘It’s not over’: Survivors of Nassar’s abuse say the fight for justice is far from finished

The March indictment states investigators found that from 2015 until 2023, Weiss accessed a database used by athletic trainers at more than 100 colleges and universities and maintained by a third-party vendor, Keffer Development Services in Pennsylvania, to access student and alumni social media and cloud storage accounts in order to download private intimate images.
The allegations in the indictment occurred before and during his tenure at Michigan, where he was employed from February 2021 to January 2023. Before working at the university, he spent more than a decade with the Baltimore Ravens. Weiss was fired in January 2023 shortly after university police opened an investigation into reported computer crimes on the school’s Ann Arbor campus.
Weiss’ time at the university was limited, Kay Jarvis, Michigan director of public affairs, said in a statement Monday, adding the university responded quickly to reports of criminal activity.
The indictment said Weiss would research each targeted athlete for months, even years in some instances, looking for more and more photos and videos, keeping notes on each individual’s body and sexual preference.

MIE_Weiss Indictment 
Weiss was able to get into 3,300 individuals’ emails, social media and cloud storage accounts, the indictment said.
Weiss, who has pled not guilty, was charged March 20 with 24 counts of computer-related crimes. He could not be reached for comment.
News that thousands of students may have had their private images stolen has sent many former and current athletes into a panic. Many have used aliases to protect their identities in the civil suits except for McKenzie Johnson, who told Michigan Advance during a news conference Monday that she hopes by putting a name and a face to this violation, it will help shine a light on it.
Johnson played softball for Grambling State University in Louisiana from 2015 to 2019. She said she’s very concerned what images Weiss may have allegedly gotten his hands on as she navigates the workforce as a young professional.
“I don’t understand how something like this could happen. It’s my goal from this lawsuit to learn more about what has occurred. I can personally say that I’m very anxious about what will come from this and what personal information that he has stolen from me,” Johnson said.

The lawsuits name the university, its regents and Keffer Development Services as defendants.
What Weiss is accused of is nothing short of sexual violence, Megan Bonanni, the attorney representing the woman identifying herself as a Nassar survivor and 10 other women in a civil suit, told Michigan Advance.
“This is a digital sexual assault,” Bonnani said. “…And just like a physical sexual assault, the amount of trauma, the amount of complete uncertainty… that’s what we’re seeing from our clients. They do not feel safe, and this feeling that they are unsafe is going to continue into the future.” 
None of the women she is representing, mostly former University of Michigan athletes, have received notification from university officials that their data may have been compromised, Bonnani said. The university could have been an ally to these athletes and supported them, Bonnani added.
Jarvis said in the statement: “Upon learning of potentially concerning activity in its systems, the University promptly placed Mr. Weiss on leave, forwarded this matter to law enforcement authorities and moved forward with Mr. Weiss’ termination on January 21, 2023.”
The woman identifying as a Nassar survivor said the university failed to protect athletes, secure their data and alert students and athletes to change their passwords.
“Matt Weiss should never have had the opportunity to violate student privacy, and the University had a responsibility to safeguard our information and be transparent when that trust was broken. Instead, they stayed silent. That’s not just negligence—it’s betrayal,” the woman told Michigan Advance. 
The images and media belonged to the athletes and they had every right to privacy and to victim blame would be to miss the point, said attorney Lisa Esser-Weidenfeller, who is collaborating with Bonnani.
“None of these women, none of them, did anything wrong,” Esser-Weidenfeller said. “I just want to make that super clear. Sometimes you read these stories and you start to read the comments. None of these women, none of these athletes, did anything wrong to contribute to this, right? I mean, it’s like being invaded in the privacy of your own home.”
Bonnani said none of the athletes she’s representing know specifically what images or information were compromised and whose hands they may have been exchanged to.
The civil lawsuits filed in the last month have depicted how the data breach has disrupted student athletes’ lives. One plaintiff, a junior competing for the university referred to as  “Jane Roe,” said she was shocked and humiliated to learn of the data breach on the news and not from the school.
“Plaintiff seeks to hold the Defendants accountable for their actions and inactions that have caused immense fear, anxiety, humiliation, loss of dignity, and loss of privacy that cannot simply be undone,’’ the lawsuit said. 
It was not the first time a University of Michigan staffer was accused of using their position to exploit students. 
More than 1,000 individuals have come forward in recent years with accusations of sexual assault by the late Robert Anderson, a physician who practiced at the university for nearly four decades. The university settled with survivors for $490 million in 2022, but like in the case of Nassar at MSU, survivors have railed for change at university governance meetings and protested for years begging the school to create safeguards for athletes.

 The Army of Survivors, an advocacy group working to protect athletes from sexual violence, said in a statement, Michigan has offered no meaningful public acknowledgment of the harm athletes are facing nor commitment to reviewing accountability structures. 
 “These victims are not footnotes to a scandal, they are human beings whose trust was betrayed, whose dignity was stolen, and who deserve far more than a university’s carefully worded deflections,’’ the group said in the statement. “They deserve answers. They deserve justice. And they deserve institutions willing to stand up and say: ‘We failed you. And we will do better.’”
Real justice, the woman said, would have meant survivors were listened to the first time. It also means reclaiming power, she added.
“For me, justice in this case means more than just punishing one person. It means exposing the full scope of the failure and holding the institution accountable,” the woman said.

Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat from Thornton, speaks at a press conference in Brighton on Aug. 2, 2023. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo is seeking a rematch in 2026 against Rep. Gabe Evans, the Republican who unseated her in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District last year.
“The 8th District deserves a representative who’s looking out for them but Gabe Evans has already shown that he will always put Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and his MAGA backers in Washington first,” Caraveo said in a press release Tuesday announcing her 2026 campaign. “I can’t stand by while Gabe Evans tries to rip away health care from tens of thousands of Coloradans, including the very families I served as a pediatrician, and make life harder for working families.”
Caraveo was elected in 2022 as the first-ever representative for the 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The district is the state’s most diverse — about 40% of its residents are Latino — and most competitive House seat. Caraveo won election in 2022 by about 1,600 votes out of more than 236,000 ballots cast, then lost to Evans by about 2,500 votes last year.
During her time in Congress, Caraveo faced criticism from some progressive Democrats for her moderate voting record, which represented a move to the center relative to her tenure in the state Legislature, where she was a representative. She said during her 2024 reelection bid that her political shift reflected what she called a “responsibility to portray the opinions of my constituents” in a “very evenly divided” district.
By contrast, Evans, also former state representative, has been an unapologetic supporter of his party’s agenda. He has affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to carry out mass deportations of tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and remained silent on the administration’s effort to end birthright citizenship. Last month, Evans voted for House Republicans’ sweeping budget resolution to cut taxes and slash social spending, and he has since falsely claimed that the plan would not force drastic cuts to Medicaid, as nonpartisan congressional budget analysts conclude that it would.
Caraveo’s announcement sets up a primary contest with Democratic state Rep. Manny Rutinel, who previously announced he would challenge Evans and reported a strong first-quarter fundraising haul of over $1 million.
With Republicans holding just a three-vote majority in the House, the 8th District race could again prove crucial in determining control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. The National Republican Congressional Committee on Tuesday quickly slammed Caraveo as a “radical” and predicted the Democratic primary would be a “race to please the far left.”
“While Gabe Evans is delivering commonsense solutions, whoever emerges from the Democrats’ radical rat race will be just another out-of-touch liberal ready to be rejected by Coloradans,” said NRCC spokesperson Zach Bannon.

(File photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)As a former regulator on the South Carolina Public Service Commission, I’ve kept up with national trends that could impact our state and your bank account.
Guess I’m still in the habit.
Here’s a national trend that has the potential to dramatically increase electric utility bills for all classes of ratepayers: new data centers.
State lawmakers around the United States have long sought to attract new industries with generous tax breaks and financial incentives.
But research analysts with Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies, have said these data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenues to cover their tax breaks. The alarm bells are ringing.
We need to stop recruiting new data centers.
Good Jobs First concluded that new data centers are “not a winning program for state budgets.”
Legislators in other states have discovered the increasing risks that data centers bring with them.
Data centers often require upgrades to the state electricity grid. These added costs for new transformers, substations and distribution lines will have to be paid for by all ratepayers through increased utility bills.
New Jersey state Rep. Bob Smith, a Democrat, said “we have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on our citizens.”
Data centers typically run nonstop. They need much more electric power compared to manufacturing plants.
In Oregon, state Democratic Rep. Pam Marsh said “there’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh sponsored a bill that would require data centers to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for their added costs.
Utah just passed a new law that allows large load customers like data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities as a way to insulate residential customers from increasing electricity bills.
Tyson Slocum is the energy program director for Public Citizen, a consumer advocate nonprofit. He observed that “the normal model is you spread that investment costs across all customers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Gary Wood, CEO with Central Virginia Electric Cooperative has more than 30 years of experience in electrical engineering. Wood says that rolling blackouts are very likely in his region in the next few years. He’s concerned about growing electricity loads that these data centers are bringing with them.
A December study commissioned by Virginia legislators found that power demand in the state could double in a decade and increase by up to 183% by 2040.”
Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recently found that consumption could reach more than 30,000 gigawatt hours per month due to new data centers.
Just one gigawatt is a billion watts. To put that in perspective, that’s equal to nearly 2 million solar panels.
The Virginia commission found that new solar facilities, wind generation, new gas plants and transmission facilities will all be needed to meet “unconstrained demand,” which will be “very difficult to achieve.”
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has taken steps to reduce the impact of increasing demand for electricity.
FERC recently approved a request to keep some older power plants running past their expected retirement. The commission also recommended pairing renewable sources like solar with battery storage with natural gas plants.
While this strategy will help, it still won’t meet the challenges created by increasing demand.
Here are my suggestions for South Carolina lawmakers and utilities to consider:
1. Eliminate all financial incentives and tax breaks to new data centers who want to locate in South Carolina.
2. Encourage data centers already here to improve their energy efficiency with newer more efficient computer chips while implementing energy management standards.
3. Require Duke, Dominion and Santee Cooper to create demand response programs for any utility customers who use 25 megawatts or more per year. This would reduce their financial impact on other ratepayers. It would also reduce the impact of future rolling blackouts.
4. Allow South Carolina electric cooperatives to create their own for-profit subsidiaries to provide electricity through retail sales to their customers with load capacity exceeding 90 megawatts.
5. Require electric utilities to install advanced conductors which use aluminum cores instead of steel cores in all new transmission lines. This change would increase transmission capacity by 50%.
These changes can enable South Carolina to meet the increasing demand for electric power.

Laura Kelly sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Education requesting the administration of President Donald Trump reverse a decision to freeze $22.6 million allocated to the state for benefit of students and teachers. This is a 2023 image of Kelly meeting students at Jardine Elementary in Topeka. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly said Tuesday a request was submitted to the U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to reinstate more than $22 million in federal funding appropriated to Kansas to help students who fell behind during the COVID-19 pandemic catch up with peers and to retrain teachers in the science of reading.
The U.S. Department of Education announced in March that approximately $3 billion in pandemic relief funds would be frozen nationwide.
The Kansas State Department of Education had received an extension on the deadline for expending the funds, but the federal government’s latest maneuver reversed that decision. The state Department of Education requested the administration of President Donald Trump set aside the latest plan to sweep the $22.6 million allocated to Kansas. That request is pending at the federal level.
“Abruptly stripping this funding is a disservice to the Kansas students and teachers who rely on it to excel in the classroom,” Kelly said.
In Kansas, the funding in jeopardy was allocated to supporting student learning recovery and ensuring the education workforce was prepared to assist those students with academic deficiencies. The aid also was used to retrain teachers in reading instruction, support students’ career and college exploration and to lower start-up costs for child care providers.
In addition, a portion of the funds was relied on to cover the cost of  licensure, fingerprinting and background check fees for early childhood educators. The Kelly administration began waiving the fees using federal and state funds in 2021. The fees will be reinstated until the Trump administration restores Kansas’ funding allocation, the governor said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2210447-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-15 11:13:25.329018

The room is dim, with the shades drawn, and the faint scent of cigarette smoke lingers.
She is surrounded by pictures of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, while watching the Home Shopping Network on TV and listening to her two rescue cockatiels, Pretty Girl and Charlie, chirp.
At 76-years-old, Bell has lived in the same apartment in Hartford’s Frog Hollow neighborhood for nearly four decades. It was from that apartment that she raised her three children and cared for her eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
Bell has relied on federal Section 8, or Housing Choice Vouchers, for more than 50 years.
She first received housing assistance as a 25-year-old single mother of three, a decade after moving to Connecticut from Georgia. In Georgia, Bell said assistance like Section 8 wasn’t readily available.
“If you didn’t work, have a little shack of your own, you were in trouble. You had nothing,” Bell said.
Bell is worried about the potential impact federal cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration will have on social services, like housing assistance and social security. Even with the Section 8 voucher, Bell pays $800 a month in rent.
If the worst comes, Bell’s family would take her in. She’s more concerned about others.
“I know how it will be. A person with three or four little kids trying to go to work, trying to pay daycare, they not going to be able to do it,” Bell said.
Bell is one of about 161,000 Connecticut residents who rely on federal rental assistance, which is under threat.
Connecticut’s housing aid needs
The Trump administration named Connecticut among 34 states that may lose their field office for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In 2023, Connecticut received more than $1 billion in funding for federal rental assistance programs.
Brittany Ignace is an attorney with Greater Hartford Legal Aid. Ignace helps low-income residents, including Bell, secure housing aid.
“Many of our clients are seniors or they’re people with disabilities,” Ignace said. “The HUD cuts will have a devastating impact on many families across the state.”
A potential scaling back of HUD support would lead directly to an increase in homelessness, Ignace said. She’s concerned for what her clients’ futures may look like without housing security.
“We see people struggle every day to afford rent, and that matters. This is going to matter for people,” Ignace said. “It is going to affect thousands of families in Connecticut, and it is going to cause a rise in homelessness.”
It’s hard to predict what tangible effect a potential cut would have on Connecticut renters, Ignace said.
“We do think it’s too early to tell,” Ignace said. “What we expect is that a lot of people are going to lose the public housing or vouchers.”

Potential HUD cuts unclear
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said he and his Congressional colleagues on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, have contacted HUD four times for clarification on what, if any, field offices will be eliminated. They received no response.
HUD officials told Connecticut Public that while there were no announced field office closures, the office is exploring consolidation. HUD released a statement which said:
“HUD has not announced any field office closures. To be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, HUD is exploring consolidation while ensuring service to the American people remains the priority.”
HUD field offices are needed, because they do more than administer Section 8 housing vouchers, according to Blumenthal.
“We all know by now that providing a roof over somebody’s head is not the answer. That roof has to be accompanied by counseling and job training and sometimes treatment for substance abuse disorder,” Blumenthal said.
Nationwide, more than $260 million in contracts for housing aid have been canceled.
All citizens should be concerned, as a lack of housing aid would further exacerbate an already strained housing market, according to Blumenthal.
With the potential loss of Connecticut’s HUD field office, Blumenthal is unsure what would become of the state’s housing needs and federal aid recipients.
“We’d have to go, probably, to some regional office in New York or Boston,” Blumenthal said.
But the lack of clarity is part of the problem.
Changes to HUD haven’t specifically called for the defunding or scaling back of financial support for Section 8, but proposals by Trump’s administration call for the firing of half of the HUD staff that administers Housing Choice Vouchers.
There is a lot of confusion surrounding the Trump administration’s execution of cuts to federal jobs and programs, Blumenthal said.
“They fire people first and plan if they’re going to plan at all. And so far, we see no plan for what the field offices are doing, who specifically are going to lose their jobs. It’s all chaos,” Blumenthal said.

Potential HUD cuts may impact CT programs
HUD’s removal would impact more than Section 8 recipients.
Connecticut’s Rental Assistance Program (RAP) may also feel the pressure, according to Chelsea Ross, executive director of the housing policy advocacy group Partnership for Strong Communities.
“We’re concerned about federal cuts to federal funded rental assistance having huge ripple effects everywhere around the country, but in the state as well,” Ross said.
RAP operates in largely the same way as Section 8. The main difference being RAP is funded solely by the state budget and doesn’t rely on federal support.
About 6,500 Connecticut households receive RAP benefits, Ross said. The program’s waitlist has only opened twice in the last 17 years. The last time the waitlist opened was for a week in 2014, when 86,000 residents applied for aid.
Back in Hartford, Mattie Bell says despite what may happen with federal housing aid, she’s vowing to help her neighbors. Local communities have been stepping up to take care of each other, but politics get in the way.
“It’s a scary situation. It’s a sad situation, because we try to help make things better, and yet that is tearing down what people are doing, tearing it down,” Bell said.

U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s order temporarily prohibits the removal of “all noncitizens […],"A view of the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver on May 30, 2023. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Monday ordered President Donald Trump’s administration not to deport any detainees held in Colorado under the 1798 law it invoked last month to send hundreds of people to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s order temporarily prohibits the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Pursuant to that law, Trump’s order claims that the United States is under “invasion” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was the basis for the deportation last month of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the U.S. government is paying for them to be held.
About 90% of the deportees have no criminal record and only a handful had been charged with serious crimes, Bloomberg reported last week. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for many other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.

Sweeney’s order came after lawyers for two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Saturday. Both of the men, who are identified only by their initials out of fear for their safety, have been falsely accused of TdA affiliation and face removal to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act, their attorneys wrote.
The first plaintiff, known as D.B.U., is a 32-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado with his wife and two children. According to the filing, he was arrested during a Jan. 26 raid by Drug Enforcement Administration agents on a makeshift nightclub in Adams County. The DEA’s Rocky Mountain field office described the event as a “Tren de Aragua party,” but subsequently acknowledged that many of those arrested were from countries other than Venezuela, including some European countries, and has refused to release the names of the people taken into custody, say how many of them are suspected TdA members or disclose other details of the operation.
The Colorado lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union, says that D.B.U. fears he will be deported under the Alien Enemies Act because of the DEA’s characterizations of the party, and because he has “a single tattoo of his niece’s name.”
The second plaintiff, R.M.M., not only denies being a member of TdA but says he fled Venezuela to seek asylum after the gang murdered two of his family members. He lived in Aurora with his wife and two children prior to his arrest on March 1. Nearly six weeks later, his attorneys wrote, a “heavily redacted” ICE filing accused him of TdA membership.
“R.M.M. is not and has never been a member of TdA, and in fact, lives in fear of the gang that has already killed two of his family members,” the lawsuit says. “R.M.M. has several tattoos for personal reasons, including one of his birth year, another of a family-member’s name, and a tattoo of religious significance, but they have nothing to do with TdA.”
The ACLU’s lawsuit in Colorado follows two similar challenges in Texas and New York, in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling last week that allowed deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to continue, but only if detainees are given due process and the opportunity to challenge their removal in court. Trump administration officials have subsequently said that detainees could be given 24 hours’ notice of their deportation, putting the plaintiffs and other Colorado detainees “at imminent risk of removal,” the lawsuit says.
“That suggestion not only defies the Supreme Court’s instructions but could mean that petitioners may fail to get meaningful notice or opportunity to seek judicial review before being sent permanently to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, where they could spend the rest of their lives,” ACLU attorneys wrote.
False and exaggerated TdA claims
Trump promised to invoke the Alien Enemies Act during a 2024 campaign stop in Aurora, a city he described as having been “invaded and conquered” by TdA. It was one of a series of false and exaggerated claims about the extent of the gang’s activity in Colorado made by Trump, his top immigration advisers and local far-right political figures in the heat of the 2024 presidential campaign.
Denver and Aurora police officials consistently characterized the gang’s presence as “isolated” and relatively small. The gang has been linked with criminal activity at several Aurora apartment complexes that were home to large numbers of Venezuelan migrants, some of whom sought to blame an absentee “slumlord” who had allowed the buildings to fall into squalor. Contrary to claims by far-right figures that crime has “skyrocketed” in Aurora since the new immigrants arrived, crime rates, consistent with national trends, have declined there and in Colorado as a whole since 2022.
At least two dozen alleged TdA members were arrested for various crimes by Denver-area police departments in 2024. Despite a high-profile attempt to crack down on the gang in recent months — part of a nationwide effort that Trump, during his visit last year, dubbed “Operation Aurora” — federal agents appear to have detained far fewer people with clear ties to the gang. No criminal charges resulted from the DEA’s Jan. 26 raid, the agency later admitted. A subsequent operation led by ICE on Feb. 5 targeted “100+ members” of TdA in the Denver metro area, but agents told Fox News that out of 30 arrests made that day, only one detainee was suspected of TdA ties.
In addition to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, D.B.U. and R.M.M.’s attorneys are seeking a temporary restraining order prohibiting their “summary removal.”
“Numerous accounts, both in declarations and public news reporting, have raised serious questions about the validity of the government’s designations of people as ‘alien enemies,’ with no process provided for anyone to contest those designations,” they wrote. “A TRO is needed because there may not be sufficient time for this court to intervene before people are put on planes to remove petitioners from the United States.”
Sweeney ordered the Trump administration to respond to the motion for a TRO by Thursday, and scheduled a hearing on the motion for April 21. In the meantime, she issued an order that “prohibits the removal from this jurisdiction” of the defendants and similar detainees.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.


Pot laws in South Dakota
Voters in South Dakota rejected a recreational marijuana initiative in 2024, marking the second ballot box failure in a row for legalization.
Voters supported recreational and medical marijuana in 2020, but the state Supreme Court overturned the recreational piece for failure to adhere to the state’s single subject rule for Constitutional amendments.
Lawmakers in Pierre have since tightened restrictions to the voter-approved medical marijuana program. Among other changes, they’ve added provisions to state law to require a medical marijuana patient’s doctor to submit their patient’s name to the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.
In 2024, a group opposed to recreational marijuana called Protecting South Dakota Kids leaned in to the emerging misgivings in other states, listing stories of “marijuana victims” on its website and running ads connecting marijuana use with harder drugs like heroin and methamphetamine.


To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
‘Critical threat’ to medical marijuana falls as lawmakers consider nine cannabis bills

She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Medical marijuana industry pushes for rule changes and representation as cardholders decline

Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 14:40:28+00:00,CT Mirror,Expanding the federal child tax credit has some Republican support. Now what?,Marissa Martinez | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/federal-child-tax-credit-expansion/,"Many lawmakers want to expand the $2,000-per-child credit, a longtime Democratic priority — but aren’t sure about how to get there.","This story was originally reported by Marissa Martinez of The 19th.  Meet Marissa and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The push to expand the child tax credit is more bipartisan than ever — but a clear solution to stop it from being slashed in half is still far off.
Republicans and Democrats have been juggling proposals for the credit — currently a $2,000-per-child tax incentive — as Congress renegotiates the country’s tax structure. Lawmakers told The 19th they are anxious to pass something this year before the existing bill sunsets this fall and reverts the credit to a baseline $1,000.
“I hope not. We can’t afford to do that,” said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican who has been promoting expanding the credit to encompass more of the working class.
For years, the left has dominated the conversation around the child tax credit, which is claimed by more than 46 million taxpayers each year. Now, some Republicans believe they have ground to gain on populist issues, given the low-income voters they credit for winning control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.
Meanwhile, Democrats have been hammering their counterparts all year on what they view as Republicans’ hypocrisy in supporting an expanded credit as they give more tax cuts to billionaires at the expense of other social programs. 
“Glad they have big proposals, but without them actually delivering it, it’s all talk. At the same time when they’re cutting SNAP benefits, does that make sense?” said California Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax legislation. “Let’s not try to be too cute by half, saying that you’re fighting for working families but you’re hurting them on some other policies.”
During the pandemic, congressional Democrats and then-President Joe Biden temporarily increased the child tax credit to up to $3,600, expanded eligibility to more of the lowest-earning families and delivered monthly checks to recipients, rather than one lump sum. These changes lifted millions of households out of poverty. But the credit reverted back to $2,000 in 2022 — and child poverty rose soon after.
Last year, GOP senators and former Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Independent who used to caucus with Democrats, rejected a tax package that would have moderately increased the credit, part of legislation that had already passed the House with bipartisan support.
Now that lawmakers are closer to passing a budget framework, Congress can soon turn its attention to negotiating border security, energy credits and tax priorities. 
Some Republicans in both chambers are eager to expand the credit, including Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican. Current proposals range from Alabama Sen. Katie Britt’s idea to increase the similar Child and Dependent Care Credit to $4,000 to Hawley’s bill to increase the child tax credit to $5,000 and offset a parent’s payroll taxes.
“There’s real momentum behind it,” Hawley said. “The president wants to deliver tax relief to working people and he understands that we’ve got to put fresh tax relief for working people into this bill. It’s fine to renew the existing cuts, but that’s not going to do anything for working people.”
But this sentiment is still in the minority for the Republican Party, which is ideologically hesitant to spend more on increased credits. Trump and Vice President JD Vance said they wanted to expand it during the campaign, though they did not give details on paying for it. Expanding the child tax credit did not appear on the White House’s priority list earlier this year.
Meanwhile, a group of Democratic senators laid out ambitious plans for an expanded credit on Wednesday. The American Family Act would create a tiered system for the child tax credit based on age: $6,360 for newborns, $4,320 for children age 1 to 6, and $3,600 for children age 6 to 17. It would also be fully refundable, meaning someone can access the credit even if they don’t earn enough to owe income tax.
“We’ve got a strong coalition, but tax policy [under] this administration seems to be so anathema to what we’re trying to do, to the things that we’re fighting for,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of the bill’s sponsors. “I’m just very concerned. They want to give tax cuts to multi-millionaires, we want to give them to expecting moms. … There’s just different views on how we go about this and we’ll see what happens.”
The House and Senate have been tied up in finalizing the year’s budget after GOP holdouts stalled negotiations, and meaningful conversations on the credit and other tax legislation have been mostly surface-level, members of both parties said this week. But that hasn’t stopped Republicans from messaging on the issue — and trying to preemptively push Democrats into a corner for not getting on board with their legislation in its entirety. 
“REMINDER: If the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts are not extended, 40 MILLION families will see their Child Tax Credit cut in half,” the House GOP account posted on X Tuesday. “Passing the budget reconciliation bill would prevent the largest tax hike in American history.”
The reach tax credits have had for families is also shrinking. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and other high-profile lawmakers from past eras pressed current leadership earlier this month to expand and make permanent the current tax credit to keep up with inflation, adjusting it to at least $2,500.
Regardless, the Trump administration’s overall approach to economic issues has been unreliable, said Illinois Rep. Danny Davis, another Ways and Means Democrat. The “frenzy” makes it difficult to telegraph what’s next for the child tax credit and other tax priorities once the budget issues are settled, he added.
“Some of their notions, thoughts and ideas are awfully ridiculous and off-the-chart. But I do think they respond to pressure, and the pressure the American people are putting on them causes them to go back-and-forth,” Davis said. “That’s not the best way to run an airplane, that’s not the best way to run a government.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0717_ChildCareStory-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 11:13:25.329018

(Photo courtesy of the Law Offices of the Public Defender)Philip Larragoite, chief of staff for the New Mexico Legislature’s Senate Judiciary Committee, says his measure of a legislative session’s success isn’t so much the bills lawmakers passed but, rather, the ones they did not.
“You can’t hear ‘em all, and the Judiciary Committee in the Senate was pretty rigorous about what it hears and what it acts on,” Larragoite told the state Public Defender Commission on Friday during its regular meeting in Albuquerque — its first since the session ended on March 22. “Our Constitution is hard-wired — it’s supposed to be hard to adopt legislation, hard to pass bills.”
The commission oversees the Law Offices of the Public Defender, the independent state agency that employs public defenders who represent anyone charged with a crime in New Mexico.
Larragoite, who is also LOPD’s deputy chief of policy and statewide offices, noted that he has participated in more than 70 legislative sessions, the earliest in 1961 as a page for Jack Campbell, who was House Speaker at the time.
Appellate Defender Kim Chavez Cook, who also works as LOPD’s policy advocate during legislation sessions, agreed that it is important to note the bills that did not pass.
She highlighted two examples of bills that were “priorities for us to stop”: House Bill 204, a proposal that comes up every year to try to remove defense pre-trial interviews from certain cases; and House Bill 190, which would have given alleged victims in criminal cases the right to be a litigant in those cases.
Chavez Cook said LOPD had “serious due process concerns” with HB204, and put a lot of time and energy into discussions about it. HB190 raised “some serious separation of powers and other related concerns,” she said. Neither bill received a single vote in committee this year.
“We’ll keep doing that year after year, many of these things will come back again,” Chavez Cook said.
No new public defender jobs in budget
Policy aside, Chief Public Defender Bennet Baur told the Commission on Friday he was disappointed by the budget outcomes. During the recent session, his agency asked lawmakers for a nearly 13% increase in its annual budget but only received a 4.1% increase.
Lawmakers did not give LOPD any money for additional full-time staff positions, Baur said, but they did give the agency $450,000 to spend over the next two years for recruitment and retention.
Hundreds of additional public defenders would be needed to properly handle all of the cases coming through the state’s criminal legal system, and there is a longstanding disparity of resources between public defenders and their opponents in court, district attorneys.
The American Bar Association found in 2022 that New Mexico needs at least 602 full-time attorneys and is currently only meeting 33% of clients who need a legal defense.
Baur said many lawmakers were concerned about the economy in the U.S. and the state as they considered the budget, and are probably even more concerned about it now than they were during the session.
In the last four years, he said, lawmakers have funded 54 new staff positions. LOPD has an overall vacancy rate of 11%, better than most state agencies, he said. That rate is higher for attorney positions, at 16.8%, he said.
Many public defenders aren’t actually full-time staff employed by LOPD, but are contractors who are paid a flat fee for taking on cases rather than an hourly rate.
For example, when a contractor takes on a first-degree murder case, the state pays them a base rate of $5,400. For the whole case. That means, on average, that attorney is making $13.81 per hour representing their client, according to the ABA’s study.
In some jurisdictions, paying a public defender a flat fee is outlawed, said Commissioner Jacqueline Flores, a former Second Judicial District Court judge.
Baur said lawmakers didn’t give LOPD money to launch a pilot project for paying contract attorneys an hourly rate. But he said he’s determined to still try to do it by “rearranging money” within the agency’s existing budget.
“Those of you that know the budget process know that you never get what you ask for,” Baur said. “But if you don’t ask for it, then you don’t get it.”

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)The Montana Legislature last week approved a bill to boost private community solar projects across the state. 
Shared solar projects are gaining momentum across the country with more than 44 states offering similar programs, according to Sen. Chris Pope, and in Montana through nine of the state’s rural electric cooperatives.
Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, introduced Senate Bill 188, laying out requirements for shared solar projects and how they will connect with the state’s public utilities.
Shared solar projects allow individuals who cannot put solar panels on their own property or business to invest in, and benefit from, solar energy.
Community solar projects are “a small but meaningful part of an all-of-the-above energy approach that’s embraced by our governor and frankly, which is needed, as we know in this committee and in Senate Energy, it’s needed by Montana’s quickly growing electric grid,” Pope told the House Energy, Technology, and Federal Relations Committee on March 24. 
The bill creates a framework for developers to build a solar facility that generates between 50 kilowatts and five megawatts and sell the generated electricity to subscribers located within the service area. Subscribers would receive a monthly bill credit proportional to their share of the project. 
The bill passed both chambers with overwhelming bipartisan support, including a final 46-4 vote in the Senate during the weekend. 
In both the Senate and House committee hearings, more than a dozen groups and individuals testified in support of the legislation, while NorthWestern Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities, Montanan’s largest utilities, opposed the bill. 
SB 188 opens up community solar to individuals who are unable to tap into the solar market otherwise, proponents said, such as those who rent their homes or live in apartment complexes. It also expands opportunities for those who develop solar arrays, including public-private partnerships, individuals such as farmers and ranchers, and can make use of underdeveloped property. 
“These programs provide energy cost savings for households and businesses without needing to install the system on site,” Matthew Hargarten, vice president of government and public affairs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access, said during the house committee hearing. His organization represents more than 130 businesses nationwide that have invested in more than 2,000 shared solar projects. 
“The reality is there’s a lot of research and numerous cost-benefit analyses from around the country that smaller projects bring benefits to the entire electric grid and stabilize long-term cost for all ratepayers,” he said. 
However, Alan Olson, director of government affairs for Northwestern Energy, said he didn’t believe the bill offered a “happy outlook.” 
He, and the representatives of Montana-Dakota Utilities, stated they’d prefer shared solar projects operate as qualifying facilities — an existing program for small-scale generators to use the utility-scale infrastructure. Those projects are regulated by the Public Service Commission.
Olson also brought up concerns over the administrative cost burden utilities would have to bear by keeping track of community solar subscribers; but a House amendment to the bill shifted that responsibility onto the shared solar facility owners. 
Justin Pearce, CEO of A-Team Roofing & Solar in Billings, said the bill would be an economic boon to Montana. 
His veteran-owned company employs 27 people just in their solar department, a number he expects will grow to more than 50 by the end of the year. 
“You might not know this, but Billings has 285, what they call, sun days a year. Phoenix, Arizona, only has 283,” Pearce said. “Energy production in Montana is really good in the solar world. I feel this is one more piece of energy dominance for the state of Montana. So jobs, jobs, jobs.”
Senate Bill 188 was also supported by more than a dozen groups including the Montana Farmers Union, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Blackfeet Nation, Fort Belknap Indian Community, the Chippewa Cree Tribe of Rocky Boy’s, and the Montana Environmental Information Center,
“This is a happy bill,” Pope told the house committee. “And everyone benefits.”
Fifty-four representatives supported SB 188 on third reading in the House and all but four Senators supported the bill in its final Senate vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1323983992-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 11:13:25.329018

From security cameras to facial recognition systems, these devices are typically advertised as critical measures to prevent violence, bullying, and other threats. However, in diverse urban areas, the increased focus on threats from students results in greater monitoring of students, which leads to more disciplinary actions that unfairly affect students of color. 
Tools like security cameras, biometric surveillance, and AI-based behavior monitoring are commonly defended as essential for controlling “chaotic” school settings, yet they also contribute to the criminalization of students who are already viewed as threats because of racial prejudice. In contrast, suburban-white district school resource officers (SROs), who highlight external dangers like school shooters, frequently promote surveillance tactics centered on perimeter security, strengthening the belief that their students require protection rather than oversight.
These misguided efforts to enhance school safety have led to the extensive use of surveillance technology. These actions do not occur in isolation. Enhanced surveillance exacerbates existing racial biases in school discipline, especially by focusing on certain students for heightened scrutiny and penalties. RACCE’S position, informed by student organizing, on school safety is simple. True school safety comes from fully funded, culturally responsive programming and curriculum, not security measures. School safety is our priority. We don’t believe armed or unarmed security guards, SROs, or the use of surveillance technologies guarantee student or staff safety. 
Currently our state legislature is advancing several bills that either ignore science and data on how best to achieve school safety or climate (SB 1374); omit guidelines or a governance mechanism on the use of artificial intelligence in our k-12 schools as surveillance instruments (SB 2);  and a bill that doesn’t close a giant compliance loophole so that all school districts that have SROs adhere to new or current state statute unless there is an updated or new memorandum of understanding put in place by local boards of education (HB 7217). 
For instance, we believe HB 7217 must include provisions that SROs be trained prior to them being placed in schools and meet continuing education credits that ensure they don’t implicitly or explicitly harm student learning while carrying out their duties. Nor do any of these bills explicitly address guidance, compliance or training for SROs or security guards to the Trust Act.  While we support some of the ideas in these bills, we will not support half measures and neither should our elected officials. 
School surveillance disproportionately affects children from vulnerable backgrounds. ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection device, criminalizes underprivileged communities, particularly those with a substantial number of students of color. In Chicago, where ShotSpotter is frequently used, studies show that “more than 90% of alerts lead police to find no evidence to corroborate gunfire.” When a city or school district chooses to use these types of surveillance they also choose to  perpetuate the idea that particular residents of neighborhoods or students at these schools are intrinsically criminal, producing an unfounded sense of danger. 
Surveillance in schools frequently results in increased police presence, which disproportionately affects students who are already heavily policed in their communities. As an example, “gang databases,” which are used to track children suspected of criminal involvement, contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline, where Black and Latino students are arrested at higher rates for minor offenses. What begins as an effort to ensure safe schools rapidly turns into an intrusive monitoring system that sees children as criminals rather than individuals in need of assistance and education.
Surveillance in schools is rationalized as a measure for increasing safety, but actually undermines confidence and produces a fearful environment rather than one of safety. The widespread installation of machines at school entrances that use Artificial Intelligence or biometrics, such as those by Evolv and Opengate, aims to prevent gun violence, but “there is little evidence to prove that any of these companies’ claims are true.”  These gadgets use artificial intelligence to detect concealed weapons, but they frequently trigger false alarms and increase police presence. Some schools use facial recognition technology, but research indicates that such systems can have costly and detrimental repercussions. According to the Advancement Project, constant surveillance produces a climate in which students feel watched, which “prevents young people from fully being able to express themselves.”
In many schools SROs contribute to the erosion of trust. SROs have the same powers as street cops, including the authority to arrest and detain kids, which escalates problems that would otherwise be handled by school personnel. According to the ACLU, “police in schools harm Black students and other students of color,” particularly when combined with monitoring technology. SROs also conduct “threat assessments,” which can be distressing for pupils because they are frequently labeled as potential threats rather than offered assistance. 
This method not only generates fear but also highlights the larger problem of law enforcement perceiving at-risk students as dangers instead of as individuals requiring assistance. Rather than promoting a supportive atmosphere for care and intervention, these evaluations enhance existing biases, unfairly focusing on students from marginalized groups and perpetuating cycles of punishment instead of creating avenues for success. 
Digital monitoring software is also becoming more widely used in schools: “89% of teachers surveyed used software to track students’ activity,” with the goal of identifying disciplinary breaches. These methods raise grave privacy concerns, particularly when students or parents are not aware of the type or scope of ongoing surveillance. Some schools even provide kids with equipment to monitor their activities at home. Following monitoring alarms, schools dispatched police officers to conduct “wellness checks” at students’ homes. These actions blur the distinction between education and law enforcement, further undermining trust.
While supporters of monitoring say that it is important to maintain order, research shows that it does not address the underlying reasons of violence or misbehavior. Instead of establishing a nurturing environment, surveillance technologies turn schools into places of constant observation, where children are seen as threats first and students second. According to the Advancement Project, focusing on monitoring technologies diverts attention away from more serious issues including poverty, inadequate mental health care, and a lack of resources. 
True school safety is achieved not by surveillance, but through comprehensive, community-driven solutions to the underlying challenges.
We also believe student rights are being sacrificed while there is little to no evidence that supports the continued or increased use of a multitude of technologies being placed or piloted in our schools. Therefore we are calling for a statewide moratorium on new surveillance technologies inside schools until our state department of education, through action taken by our state legislature, can establish clear and robust guidelines on what types of surveillance technologies are allowed in schools in Connecticut. 
We call for this with a loud warning that an increase in school surveillance is not a neutral development; rather, it represents a shift toward a society in which privacy is surrendered for the illusion of safety. The rising use of surveillance technologies in schools, such as ShotSpotter, facial recognition, biometrics and AI weapons detection systems, contributes to a culture of suspicion, inequity, and criminality. 
Rather than encouraging a learning environment, they create an atmosphere of constant surveillance in which pupils are treated as suspects rather than individuals with the right to privacy and autonomy. 
If we wish to protect our youth, we must cease using policing and surveillance as a solution. We must strengthen our focus on developing schools that promote students’ well-being, mental health, and emotional development. Only then will we see a real, lasting change in the efforts to keep schools safe.

CHICAGO — On a still-warm early fall morning in September 2019, federal agents walked into the Illinois Capitol building in Springfield and left with boxes of evidence collected from the legislative office of then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago. Roughly 200 miles north, more agents executed search warrants on Sandoval’s home on Chicago’s Southwest Side and his district office in the nearby suburb of Cicero.

But before word of the public raids made the rounds on social media and into early news reports, Sandoval’s colleague, State Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, got a knock on his door at his home on the South Side of Chicago. At first, someone who identified himself as Jones’ cousin told the two FBI agents that the senator wasn’t home — but a little while later recanted the lie and invited them back in from their car.

“How you all doing?” Jones asked the agents, to which FBI Special Agent Timothy O’Brien responded, “Good, good good. How are you?”

“Well, the FBI is at my door, so,” Jones replied with a small laugh.

Nearly six years later, O’Brien took the witness stand Monday afternoon in a Chicago federal courtroom with Jones about 30 feet away flanked by defense attorneys as the lawmaker’s corruption trial nears its end. In the final 20 minutes of testimony before the jury was sent home for the day, prosecutors played the first few moments of the secretly recorded interview with Jones.

The pair of agents can be heard in the 2019 recording telling Jones that they were investigating Sandoval and wanted to ask him some questions. But they didn’t tell Jones that he was also a target of their widespread probe.

When Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri asked O’Brien on Monday why he didn’t tell Jones that information, the agent said that if he’d come right out and said it, there was a “potential that he would not speak with us.”

“And did he ask you whether he was under investigation?” Kolluri asked.

“He did not,” O’Brien said.

Jurors will hear the remainder of the roughly 40-minute interview on Tuesday, during which prosecutors allege Jones lied to O’Brien and his partner — the basis for one of the three charges Jones faces.

The feds also allege Jones agreed to accept bribes from red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-FBI cooperator Omar Maani in exchange for changing a piece of legislation he’d proposed in early 2019 that Maani worried could harm his industry.

Prosecutors say it doesn’t matter that Jones never received the $5,000 from Maani, nor did he ever narrow the legislation in the way that Maani asked for. The only agreement that did come to fruition was a job — or at least several weeks’ worth of payments from Maani — for Jones’ former intern, Christopher Katz.

The jury last week heard Maani quantify the number of people he made secret recordings of as “dozens and dozens and dozens” in the roughly 20 months he was an undercover FBI cooperator beginning in January 2018 until the public raids on Sandoval and others on Sept. 24, 2019.

FBI Special Agent Kelly Shanahan on Monday reiterated that Sandoval was one of the public officials Maani helped the government to charge; the senator pleaded guilty in early 2020 after he began cooperating with the feds’ ongoing investigation. In fact, Shanahan felt moved to “pay my respects” at Sandoval’s funeral after he died in December 2020 from COVID-19 complications. At the time, Shanahan had been working with Sandoval for about a year and said that while she and the two IRS agents who attended the funeral weren’t invited, the late senator’s wife and daughters thanked her for coming.

But Shanahan also revealed Monday that the FBI gave Maani about $75,000 to give to Sandoval during the course of Maani’s cooperation. While Maani had been giving Sandoval perks like cigars and meals for years before the feds approached him, he began giving Sandoval cash after January 2018.

The bribes were meant to buy Sandoval’s continued protection of the red-light camera industry as the chair of the Illinois Senate Transportation Committee. But they were also an exchange for the senator’s help intervening when the Illinois Department of Transportation opposed the approval of red-light camera installations proposed by certain suburbs.

At a June 2019 dinner meant to facilitate a relationship between Maani and Jones, Sandoval demonstrated his own close friendship with Maani, inviting Jones into the circle.

“I’m glad you came, Emil,” Sandoval said. “Omar wants to be your friend.”

After Jones left the Oak Brook steakhouse that night, Maani gave Sandoval his latest installment of cash, which had been in his pocket throughout the hourslong dinner.

Jones didn’t catch the FBI’s attention until March 2019 — more than a year into Maani’s cooperation with the government, after Maani brought up Jones’ newly proposed legislation to Sandoval, who apparently suggested brokering a meeting. Shanahan on Friday said that the FBI “found it interesting” that Jones, “who had filed legislation on red-light cameras,” would be willing to meet with Maani, a co-owner of a red-light camera company.

Maani’s cooperation also helped the feds nab a handful of other public officials who accepted bribes, including mayors of small suburbs just southwest of Chicago who were convinced to pursue red-light cameras from Maani’s company, SafeSpeed.

According to Shanahan, some of those mayors also accepted both cash and other gifts from Maani.

Jones’ defense lawyers jumped on the disparity between what those officials asked for and received versus Jones’ experience with Maani. Attorney Vic Henderson asked Shanahan whether Jones got “any cigars” or “Any tickets to events? Any flights to faraway places?”

“No,” Shanahan said to all three.

“He got a steak, correct?” Henderson asked.

“Yes,” Shanahan said.

“And he got a lemonade,” Henderson stated.

“I believe that’s what he had,” Shanahan replied.

Henderson also asked Shanahan why the FBI didn’t give Maani cash to try to entice Jones at the June dinner, to which Shanahan replied that she didn’t “believe there would’ve been a basis to do that.”

“This was the first time Omar was having dinner with him,” she said of Jones.

“So you didn’t believe he would’ve taken any money in June?” Henderson asked.

“I don’t know that,” Shanahan said. “It was a first meeting.”

But a few weeks later in July 2019, as Maani treated Jones to dinner at the senator’s favorite steakhouse, money did come up as Maani pushed Jones to name a dollar amount that he could contribute to an upcoming campaign fundraiser. After a few minutes of demurring — and chewing his wagyu beef filet — Jones finally acquiesced.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said.

“Done,” Maani replied.

“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

It turned out that the intern, Christopher Katz, hadn’t worked for Jones for a year at that point. Prosecutors on Friday showed the jury late-night texts between the two, with Jones asking Katz — more than 15 years his junior — “I want to see u after” Katz was finished at a strip club.

Jones’ attorney Vic Henderson on Monday pushed Shanahan to agree with his contention that the case was “not about a relationship between the senator and Chris,” but was quickly admonished by U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood to move from an argumentative stance and to just “ask questions to get evidence.”

Maani quickly agreed to hire Katz — and the details were hammered out during yet another dinner between Jones and Maani in August 2019. It was then that Maani told Jones that he didn’t want to raise any suspicions within SafeSpeed about someone connected to Jones getting hired at the company, given Jones’ documented history as not being friendly to the red-light camera industry.

Instead, Maani said he’d hire Katz directly. In a phone call a few days later, Maani told Jones that he didn’t have any work for Katz right away but would put him on his payroll anyway.

“I just wanted to make sure that he’s the type of kid that, you know, when he gets a check and he’s not doing anything right away, that he’s, you know, he’s not gonna be spooked by that,” Maani said on the wiretapped call. “He’s not gonna be weird and stuff. … Is he — would he be cool with that for a while? I mean, does he get it? Does he understand this?”

“Yeah, but um, make sure we find him some work,” Jones replied.

But Maani never gave Katz any assignments. The two never even met before Maani abruptly stopped paying Katz after the investigation went public on Sept. 24, 2019, after the raids on Sandoval and other suburban officials.

In all, Katz collected $1,800 total from six weekly payments, which he testified last week helped him pay for school at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

(Photo by Getty Images)A state-licensed EMT from Indianola is facing two felony charges of grooming minors to commit an unlawful act of a sexual nature.
Police allege that in October 2024, 37-year-old Jeremy Dean McCormick of Indianola took a 15-year-old female and a 16-year-old female on a shopping trip to eastern Iowa. He allegedly took the two teens to a Victoria’s Secret store, where he purchased underwear for both of the girls.
Prior to that incident, police say, one of the two teens had previously gone to a Victoria’s Secret store with McCormick where he purchased underwear for her. According to police, the girl alleged McCormick knew she was a minor and that after both shopping trips, he asked her to send him photos of her in the underwear he had purchased for her.
McCormick has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of grooming. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2025.
Separately, the Iowa Bureau of Emergency Medical and Trauma Services has issued an emergency order suspending McCormick’s EMT license, citing his arrest. The board alleges his “continued practice of emergency medical services constitutes an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare.”

Before adjourning for Spring Recess last week, the state Senate and Assembly appropriations committees moved a total of 115 bills onto their “suspense files.” What follows is a rather opaque process that could end with roughly a third of those bills killed — away from public view and with little to no debate.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, any bill estimated to cost at least $50,000 gets placed on the suspense file. Next month, and again in August, the appropriations committees will either move the bills off of “suspense” so they can advance through the Legislature, or hold them — essentially killing those measures for the session.
Last summer the committees nixed about a third of the 830 bills on suspense. The process can be fast-paced, and with few votes recorded it can be difficult for both the public and even lawmakers who authored the measures, to know why bills were spiked.

Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat whose child tax credit bill died last year in the suspense file: “The way we treat the appropriations process is a non-democratic process; I believe that it’s a corrupt process.”

That same summer, other lawmakers and advocates accused Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration of inflating the cost estimates of health care bills in order to block them by way of the suspense process. A spokesperson for the administration said the claim was “outrageous and inaccurate.”
Lorena Gonzalez, a former chairperson of the Assembly Appropriations Committee and current president of the California Labor Federation, does not consider the suspense file process to be secretive, however. She said anyone can review the committees’ fiscal analyses and comment.
The bills placed on suspense last week included measures that would allow homeless students to live out of their cars; require food sold in prison vending machines be priced at market retail price; and create the California Latino Commission.

Conflict of interest?

California’s lieutenant governor and 2026 gubernatorial hopeful Eleni Kounalakis has real estate holdings that netted her hundreds of thousands of dollars last year. Though she isn’t prohibited from making money off these properties, the earnings could potentially cause a conflict of interest if she wins her bid for California’s highest office, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In addition to owning a stake in grazing land, solar fields and properties across Northern California and the Central Valley, Kounalakis receives income from three buildings around the state Capitol where interest groups, lobbyists and others with business in state government hold their operations.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Kounalakis’ campaign said if she is elected governor, she will place “any assets that may present a conflict of interest into a blind trust.”
But John Pelissero, the director of government ethics at Santa Clara University, said Kounalakis would have been well-advised to distance herself from these assets as lieutenant governor.

Pelissero: “If she’s benefiting financially from lobbying, then the optics of it are troubling. It would be reasonable for any member of the public to look at that and say, ‘That’s odd.’”

Newsom allocates money to wildfire prevention

Three months after deadly wildfires swept through Los Angeles County and killed 30 people, Gov. Newsom signed legislation Monday to provide more than $170 million in state funding to help prevent wildfires, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
The money comes from Proposition 4, a $10 billion bond measure voters approved in November. Six conservancies operating under the governor’s Resources Agency will receive the money to manage vegetation removal and forest thinning around their regions. At least half of the money will go to conservancies in Southern California, while a third will go to conservancies in the Sierra Nevada.
The governor also issued an executive order Monday that enables projects funded from the new legislation to benefit from a March emergency proclamation. The proclamation put a temporary statewide pause on certain provisions of two key California environmental laws to speed up wildfire prevention efforts. Some environmental groups have criticized the order.

Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity: “This funding doubles down on forest destruction rather than investing in real wildfire safety measures like home hardening in communities.”

Nearly half a year into into the dispute, eight striking Kaiser mental health workers wrapped up a hunger strike as broken-off negotiations  were set to resume. 


Nearly six months into their labor union dispute against Southern California Kaiser Permanente, eight mental health care workers banded together last week in an organized five-day hunger strike to highlight their cause.
“Kaiser’s trying to starve us out, that’s clear — so, give them what they want,” said Adriana Webb, a member of the National Union of Healthcare Workers who chose to subsist solely on water and electrolytes from Monday morning through Friday evening. “I feel hungry for equity. I feel hungry for change. How is this any different?”
Now engaged in the longest mental health strike in U.S. history, the Southern California workers have been seeking a new union contract that would include:

more mandated time between therapy sessions for patient follow up
restoration of pension benefits that were removed from new employee contracts in 2015
cost-of-living wage adjustments

After a long list of Democratic members of the state Assembly and Senate wrote Kaiser in December urging it to accept the union’s “reasonable contract proposals” — and after Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Feb. 6 written request for both sides “to prioritize the common good that have allowed Californians to rise above our difficulties and resolve our differences” — state Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly and former Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg have agreed to mediate.
Kaiser executives threw their hands up and walked out of mediation talks on March 11 when the union continued pressing  its three major contract issues. Today bargaining talks are scheduled to resume.
Steinberg mediated a similar open-ended strike for Northern California Kaiser mental health care workers in 2022, which lasted 10 weeks and resulted in Kaiser meeting most of the union’s demands.
“We know Kaiser can provide all these things if they wanted to,” said Webb, a medical social worker in the infectious disease unit who stood on the picket line in front of Kaiser’s Los Angeles Medical Center on Sunset Boulevard. “They already provide it to our Northern California counterparts, and all we’re asking for is the same thing. Kaiser still can’t explain why we deserve less or our patients deserve less.”
In a written response to CalMatters questions, Kaiser Permanente spokesperson Terry Kanakri discussed Kaiser’s overall commitment to work with more than 40 unions that represent 80% of its employees.
“Every one of the 80 contracts is different, and each reflects the differences in operational needs, local market economics and wages, professional classifications of the employees in each local, and a host of other factors,” said Kanakri.
“Our goal is and has always been to reach an agreement that makes Kaiser Permanente the best place to give and receive care. We have made — and repeatedly improved — our proposals during bargaining in an effort to reach an agreement. However, in nearly nine months of bargaining, NUHW has made very little movement on the key bargaining issues.”

Although not aware of any specific details of the 2022 NorCal strike or the current SoCal strikes, University of Southern California professor of healthcare finances and economics Glenn Melnick gave his overview on today’s health care labor climate.
“Northern California has the highest wage index in the country,” he said. “I think it’s 20 points higher than L.A. — maybe 25%. So there’s economic reasons why there’s differences. An economist would say, ‘Mental health care worker, you want these benefits? Move to San Francisco.’
“And many employers are cutting back pension benefits these days. Ten or 15 years ago, pension benefits were much more generous across the board. Kaiser could easily afford to give them these benefits and not think twice, but it’s bigger than just these workers. It’s the ripple effect, right?”
Melnick also speculated that health care workers’ negotiating power has waned as the COVID pandemic, which drove demand for their services, has somewhat subsided.

From April 8 through 12, the hunger strikers spent eight-hour days alongside their picketing fellow union members and each night together fasting at a West Hollywood church. Sleeping in a community space barely big enough for eight air mattresses huddled beside the piano against a back wall, they shared a bathroom and took turns showering in a motel room next door.
Medically cleared beforehand, they received daily wellness checks from volunteer union nurses.
“Right now, I feel like I could go another month,” said Zhane Sandoval, propped up on an elbow from their mattress on the morning of April 11, day four of the hunger strike. “So test me, Kaiser!
“Kaiser says that it’s a union employer, but all we’re seeing is union busting. All we’re seeing is separation, trying to divide. But their efforts just lead us to unite.”
Union organizer Rachel Forgash, who stayed overnight with the hunger strikers at the church, expressed frustration over the protracted standoff.
“Kaiser has exceeded all of our expectations in their unwillingness to bargain in good faith and drag this out as long as possible,” she said. “In Southern California, they’re about to start bargaining with the Alliance, which is a huge group of unions at Kaiser, and I think they’re afraid that — when we win — it’s going to set a precedent for other unions to fight just as hard.”

Aida Valvidia, a psychiatric social worker at Kaiser’s Sylmar facility, and Melissa Chavez, a medical social worker at Riverside, both started working for Kaiser before the 2015 contract negotiations reached a settlement, so they each have pension benefits that 70% of their fellow mental health care union members do not. Yet both chose to participate in the hunger strike.
“For the people who don’t have pensions, I think it’s unfair,” said Valvidia. “Why do I have a pension and you don’t? Because you started later? That makes no sense to me. We’re equals.”
Chavez and her husband have been on strike together since Oct. 21. “Kaiser members deserve equity and access to timely quality care,” she said. “Workers are experiencing high caseloads, inadequate and unsafe staffing, lack of time, lack of tools.”
The hunger strike week started with iconic labor leader and activist Dolores Huerta visiting the picketers on April 8, two days before her 95th birthday. “I know that you’re not just doing this on your own behalf,” said Huerta, surrounded by cheering union members in their red union T-shirts. “You’re actually doing this on behalf of all the patients at Kaiser that are not getting the mental health services that they deserve.”
The union cites a recent 88-page report from the state Department of Managed Health Care, which notes that Kaiser’s failures to remedy 19 of the 20 violations in 2022 led to $200 million in state fines. The union has also filed its own complaints alleging Kaiser mismanages patient triage and appointment scheduling, by hiring unlicensed clerical staff and using algorithmic programming.

“Despite the persistent efforts of NUHW to mislead the public, the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) has not identified new deficiencies in our mental health care,” said Kanakri’s statement. It went on to say that Kaiser met with the state department “last week in our first quarterly review and demonstrated the extraordinary progress we have made on all the deficiencies outlined in the Corrective Action Work Plan.”
“We’re in disbelief,” said hunger striker Nick Nunez, a therapist in Kaiser’s Virtual Medical Center, which lends support to any patients in need across Southern California. “They take out ads in the paper saying everything’s fine — that they’re providing adequate care to their patients and everything is top-notch. It’s so bizarre and unbelievable.”
Andrew Kane worked as an associate clinical social worker at the Los Angeles Medical Center he now pickets and fasted at. “It’s a little odd, a little surreal,” he said, noting that he happened to see a patient in the world outside of Kaiser. “Fortunately — or unfortunately — he didn’t notice me, so we didn’t have to have that interaction.”
Kane started in June 2024, so he’s been on strike longer than he’s received a Kaiser salary.
As the strike persisted without end in sight since October, many workers have returned to Kaiser due to financial concerns. But some communicate the problems they see internally while back at work. 
“They’re actually the ones documenting all the things going wrong,” said hunger striker Kassaundra Gutierrez-Thompson, a psychiatric social worker in Kaiser’s ADAPT virtual online treatment program. “We have DMHC investigators talking to a lot of our returned back staff. Unfortunately, a lot of our managers are combatting them.
“And so, a lot of our members are kind of scared, having to advocate for our patients.They’re fighting a different kind of battle inside.”
Rage Against the Machine guitarist and political labor activist Tom Morello joined the Kaiser picketers on April 9 to perform a short acoustic set, and U.S. Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo visited the strikers April 11.
Hours later, they broke their fast with religious leaders passing around a ceremonial bread loaf.“We can’t just be treated like numbers,” said hunger striker Ana Vargas Garcia, who also saw members remotely through the ADAPT program. “Patients can’t be treated like numbers. There’s real lives behind everyone that we see, behind every worker at Kaiser. That’s a big part of why we’re doing this.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/031025_Kaiser-HungerStrike_JH_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-15 09:04:32.885831

The new provision is tacked onto Senate Bill 150, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby, which originally established a fund to reimburse tuition and book fees for students in community colleges and technical schools. It passed the Senate last month.
A substitute version of the bill adopted Monday by the House Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee consolidates six smaller education bills, including provisions ranging from expanded financial aid opportunities to increased requirements for universities to accept transfer credit.
Among these consolidated bills is one sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melanie Stinnett if Springfield which would remove statutes that grant the University of Missouri and other UM System campuses exclusive license to offer certain doctoral degree programs.
The UM System is the only public university system permitted to grant research doctorate and professional degrees. Other state universities are allowed to partner with the UM System to offer similar degree programs but cannot do so independently.
The amended version of the bill passed Monday out of committee would repeal this provision, specifically to allow Missouri State University to offer programs that compete with those on UM System campuses.
Proponents of the bill say that the exclusivity granted to UM System campuses makes doctoral degrees less accessible to those who do not live near a campus.
“When I look at that, if that is a space that someone is interested in, we really shouldn’t be limiting that for people just because they can’t travel to a specific area of the state,” Stinnett said in a committee hearing last month.
Missouri State University President Richard Williams testified last month that his university simply seeks more flexibility. Missouri State currently offers 10 doctorate programs but is required by state law to do so in partnership with UM System campuses.
“This is relieving restrictions so we can be nimble,” he said.
Opponents to ending UM System’s exclusive power include the University of Missouri Flagship Council, which said in February in a Missourian guest commentary that tuition increases would likely follow as a result.
“The bottom line is that starting doctoral programs at public universities without research funding will need to be propped up with significant state support,” Chuck Brazeale, chair of the Flagship Council’s board of directors, wrote.
The bill passed through the House committee Monday by a vote of 10 to 1, with only state Rep. Bill Allen, a Republican from Kansas City, dissenting.

Jason Ward is co-director of the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness. He is also an economist at RAND and a professor of policy analysis at Pardee RAND Graduate School.


The spiraling cost of housing in California has affected virtually every facet of life. 
California has the nation’s largest unsheltered homeless population and among the highest rates of cost-burdened renters and overcrowded homes.
One reason for the seemingly endless upward trajectory of rents is how expensive it is to build new apartments in California. Those costs are a major contributor to “break-even rents,” or what must be charged for a project to be financially feasible. 
I recently led a study that compared total apartment development costs in California to those in Colorado and Texas. The average apartment in Texas costs roughly $150,000 to produce; in California, building the same apartment costs around $430,000, or 2.8 times more. Colorado occupies a middle ground, with an average cost of around $240,000 per unit.
For publicly subsidized, affordable apartments — a sector that California has spent billions on in recent years — the gap is even worse. These cost over four times as much as affordable apartment units do in Colorado and Texas.
There’s no single factor driving these huge differences. Land costs in California are over three times the Texas average. “Hard costs,” or those related to improving the land and constructing buildings, are 2.2 times those in Texas. California’s “soft costs,” which include financing, architectural and engineering fees, and development fees charged by local governments, are 3.8 times the Texas average. 
There are some unavoidable California-specific costs, like ensuring buildings are resilient to shaking from earthquakes. But the truly lifesaving seismic requirements explain only around 6% of hard-cost differences, the study estimated. The state’s strict energy efficiency requirements add around 7%.
California’s high cost of living may drive up the price of labor, but we found that construction wage differences explain only 6% to 10% of hard cost differences for market-rate apartments. However, for publicly subsidized apartment projects, which are often mandated to pay union-level wages, labor expenses explain as much as 20% to 35% of the total difference in costs between California and Texas. 
“Soft costs” in California are a major culprit. California property developers pay remarkably high fees for architectural and engineering services — triple the average cost in Texas. It’s five times as much or more if you’re building publicly funded, affordable apartments in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas. 
Seismic engineering requirements play a role. The bigger factor are complex and burdensome design requirements for affordable housing. These are dictated by state and local funding sources, and have little to do with habitability or safety but contribute substantially to these astonishing differences. 
Development fees to local governments make up the largest soft-cost difference in California. Such fees, which were the subject of a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court case, average around $30,000 per unit. In Texas, the average is about $800. (Again, Colorado occupies a middle ground at around $12,000.) 
In San Diego, for example, these fees on average eat up 14% of total development costs per apartment.
But the biggest thing driving up California apartment costs? Time. 
A privately financed apartment building that takes just over two years to produce from start to finish in Texas would take over four years in California. It takes twice as long to gain project approvals and the construction timeline is 1.5 times longer. 
That means land costs must be carried for longer, equipment and labor are on jobsites longer, and that loans are taken out for a longer term, and so on. 
Most of the differences that the study uncovered stem from policy choices made by state and local governments. Many are legacies of the so-called “slow growth movement” in California, which has shaped housing production since the 1980s. 
Those efforts worked. Population growth in the state went negative for a few years after 2020, due primarily to the high cost of housing. Even more recently, California’s growth was half the numbers seen in Texas and Florida, with younger and higher earners disproportionately leaving. 
These departures have dire implications for the state’s fiscal future and political influence nationally. California recently lost a congressional seat for the first time in its history. If current national population trends hold, it could lose four or five seats in 2030.
The California Legislature has become increasingly focused on reducing the cost of living, but meeting this goal requires substantial progress on lowering housing costs. New proposals to exempt urban infill housing production from state environmental law and a package of permitting reforms are steps in that direction. 
Will policymakers also take lessons from Texas and Colorado’s cheaper housing methods? That remains to be seen. But the future of California may well hinge on it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-15 09:04:32.885831

Too many grocery workers in our state work hard but struggle to get by. Whether buying groceries in the checkout line or running the register, they are being pushed to their limits.
Housing and food prices have soared in Minnesota, and for many, owning a home and being able to retire are out of reach. If something does not change soon, the way of life we all love here in Minnesota will disappear.
Grocery store jobs once provided decent, dignified lives.
Consider this: In 1982, the lowest wage for part-time grocery workers was $5.23 per hour, equivalent to approximately $17.58 in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. Forty-three years later, wages have not kept pace. Today, the lowest-paid part-time grocery workers make just over $11 an hour, a significant decline in real wages.
Meanwhile, housing and food prices have soared, trapping many in a cycle where each paycheck leaves workers short. Multiple jobs are now necessary just to get by.
“I work part-time at Cub to support my family. I don’t want my son to feel guilty watching mom eat less so he can eat more,” says Taylor Boos, who works at Cub. “Some nights, I only eat rice or some toast and a V8 to afford to keep my son well-nourished. I want to make enough to care for my loved ones at the job that I love.”
In a recent consumer survey run by UFCW 663, consumers flagged staffing shortages as a serious issue. And no wonder. Cub’s new staffing strategy is to buy out full-time workers and limit part-time employees to 15 hours per week. Grocery stores are running on skeleton crews. Products aren’t making it to shelves, and customers can’t find what they need. 
Right now, over 9,000 Twin Cities grocery workers are negotiating new contracts, with one goal: to turn grocery jobs into good jobs. Since the pandemic, grocers have been more profitable than they’ve been in a generation — yet instead of working with us to improve jobs, they want to shift health care costs onto workers, refuse to adequately fund the pension, and refuse to provide workers with raises and hours they need to thrive.  
“I work just under 40 hours a week. I need a tooth pulled, but I can’t afford to do that with the wages I’m making now,” says Duane Bluhm, who works at Kowalski’s Markets. “If my health care costs go up and my wages don’t make up for that, I won’t ever be able to get it addressed. My coworkers and I shouldn’t have to choose between our bills and seeing the doctor.”  
Sylvia O’Brien, a part-time Cub cashier, said that after her husband passed away, she had to plan her retirement herself. “Social security isn’t enough to rely on. I’m 70 now, but if I can get the hours that I need, I’ll be able to afford to retire when I’m 80,” she says. “I deserve to be able to retire someday, and I need to have a job that provides a path for a secure retirement.”
UFCW Local 663 members will fight as hard as necessary to settle a fair contract — to save the pension and win the hours and wages workers deserve.
Workers could go on strike this year if an agreement is not reached, and we urge customers to support good jobs in our communities.
America’s essential workers need to not just survive but live a dignified life.
Workers like Taylor, Duane and Sylvia deserve no less.
And the customers are with us.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-80284534-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 09:04:32.885831

A statewide survey of more than 3,400 educators conducted by the Maine Education Policy Research Institute (MEPRI) found that thousands of educators are overwhelmed by increasing disruptions in daily class activity and feel unprepared to manage it — despite that the state has invested in various programs and initiatives aimed at deterring such behavior. The problem, researchers told the Maine Legislature’s Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs on Monday, is that those efforts often lack coordination, technical assistance, and consistent implementation.
The result is exhausted educators, students with unaddressed behavioral needs and inefficient classrooms, the report found. 
“It’s really affecting the wellbeing of both students and staff,” Sarah Wilkinson, assistant professor of Special Education at the University of Southern Maine, told members of the Education Committee during the briefing Monday.
“And we know that if the learning environments are being disrupted and staff are frustrated and fatigued and reluctant, academic instruction is likely not happening at the level that we’d like to see.”
The report also mentioned the lack of state support to help districts adopt what’s known as an Integrated Multi-Tiered System of Supports (I-MTSS), which is a framework designed to identify and address students’ academic, behavioral, and emotional needs. Maine is currently the only state in the nation that does not offer technical assistance for districts using I-MTSS, according to the researchers.
Educators not equipped to handle worsening student behavior
Educators are spending valuable class time every day dealing with student behavior. Nearly all of the more than 3,400 educators that responded to the survey (96%) reported managing disruptive behavior during the 2023–2024 school year, with 77% dealing with it daily. More than half said they managed behavior crises — episodes involving severe or dangerous behavior — and nearly 20% of administrators reported handling such crises multiple times a day.
Educators reported spending up to 48 minutes on a single behavior crisis and losing hundreds of hours each school year managing various levels of behavioral issues, the report said. For some roles, this represents 20% of their annual work time.
General and special education teachers, educational technicians, and administrators also described burnout, emotional stress, physical injuries, and an increasing reluctance to stay in the profession as direct impacts of dealing with student behavior. 
Administrators who participated in focus groups also said that student behavior has become a top concern, especially in elementary grades, and is now one of the biggest challenges to recruiting and retaining staff. Some principals reported spending entire days managing individual students rather than providing academic leadership.
Educators also worry that unaddressed behavior problems could push more general education students into special education — further straining an already overburdened system. Maine currently has the second highest special education identification rate in the country.
Researchers call for more state support
A Multi-Tiered System of Supports, known as MTSS, is essentially a tiered model schools use to ensure all students have their academic, emotional, or behavioral needs met. The system evaluates what tier of support each student needs to stay on pace with their peers, from the most common, tier 1, being general classroom instruction to the least common, tier 3, which includes a small number of students who need personalized instruction or significant mental or behavioral health support interventions. If students don’t make sufficient progress in their assigned tier, MTSS models require districts to intensify personalized support.
The Maine Education Policy Research Institute, a nonpartisan research institute funded by the Maine Legislature and University of Maine System, recommends the model because it helps schools meet students’ needs in a more organized and effective way. The system gives teachers tools to step in early when problems start, instead of reacting after things get worse. When used well, national research has shown that MTSS can reduce behavior issues, improve learning, and make schools feel safer and more supportive. 
So far, the Maine Department of Education has only offered basic introductory training on the system, largely leaving districts on their own to decide how to use the model, researchers said. 
In response to questions about state support for MTSS, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for the department, pointed out that MTSS is currently something that districts can opt into. The department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them, she said.  
However, during the legislative meeting, Wilkinson recommended the department help districts implement the framework, with dedicated resources and support, as well as to expand professional development in behavior management and de-escalation strategies.
“Without those skills, educators will continue to struggle to respond effectively to the behaviors that are occurring,” she said.

(Courtesy of Provo City)About 50 miles from Utah’s capital airport is a small hub that some travelers on the Wasatch Front turn to for ultra-low-cost carriers — the Provo airport. In 2024, about 900,000 passengers used the airport’s four gates to board domestic flights. It was a record-setting number for the facility. However, as soon as this year that number could multiply. 
Provo City broke ground for an airport expansion on Monday. The plans are to build an extended apron, increasing parking capacity for aircrafts by November, according to a news release from the city.

One of the most substantial changes, however, is scheduled to open by late 2028 — the facility’s expansion to host 10 gates in total.  
“Thanks to American Airlines’ frequent daily flights to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Phoenix-Sky Harbor (PHX), travelers from PVU now enjoy easy access to over 270 global destinations, both domestic and international,” Brian Torgersen, Provo Airport director, said in the release. “And the connectivity will only improve with our expansion from four gates to ten gates.”
The funding is secured and the demand is growing, the release reads, especially with major events on the state’s horizon. The project’s price tag is $80 million, according to a presentation filed to the Legislature, which will be paid by different programs from the Federal Aviation Administration, the state, Utah County, Mountainland Association of Governments, and Provo City. 
This year, lawmakers also approved a one-time payment of $4.5 million to support the project. 
“This expansion positions PVU not just as a regional airport, but as a vital part of Utah’s growing transportation network — ready to welcome the world, including visitors for the 2034 Winter Olympics,” Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi said in a statement.

But plans will continue beyond this development. By summer 2026, the airport is also scheduled to have a master plan for another two decades. 
Utah County pledged $78 million to help fund the expansion, including a $19.5 million up-front payment gathered with a tourism tax, and an annual contribution of $3.9 million for the next 15 years, according to a Utah County news release. The investment would contribute to the gates’ expansion, as well as efforts to grow baggage handling and ticketing areas, and prepare it for international travel.
“This expansion is more than just bricks and mortar — it’s a bold step into the future,” Utah County Commissioner Amelia Powers Gardner said in the release. “We’re building infrastructure that not only meets today’s needs but sets the stage for tomorrow’s growth, global events, and economic opportunity.”

Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, speaks to Rep. Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on April 1, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. The House passed legislation he filed to allow judges to issue percentage bonds. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday approved legislation allowing defendants to pay less than the full amount of the bond to be released from jail as their cases proceed in court.
HB 42, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, passed 66-32. It allows judges to issue a percentage bond to defendants to be released from pretrial confinement instead of paying a bail bond company to secure their release.
“A few years ago, we passed an amendment to the Alabama Bail Reform Act that removed three words,” England said during the discussion on the floor. “The three words were, ‘a part of,’ so it basically requires the total sum of the bail to be paid in order to secure release. This bill restores those three words so it would allow judges to take partial, percentage bonds.”

If an individual fails to appear in court, the money paid by the defendant will be returned to the court to pay for expenses or restitution.
England filed similar legislation in 2024 that was approved by the House of Representatives but did not come out of the Senate..
The bill leaves just about all the language of the Alabama Bail Reform Act in place but adds the three words that England referred to during the floor discussion back into state statute.
HB 42 has been one of the few criminal justice reform bills that the House chamber has approved for the session. The House Judiciary Committee hosted a public hearing on the legislation in late February with one person speaking on the legislation.
Victor Howard, who owns a bail bond company based in Madison County, said the bill fails to hold people accountable and will not entice people to appear for their scheduled court.When defendants are not able to pay the full amount of their bond, they’ll pay a bail bond company a percentage of the total bail amount, typically 10%, and the company assumes responsibility for the person to appear at their scheduled hearings.
In March, the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve the bill and allow it to move forward to the full House chamber.
Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, who voted for the bill, called it “a small step, but it is a step in the right direction.”.
“We have done so much for title bonds, payday loans, but there is no reform and no oversight on this,” he said during floor discussion. “Let’s work together to take it to the next step.”

In 2021, the legislature passed the “Second Amendment Preservation Act,” which prevented Missouri law officers from enforcing federal gun laws that were considered to be “infringements” on Second Amendment rights.
In 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the act unconstitutional because it violated the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal laws take precedent over state laws.
The court’s decision said that while Missouri could withhold aid to federal enforcement, the language in the original act would negate federal laws directly.
Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican Dixon, proposed bringing the act back with House Bill 1175.
“This is a proposal I have to kind of address what the Eighth Circuit had held and then reenact the substantive provision at the heart of the Second Amendment Preservation Act,” Hardwick said.
Hardwick believes the language of his bill would not be considered unconstitutional. HB 1175 would restrict state agencies from enforcing or aiding in the enforcement of federal gun laws that differ from Missouri’s laws.
Hardwick’s bill would also allow Missourians the ability to sue law enforcement agencies for up to $50,000 per occurrence should they work to enforce or aid in the enforcement of federal gun laws.
“What (Missouri law enforcement) can’t do is be conscripts to the federal government,” Hardwick said, describing the bill.
The original law, as well as Hardwick’s reenactment, have drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies around the state. Police officers from Columbia, Nixa, Versailes, Rolla and Branson were in attendance at Monday’s hearing.
Some concerns presented by law enforcement include potentially frivolous lawsuits brought on by the bill and the potential loss of access to federal resources, like databases.
Aaron Dorr, a gun rights activist for the Missouri Firearms Coalition, attempted to dispel some of these concerns during his testimony. Dorr said the legislation would not affect agencies’ ability to access federal resources or to work with the federal government unless the primary subject of the work was in federal firearm enforcement.
 Police Testimony

While many police who gave testimony agree with the sentiment of the bill, they voiced concern for the unintended consequences they believe could come from the bill.
Columbia Assistant Police Chief Lance Bolinger noted that even if the law does not technically impede agencies, attorneys for law enforcement agencies are likely to take a restrictive approach when dealing with a new Second Amendment law to avoid potential lawsuits.
“Regardless of what the intentions are when we pass these laws, it is how the attorneys for the police department interpret them, that’s what really matters,” Bolinger said, describing the effect of the original law. “Because what (the original law) did for us is it pretty much shut down all of our federal assistance.”
Bolinger said he is concerned that state agencies may stop using federal resources out of fear of litigation if a new Second Amendment act is approved.
When the original law was put into place, one of the things the Columbia Police Department lost was a machine that helps to identify shell casings, Bolinger said. This was because the machine was provided by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
“This weekend in Columbia we had over 100 different shell casings that were dropped on our city,” Bolinger said regarding a shooting at Cosmo Park Saturday. “Trying to put those pieces together and figure out what gun fired what shell casing is going to be impossible without that kind of technology.”
Bolinger also noted that federal prison time for gun violations is often longer than state prison time, which means it’s sometimes advantageous to prosecute suspected criminals for federal charges instead of state.
Sean Fagen, the chief of police in Rolla, said he is an “avid supporter of the Second Amendment,” but voiced concerns about frivolous lawsuits that might arise because of the bill.
Fagen said these lawsuits could potentially stem from cooperation with federal law enforcement relating to narcotics.
“Usually when you have narcotics you have firearms involved,” Fagen said.
Fagen said he fears that if a narcotics case with state and federal cooperation was taken up by federal courts and gun charges were added, Missouri offices could be open to lawsuits.
An unlikely opponent to the bill was Ron Calzone, director of Missouri First, an organization that aims to protect Missouri’s legislative sovereignty from federal overreach. Calzone said he was a champion of the original law, but takes issue with the new proposal because it’s too broad and may interfere with an ongoing push to reinstitute the original law.
Calzone said the bill could potentially go beyond what he sees as federal “infringements” to the Second Amendment, instead applying to all federal laws pertaining to guns.
“The 2021 version of SAPA only forbade state involvement in federal laws we considered to harm the right to keep and bear arms,” Calzone said. “But (this bill) applies to all federal laws quote ‘regarding firearms.’”
Calzone said if the federal government passed a law increasing gun rights, Missouri police would be restricted from helping to enforce those laws under the proposed law.
Joan Haven, a volunteer for Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America, said she believes this legislation would make it harder for law enforcement to stop gun violence.
According to the most recent CDC data compiled in 2022, Missouri ranks fifth among the states in firearm mortality per capita.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Amid rumblings and fear of a larger presence from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Southern Nevada this week, attorneys and immigration groups are urging people to plan ahead but not to panic.
The Nevada Immigration Coalition hosted a virtual press conference Monday to address the concerns they are hearing in the community. 
Numerous immigration attorneys told coalition members that they’ve heard there are “expanded and ongoing ICE activities this week in Las Vegas,” said Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada.
“ICE raids have a devastating impact not only on the detained person but their families, businesses and communities as a whole,” Martin said. “Immigrants in Nevada are the backbone of Nevada’s community and economy. ICE enforcement actions ripple through the schools, churches and businesses we attend.”
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office didn’t respond to questions from Nevada Current about whether their offices have had recent contact with ICE officials regarding potential enforcement efforts happening in the Las Vegas area. ICE also didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
President Donald Trump has ramped up deportation efforts and targeted previously protected immigrant populations for removal since resuming office. To aid in his goal of higher enforcement, Trump rescinded a 2011 policy prohibiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals. 
Immigration agents have also targeted legal permanent residents, visa holders, and at least one individual the Trump administration admitted it wrongfully removed. 
Federal immigration authorities also revoked the visas of international students across the country, including four last week from UNLV.
Martha Menendez, a Nevada immigration attorney and member of the coalition, said Las Vegas hasn’t seen major enforcement actions of the type ICE has executed in other parts of the country. However, as immigration efforts intensify, there is concern that could change soon. 
“There has been a lot of misinformation and chaotic information happening,” Menendez said. “The fact that people are calling and people are scared makes a lot of sense to me.” 
In general, Menendez said across the country immigration agents are using tactics immigration advocates and attorneys “haven’t seen before,” including arrests “without identifying uniforms or gear or arrests without any indications of why” the person is being detained. 
“This isn’t necessarily what we are seeing in Nevada,” she said. “These are federal agents who can easily do that here. That’s one reason why attorneys are also more nervous and sensitive right now. We are seeing a lot of actions we would never imagine we would be seeing.”
Martin said they’ve heard several reports from the community of people potentially being detained including “eight men being arrested from a work site” in Downtown Las Vegas. Martin did not identify the work site. Organizers are trying to determine if the arrests were carried out by plain-clothed immigration agents, who have deployed similar tactics across the country. 
“We’ve also heard from some attorneys in the attorney community that there are possibly 100 ICE agents who have moved into the area to complete an enforcement operation,” Martin said.
Menendez said attorneys she has talked with haven’t heard of any situation in Southern Nevada of agents showing up at people’s homes.  
LVMPD had previously said that its officers “will not enforce immigration violations” or won’t stop, detain or arrest people “on the grounds they are an undocumented immigrant.” If someone is arrested or charged with other alleged crimes, the department will notify ICE officials. 
The passage of the Laken Riley Act, over the opposition of a majority of Democrats in Congress yet supported by Nevada’s entire Democratic congressional delegation, now allows law enforcement to contact ICE when people are detained for nonviolent offenses like shoplifting even when they haven’t been convicted of a crime. 
The coalition also warned people to be weary of misinformation going around. 
Bethany Khan, a spokeswoman with the Culinary Union, said there were “unfounded rumors” being shared on social media that employees with temporary visas were being laid off. 
“Folks need to be really cautious about sharing those rumors,” she said. “We are not expecting 100s of folks to be terminated. That is not correct.”
Know your rights
While groups are uncertain if potential enforcement could happen relatively soon, Menendez said immigrants should be aware of their rights, and plan for the worst case scenario. 
“We want people to be prepared,” Menendez said. “Not because we want them to be scared. Because we want them to protect themselves.”
Menendez said if ICE agents come to people’s homes, they should request to see a judicial warrant before they open the door.
A judicial warrant, which is signed by a federal or state judge, is different from an administrative warrant, which comes from an immigration agency or another federal agency but is not signed by a federal or state judge. 
If agents don’t have a judicial warrant, “they do not have the right to come in to arrest you,” Menendez said. 
If agents have a judicial warrant, “then the one person listed on that warrant should head outside,” she said. 
People at risk “of being deported or separated from their family in any way” should  “prepare a family plan” and “have all the necessary documents in one place,” she said.
ICE agents, like other law enforcement, can enter public stores and businesses, “but can’t come into the backroom unless someone with authority allows them to,” Menendez said.
“If you are stopped, do not tell them anything,” she said. “That’s one of the biggest rights we have: the right to remain silent. You should probably give them your name but no more.”
This includes gathering necessary immigration and financial documents, custody arrangements and even a plan for someone to take care of pets.  
“While we may have dark days ahead, we will always work to protect our freedoms, our families and our communities,” Martin said. “We deserve a brighter future and will continue to fight for it. We’ve stood up to oppression before and have made it to the other side.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector_The Alabama Senate on Thursday passed a bill aimed at streamlining the process for restoring voting rights to some individuals with past felony convictions.
SB 153, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, would require the state’s Board of Pardons and Paroles to develop new procedures to make the restoration process easier. The bill passed the Senate 27-0.
“This requires [Board of Pardons and Paroles] to post notices so people know how to have their rights restored, and once they have met that requirement, that Pardons and Paroles is the one that really is going to be notifying the Secretary of State,” Coleman-Madison said in a phone interview Friday.

Under existing Alabama law, individuals can lose their right to vote following a conviction in state or federal court. They may have that right restored by the Board of Pardons and Paroles if they meet certain requirements, such as paying fines, fees and court costs and having completed their sentence.
The bill seeks to make the restoration process more transparent and accessible. It requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles and the Secretary of State to develop and make available on their websites a specific form and instructions for applying for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote. This applies to individuals who met the eligibility criteria outlined in the state code before Oct. 1, 2025. Applicants would submit this form to the board for review.
The board would be required to provide the secretary of state with the individual’s address and the date their voting rights were restored.
Once the information is received, the secretary of state would then notify both the individual and the board of registrars in the county where the individual resides about the restoration date. The county board of registrars would be required to add the individual’s name back to the poll list and inform the person of their eligibility date, unless the individual had never been registered to vote prior to their conviction.
Coleman-Madison said efforts to streamline the voting rights restoration process go back a few years to when she worked with former Sen. Cam Ward who is now director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles. In an interview Friday, Ward confirmed working with Coleman-Madison and said that he had “no problem” with legislation, calling it a “great idea.”
“I think she just tried to do an administrative streamlining, which I’ve always said should be done anyway,” Ward said, adding that it wouldn’t be a policy change but an administrative one.
Ward said that once a person completes their sentence, they are given a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote in many cases, depending on the crime. He said the individuals then have to take the certificate to the Alabama Secretary of State, where the secretary of state can make the final determination about that individual’s voting eligibility.
“What we do is we go through the process of certifying … the right to vote, and then actually, the Secretary of State makes a final call. We don’t,” Ward said.
Messages seeking comment were left with the Secretary of State’s office.
Coleman-Madison said the bill would most impact people who “come out and try to get their lives back together,” saying that “these are family people who want to be role models for their children and their spouses.”
Coleman-Madison also said it’s important to notify people who had their voting rights restored. The bill would mandate that the Board of Pardons and Paroles publicly post on its website the names of everyone whose voting rights have been restored under the relevant state code section. The Board must list the county where each person was last registered or their last known county of residence if they had never registered before their conviction.
“You can send it to the last known address. They may not get it, but if you put it up on a site, you can let people know you go to that site, and that’s where you can check it,” she said.
The bill moves to the House for consideration.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate Education Policy committee heard from critics and supporters of religious instruction in public schools on Wednesday.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, mirrors HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, which was rejected by the House Education Committee on April 2. The legislation requires local school boards to adopt a policy regarding released time religious instruction (RTRI). Alabama law already allows school boards to adopt a policy, but this legislation would mandate it. 
“I just want to stress again that this is completely optional for students and requires parental consent,” Shelnutt said. “They keep saying it takes away local control. This bill does not take away control of the local board. They have the right to make a policy and they can decide if they want to not do anything.”

Ben Baker, superintendent of Dale County Schools, criticized the legislation, saying it does take away local control from school boards.
“School systems do not need more mandates. Current law leaves the decision to local school boards who are best positioned to determine whether release time instruction aligns with the needs of their community,” he said. 
He said the lack of a definition for “religious instruction” causes many issues and is a threat to his Christian values.
“When it says religious, am I now going to have to release students to go and sacrifice goats and worship goats or maybe some type of satanic thing? I can’t live with that,” he said. “Public schools are not run by out of touch bureaucrats. They’re run by locally elected and appointed community members.”
Jennifer Riggs, a mother from Huntsville, shared her experience with LifeWise Ministry, a nonprofit that does RTRI. 
“As I read about Lifewise I quickly became intrigued and convinced that this program could be the answer to meeting that long felt desire for my children, and others like mine, to have the Bible taught during their school day,” Riggs said.
Riggs said she became part of a steering committee for the ministry that, according to the sample curriculum, teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.” She said her local school board denied her request to have RTRI.
“We then tried to present before our superintendent and we were told no he said there were too many mandates and requirements that we could not be accommodated,” she said.
Marty Griffin, a staff member at the First Baptist Church in Gulf Shores, said the Gulf Shores Superintendents Matt Akin denied the church’s request for a RTRI program. A message seeking comment from Akin was left Monday afternoon.
“We believe their decision was driven by fear. Fear of if we approve this, what if this unusual situation happens,” Griffin said. “We believe that a bill like SB 278 would alleviate that pressure from them to make that decision.”
Ryan Hollingsworth, the executive director of Alabama State Superintendents Association, said RTRI will take more time away from teachers. He said it should be the parent’s responsibility to teach their children about religion on their own time.
“The State Board of Education put a lot of things in place that we have to teach during the school day. All we have in the school year is 1,080 hours,” he said. “I think if you’re a parent and that’s a priority then you make sure in those hours that you have, those 7,680 hours that you have them, that you make that work.”
The committee did not vote on the bill, but the chair of the committee, Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, said the committee will take up the legislation again soon.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Two years ago, a first-come first-served process allowed one Florida group to hoover up every dollar of available funding for Nevada’s private school scholarship program, which led to a perceived budget shortfall and a contentious 12-hour legislative meeting.
Now, Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno is sponsoring a bill aimed at addressing the administrative issues that led to that hubbub.
Assembly Bill 441 does not affect the total funding amount for the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship program, better known as Opportunity Scholarships. The program and its funding have been a political battleground for Republicans and Democrats since being established in 2015.
AB441 would create a 30-day application period during which the scholarship-granting organizations would submit to the Department of Taxation their applications for accessing funds. The Department of Taxation would then approve applications based on a mandated order of priority: Students already receiving a scholarship are first, then siblings of returning students, and then everyone else.
What happened in 2023 was that one Florida-based organization, AAA Scholarship Foundation, claimed the entirety of the $6.66 million available, leaving nothing for the other organizations who had been counting on the money. That led Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to ask the Democratic-controlled  Interim Finance Committee for $3.2 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds for the scholarship program. When his request was denied, Lombardo accused the majority party of “forcibly removing hundreds of low-income students from their schools.”
https://nevadacurrent.com/2023/08/10/democrats-reject-lombardos-3-2m-funding-request-for-private-school-scholarships/
Democrats at the time called it a “manufactured crisis” fanned by a Republican governor who earlier that year had proposed a massive expansion of the scholarship program only to walk away from a contentious legislative session with enough funding to keep the program at its current level. 
According to the most recent annual report on Opportunity Scholarships, which covered scholarships for the 2023-24 academic year, AAA had given out $5.8 million to at least 957 students and was still awarding money in December 2023. Meanwhile, three organizations that had given out money the year prior gave out nothing.
Monroe-Moreno last week told lawmakers on the Assembly Revenue Committee, which advanced the bill, that AAA publicly vowed to help affected students but did not follow through.
She added that one organization told her that their students did not get funded by AAA.
AAA Scholarship Foundation CEO Kim Dyson declined the Nevada Current’s request for an interview but emailed press releases from after that 2023 meeting stating that the organization was opening a special application period for students who’d been affected.
Dyson in a letter of opposition to AB441 said that the organization “awarded scholarships to every eligible transferring student who applied with us.”
The Nevada Independent reported in September 2023 that 283 students applied to AAA for a scholarship during that application period. That was less than half the amount of the number private school voucher advocates had said would be affected by the IFC decision the prior month.
For the 2024 funds, the Department of Taxation considered all applications received on one set date (June 14, 2024) to be received at the same time. Then, the department prorated the available funds, resulting in each organization receiving 76% of what they requested.
Dyson in an email said the organization is “grateful” for that change.
AB441 would also require scholarship-granting organizations to expend the money they receive within 18 months, with any unspent money after that time period going back to the state.
Representatives from AAA testified to lawmakers in August 2023 that the organization had $13 million in reserves.
AAA on Monday confirmed to the Current  that the organization still has $13 million in reserves.
It’s unclear how much reserves funding the other scholarship-granting organizations have. In 2023, those organizations had about $5 million combined.
Dyson in a letter of opposition to AB441 argued that reserves ensure financial stability and that the organization has followed the 2017 guidance from the Nevada Department of Education and Nevada Treasurer’s Office.
“Unlike some other” scholarship-granting organizations, “we have never had to cancel scholarships for eligible returning students,” she wrote.

Around the U.S., about 90,000 tons of nuclear waste is stored at over 100 sites in 39 states, in a range of different structures and containers.
For decades, the nation has been trying to send it all to one secure location.
A 1987 federal law named Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, as a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste – but political and legal challenges led to construction delays. Work on the site had barely started before Congress ended the project’s funding altogether in 2011.
The 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. This renewed interest gives new urgency to the effort to find a place to put the waste.
In March 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments related to the effort to find a temporary storage location for the nation’s nuclear waste – a ruling is expected by late June. No matter the outcome, the decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will probably continue for many years to come.
I am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are generally two forms of significantly radioactive waste in the U.S.: waste from making nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and waste from generating electricity at nuclear power plants. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments.
 Waste from weapons manufacturing

Remnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called “defense waste,” will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. These canisters are 10 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter, weighing approximately 5,000 pounds when filled.
For now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and Savannah River, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. At Savannah River, some of the waste has already been processed with glass, but much of it remains untreated.
At both of those locations, some of the radioactive waste has already leaked into the soil beneath the tanks, though officials have said there is no danger to human health. Most of the current efforts to contain the waste focus on protecting the tanks from corrosion and cracking to prevent further leakage.
 Waste from electricity generation

The vast majority of nuclear waste in the U.S. is spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.
Before it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. These bundles of fuel rods are about 12 to 16 feet long and about 5 to 8 inches in diameter. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.
After about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant’s property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down.
After about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant’s property. These vaults have vents to ensure air flows past the canisters to continue cooling them.
As of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country.
Even reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant.

 The threat of water

One threat to these storage methods is corrosion.
Because they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water.
In the U.S., nine are within two miles of the ocean, which poses a particular threat to the waste containers. As waves break on the coastline, saltwater is sprayed into the air as particles. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it’s common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean.
At nuclear waste storage locations near the ocean, that salt spray can settle on the steel canisters. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans’ kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces.
In recent years, the U.S. Department of Energy has funded research, including my own, into the potential dangers of this type of corrosion. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. But a radioactive leak would require not only corrosion of the container but also of the zirconium rods and of the fuel inside them. So it is unlikely that this type of corrosion would result in the release of radioactivity.
 A long way off

A more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away.
Not only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is.
Perhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the waste will stay where it is.

Photo illustration by Getty Images.Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.

Kennedy Jr. attended funeral services April 6 for Daisy Hildebrand, 8, the second Texas child to die from the measles this year.

A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.
Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The Republican Senate supermajority spent nearly four hours beating back attempts to amend the state’s two-year budget on Monday ahead of a key deadline, mostly spurning ideas from their Democratic colleagues.
The body opted to accept just three changes to House Bill 1001, including one to clarify that the Midwest Continental Divide Commission would get $4 million over the biennium — and not $2 million — and another reviving a specialty license plate. 
But another 60-plus amendments, mostly from the chamber’s 10-member Democratic caucus, were rejected. 
Sen. Andrea Hunley, still emotional after getting her amendment to require doula reimbursement defeated without discussion, decried lack of support for Democratic motions related to health care. 
“Those aren’t partisan issues. At least, they shouldn’t be. But not a single one was accepted — at least not yet. I’m going to be optimistic,” said Hunley, D-Indianapolis. “Our state’s budget is intended to be a reflection of our values in our state … (and) our Hoosiers deserve better than a chorus of ‘no,’ ‘no,’ no.’”
 Saying ‘no’ to Democrats…

At various points, Democrats tried to increase funding for subsidized child care and tuition support. 
One such amendment from Sen. Fady Qaddoura separated curricular materials from the overall formula — funding them at $244 million rather than $160 million — while another boosted complexity funding to support impoverished students. 
Qaddoura’s motions, like others, were quashed with little discussion. 
Republicans also rejected Democratic amendments to raise funds through cigarette, alcohol or gaming taxes, sometimes known as sin taxes.

Speaking on cigarette taxes, Sen. Ryan Mishler said that he wanted to “keep all options open,” but wished to wait until the revenue forecast slated for Wednesday before implementing a tax increase. 
Mishler, R-Mishawaka, is the Senate sponsor for House Bill 1001 and chief budget architect for Senate Republicans. 
“We may not have a full budget forecast but we already know … it’s going to be very, very tight,” countered Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington. 
Public health advocates have long sought an increase to the cigarette tax in Indiana, which has one of the lowest taxation rates in the region. But senators have repeatedly batted away such increases even after House lawmakers advanced them in back-to-back budget cycles. 
In a perennial effort, one suggestion sought to create a pathway for legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes, arguing that it would reduce the legal burden imposed on courts for minor possession, provide veterans and other first responders with requested medicinal relief and bring much-needed revenue to the state. 
Many Hoosiers, said Sen. Rodney Pol, already cross into Illinois, Michigan and Ohio to legally purchase cannabis. The majority of Hoosiers support legalizing marijuana to a certain extent, according to public policy polling. 
“This is a conversation that we just keep avoiding and it’s just inevitable,” said Pol, D-Chesterton.
The amendment, like the ones proposing sin tax increases, was defeated on a voice vote. 
 … and rejecting Republican ideas

Even ideas that had previously passed the chamber were voted down by Republicans when suggested by Democrats, including an effort that would have established a newborn tax credit. 
“Raising a child is incredibly costly, especially as the cost of living continues to rise and more families struggle to make ends meet,” said Pol. “Parents are stretching their budgets to afford diapers, secure reliable child care and care for their own mental health.” 
  Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, introduces an amendment to the budget on April 14, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
A bill from Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, to create just that passed out of the chamber unanimously in February but died in the House without a hearing. No Republican spoke on the amendment to say why it was defeated on Monday. 
And while the House version of the budget struck a tax on the period products, Senate budget writers nixed that proposal.
“These are very necessary products,” said Hunley. “What I’m really asking us to do is stay in alignment with what our bipartisan friends in the House did.”
The sole Republican to speak on the amendment, Sen. Liz Brown, compared purchasing period products to other expenses for children, such as sports equipment. 
“That becomes an essential item in your budget. Whether it’s a new pair of sneakers, making sure your kid has soccer cleats, making sure you can pay for a jersey — whatever it is. All those items that you purchase become essential,” said Brown, R-Fort Wayne. 
Hunley’s amendment, which also exempted the sales tax on adult diapers, and Yoder’s amendment on just period products were both rejected. 
Even Gov. Mike Braun’s ideas didn’t get the greenlight from Senate Republicans. 
Qaddoura introduced a measure that would have created a school tax holiday for student supplies. However, Mishler pointed to concerns from retailers around implementing it as well as concerns about potential future expansions.
Senate Republicans split with House GOP on education in latest budget

One Republican senator who does not caucus with the GOP also had his proposals defeated, though some colleagues broke ranks with the supermajority to support his ideas. 
Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, introduced four separate efforts that were all rejected, including the expansion of the homestead exemption for senior citizens and requiring the Senate wait 24 hours after a conference committee report on the budget before calling a concurrence vote. 
On the latter, he pointed to the 2023 budget vote, when a last-minute adjustment to school runs upended a seemingly routine process — meaning that a newly written budget was published just a few hours before the final vote.  
“That’s not fair. It’s not fair to us; it’s not fair to our constituents that we don’t have enough time to read and understand what’s in the most important bill we pass,” said Young. 
Though a general practice, the Senate doesn’t have a firm rule. Citing that tradition, Mishler asked for the amendment to be rejected. 
A full vote on the budget is expected in the Senate Tuesday but the spending plan will likely change following the forecast revenue on Wednesday.

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems, and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy, and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits, and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting, and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing, and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
 ‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about what the loss in funds will mean for their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation.
A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black, and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
 Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark lawrequiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Getty Images)As the CEO of Kem Krest, a mid-sized company with a deeply rooted employee-first culture, I’ve always believed that caring for our associates means going beyond competitive wages and traditional benefits. For years, like many American businesses, we’ve struggled with the rising costs of health care and the challenge of offering meaningful, affordable benefits.
We appreciate that this has been a top priority for state policymakers for many years. As a business, we are always looking for ways to reduce unnecessary spending, and a direct-to-employer partnership with our local hospital presented the perfect opportunity to cut out waste and reinvest into our most valuable asset – our employees.
Originally to manage costs, we implemented high-deductible health plans paired with wellness programs that offered cash incentives for participation. But over time, the data told us a different story: those incentives mostly benefited employees who were already healthy. Meanwhile, many others avoided seeking care unless it was catastrophic — discouraged by high out-of-pocket costs. We realized this approach wasn’t just ineffective; it was inconsistent with our values of putting associates, their families, and their health first.
My perspective began to shift even further during my time serving on the Board of Beacon Health System. Though I’m not a medical professional, this role opened my eyes to the critical role community hospitals play, not just in delivering care, but in shaping the overall health of the communities they serve.
How to help employees
We surveyed our team and confirmed what many employers are also discovering: health care and childcare are the two biggest challenges facing working families. While exploring solutions, we learned a surprising insight: Many of our associates weren’t seeing a primary care doctor at all. Most prioritized their children’s health care needs and would visit the ER only if absolutely necessary. That reframed the question for us. Instead of asking, “Is an on-site clinic feasible?” we asked, “What’s the right thing to do?”
And the answer was clear: bring accessible, high-quality care directly to our people — on-site and at no cost to them or their families.
Initially, we considered doing it ourselves. But we quickly realized that to do it right, we needed more than just a doctor. We needed infrastructure, equipment, IT systems, compliance protocols, and most importantly, employee trust. That’s where Beacon came in.
In partnership with Beacon, we launched our on-site clinic that features a private entrance and the look and feel of a traditional doctor’s office. Beacon provided the clinical staff, scheduling systems, electronic records, and the medical equipment.
As usage grew, we identified another opportunity: prescription costs. Employees paid the same co-pay regardless of pharmacy pricing, while the company absorbed wide variations in drug costs. So we expanded our clinic to include free prescription medications for the most common conditions. This not only reduced our overall spend but also created a powerful incentive for employees to seek care early.
Real results
The results have been extraordinary.
In 2024, our Indiana clinic saw over 500 visits, ranging from routine checkups and labs to chronic condition management and mental health services. Associates who hadn’t seen a doctor in years came in for physicals and women’s health screenings. Most meaningfully, we know of at least three lives saved through early detection of heart disease and cancer — conditions that could have been fatal if left undiagnosed.
In 2024 alone, Kem Krest has saved more than $800,000 in total health care expenses, and for the first time in years, we’ve seen flat to declining insurance premiums. The clinic has also become a standout advantage in both recruiting and retention.
Encouraged by the success of our Elkhart, Indiana site, we’ve expanded our clinics to our Wisconsin and Michigan facilities, with plans to open another in Carmel, Indiana by 2027.
What we’ve done at Kem Krest wouldn’t have been possible without the visionary partnership of Beacon Health, a community hospital system dedicated to improving lives — not just treating illness.
As state lawmakers navigate the complexities of our current health care system, I implore them to encourage innovative, market-based solutions that demonstrate real results, as they have for us at Kem Krest, instead of more government regulation. Employers have the tools they need to implement these types of partnerships, which lower costs across the board while improving health care quality, access, and value for employees.
Real commitment means making bold, values-based investments—even when they’re unconventional. We’re proud to be part of that movement.

Of the 96 microbusiness licenses issued by the state through a lottery since the program’s inception in 2023, regulators have revoked 34. 
Two were revoked for having a disqualifying felony offense on the owners’ record. The rest were for failing to show that the microbusiness licenses would be majority owned and operated by eligible individuals, according to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation. 
For more than a year, The Independent has documented the pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limited their profit and control of the business. Nearly all of the 32 licenses that have been revoked for ownership issues followed this pattern.
New rules target middlemen in Missouri cannabis industry to prevent ‘predatory’ practices

In December, the division announced new proposed rules for the marijuana microbusiness program designed to combat predatory practices during the application process. 
“These revisions are intended to ensure microbusiness licenses are issued to eligible individuals… and to address the trend of predatory arrangements in microbusiness licensing,” the division said in a December press release announcing the proposed changes. “Specifically, these draft rule revisions should mitigate the ongoing efforts of ineligible entities to acquire licenses by taking advantage of eligible individuals.”
The first nine revocations occurred last year, following the state’s first lottery for licenses in 2023.
The latest 25 revocations came on Monday, marking the end of a six-month investigation into some of the licenses that were selected out of the second lottery and awarded in July.
The revocations took effect on April 14.
Cannabis investor Michael Halow is connected to 22 awarded licenses the state has now revoked, including 16 revoked on Monday. In the sixteen notices of revocation sent in October, the division stated the licensee entered into an agreement that would result in someone besides the eligible applicant “becoming an owner of this and 15 other microbusiness licenses.”
In an email to The Independent Monday, Halow said he “respectfully disagrees” with the division’s decision and he plans to appeal. 
“We provide assistance to marijuana dispensary applicants who need it most,” Halow stated. “These are often people without generational wealth or experience as an entrepreneur. They open businesses in neighborhoods in need of jobs and economic opportunity.” 
Halow is connected to more than 700 of the 3,600 applications submitted for Missouri’s lottery since the program began.
In total, groups flooding the lottery have made up about 1,400 of the 3,600 applications submitted since the program began, meaning they’ve represented about 40% of what’s gone into the lottery and come away with nearly 40% of the licenses.
“As for the criticism regarding ‘flooding the lottery,’ it’s important to recognize that more applicants is actually a sign of greater participation in a government program,” Halow told The Independent in October, “which is a positive outcome.”
Missouri cannabis microbusiness ‘mentor’ connected to licenses under state investigation 

Four licenses connected to cannabis investors and microbusiness mentors David Brodsky and Scott Wootton were also revoked Monday. 
In the letters of pending revocation sent in October, the division stated that their agreements included “false or misleading information.”
“The licensee entered into an agreement that transfers ownership and operational control to another entity,” the letters stated.
Separately, notices of investigation were issued involving the group’s other three licenses back in July, stating regulators wanted to ensure the businesses continue “to be majority owned and operated by eligible individuals.” The division has not yet responded regarding The Independent’s questions on the status of these licenses. 
Brodsky and Wootton declined to comment on the division’s Monday announcement.
Amy Moore, the division’s director, said in a town hall meeting in February that Missouri’s microbusiness cannabis program will never get off the ground if regulators are consistently forced to revoke licenses over concerns about unlawful predatory practices.
That’s why new rules must be put in place to root out these practices and ensure the program lives up to its promise, Moore said.
“It is not sustainable to keep going through rounds of license issuance and then having to do rounds of revocations,” Moore told the attendees. “We’re never going to get this market fully built out.”

The delay in medical care left her permanently disabled.,"A woman who was suffering a stroke sued New Jersey after a state trooper mistook her failure to respond to commands as inebriation and arrested her instead of seeking medical help.A judge has rejected the state’s bid for a new trial after an Essex County jury handed down an $11.5 million verdict against a New Jersey State Police trooper who mistook a motorist’s stroke for inebriation and arrested her, delaying medical treatment so long she’s now permanently disabled.
In an order issued Friday, Superior Court Judge Thomas Vena also dismissed the state’s claim that jurors got it wrong and refused to set aside or modify their January verdict. He denied, too, the state’s request to reduce the judgment, which attorneys had argued was excessive.
“It does not clearly and convincingly appear to the Court that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law,” Vena wrote. “The Court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict that the jury reached and that no reasonable mind could disagree with the outcome.”
Cheryl Rhines of Jersey City was driving to work in October 2017 when she began feeling ill and pulled over to the shoulder of a highway in Newark, according to the lawsuit her mother later filed.
The responding state trooper, Jennifer Albuja, misinterpreted Rhines’ failure to respond to commands, communicate coherently, or stand upright as intoxication — even though Albuja found no smell or sign of substance use and Rhines had facial drooping and other signs of a stroke, was dressed in business attire at 8 a.m. on a weekday, and had no prior offenses, her lawsuit says.
Albuja failed to get Rhines treatment at a hospital 5 minutes away and instead searched her car and hauled her, handcuffed, to the state police’s Somerville station, delaying treatment by two and half hours, according to the complaint. A sergeant at the station finally called EMTs, but troopers still left Rhines shackled on the floor even after they determined she was in medical distress. Albuja had been a trooper for only two years when she arrested Rhines.
Rhines, now 56, had to leave her job as an event planner and move in with her mother in Nashville because she’s unable to speak or understand what people say to her — a language disorder called global aphasia that’s caused by stroke-related brain damage, her attorney, Dennis M. Donnelly, told the New Jersey Monitor in February.
Vena rejected all of the state’s arguments for reconsideration, including that jurors wrongly assessed damages for both emotional damages and pain and suffering, that the care Rhines’ mother gave her is not compensable, and that evidence of Rhines’ shackling was irrelevant and prejudicial.
“The Court permitted such testimony regarding the Plaintiff being shackled to provide the jury an accurate representation of the events that transpired before she was finally able to receive medical attention and that led to the basis of her complaint. Thus, a new trial is not warranted on this ground,” Vena wrote.
Before trial, the case went through mediation, but the state’s attorneys refused to resolve the case for more than $1 million — and Rhines’ care expenses had exceeded that, Donnelly said in February.
Jurors initially returned a $19.1 million verdict after a nearly month-long trial to cover Rhines’ future medical care, emotional distress, pain and suffering, and loss of income. But they blamed 60% of Rhines’ disabilities on the delayed treatment and 40% on the stroke itself, which the trooper didn’t cause. So they reduced their initial award by 40%.
Vena reminded the state several times in his ruling of that reduction, writing: “This ended up being advantageous for the Defendants.”
Donnelly could not be reached for comment Monday. Attorney William J. Hamilton, who represents the state and Albuja, declined to comment.
The judgment, which now stands at $11.2 million after some tweaking to reflect Rhines’ medical expenses and insurance benefits, is unusually high for lawsuits filed against the state. In 2023, when the state paid out $121 million to settle 364 claims, only 23 resulted in payouts of over $1 million, according to a recent New Jersey Monitor analysis.

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images) The public is encouraged to save the date of the dedication of the new Idaho Women Veterans Memorial, which will now be located at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery in Boise.
The memorial, which was originally planned to be located at the Idaho Veterans Garden in Caldwell, will now have a permanent space at the veterans cemetery, the Idaho Veterans Garden, in partnership with the Idaho Division of Veterans Services, announced in a press release Monday.
The dedication of the memorial will be at 11 a.m. Sept. 5 at the cemetery at 10100 N. Horseshoe Bend Road in Ada County.
“This important decision to relocate the memorial was made with careful consideration, ensuring that it will receive the permanent care it deserves while remaining accessible and visible to all who feel the impact of this profound loss across our state,” the Idaho Division of Veterans Services said in a press release.
The memorial will honor Cpl. Carrie L. French, Idaho’s first woman killed in combat, as well as the contributions of all Idaho women who have bravely served in the military. French was killed June 5, 2005, during the Iraq War when an improvised explosive device, or IED, hit the front of her convoy vehicle and detonated in Kirkuk, Iraq, the Idaho Statesman reported.
“Carrie exemplifies the spirit of camaraderie that flourishes among all veterans — women and men alike — during their service,” the Idaho Division of Veterans Services said in the release. “The memorial will be lovingly maintained and will play a significant centerpiece in the many ceremonies and traditions held at the cemetery each year. Although Carrie rests in her hometown of Caldwell, her legacy as a distinguished service member will be eternally celebrated at the State Veterans Cemetery in Boise.”
Danny Pugmire, from the Idaho Veterans Garden and the founder of the Idaho Women Veterans Memorial, said in the release that the hope is that the memorial will serve as a place of remembrance and reflection for future generations.
“The new location will offer a place for everyone, friends and family to truly honor Carrie and while maintaining the dignity and respect that the memorial deserves,” Pugmire said. 
Jake Faulkner, the director of the veterans cemetery, said locating the memorial at the cemetery is “a privilege and a solemn responsibility that we will embrace with reverence.”
“This memorial stands as a lasting testament to the service and sacrifice of Idaho’s women veterans,” Faulkner said in the release. “It will be thoughtfully maintained and integrated into the cemetery’s traditions, providing a place of reflection, gratitude and remembrance for all who visit.”
The dedication ceremony will include addresses from the memorial’s sculptor and world-renowned artist, Benjamin Victor, Faulkner, Pugmire, and Marisa McCarter, author of the story “Marbles,” which captures McCarter’s friendship and service with French.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Oil and gas drilling is a dirty business and has a serious impact on our wildlands and communities.
It involves the use and release of numerous toxic chemicals that enter the environment via several pathways: drilling, hydraulic fracturing, waste pits, spills, and releases to air.
With oil and gas long being a lifeblood of our economy, it’s not surprising that according to a study published in Environmental Health Perspectives, roughly half of all Oklahomans live within a mile of an active well. But I suspect untold numbers likely live in proximity to orphaned wells. Those are the wells that have been abandoned by companies, without regard to best practices required to shutter them to ensure public safety.
After oil and gas wells are done producing, they must be properly closed to prevent air and water pollution, protect the health of the surrounding communities, restore the property values of the landowner, and in particular, prevent high-priority, climate-forcing methane emissions.
Methane is the second leading greenhouse gas causing global warming after carbon dioxide. And, because it’s often paired with other toxic pollutants, the release of methane into the air can cause debilitating health problems for the millions of people who live near oil and gas operations.
Oklahoma has more than 260,000 unplugged wells, 20,000 of which are “orphan” or abandoned wells.
Based on the number of previously unknown wells that have been found since the start of this century, the actual number is almost undoubtedly appreciably higher, as no records were submitted for many wells drilled in the early 20th century and locations given for documented wells from that time period were often extremely inaccurate.
Until properly plugged, oil and gas wells, besides emitting methane, pose additional environmental and health hazards, including allowing oil, gas and other toxic chemicals, such as arsenic, benzene, and hydrogen sulfide, to seep into the soil and groundwater, contaminating drinking water sources and ecosystems.
Contaminated soil, small oil spills and other surface waste along with old equipment can still be present at orphaned well sites. In some poorly plugged or unplugged wells, gas, salty water, oil, or drilling mud can spill out from the well onto the ground surface potentially harming livestock and other animals.
Estimates show it could cost approximately $7.3 billion to plug and clean up the state’s wells. In contrast, our state coffers have just $45 million worth of bonds. In theory, cleanup is supposed to be guaranteed by bonds that companies fund.
The public’s rightful expectation is that oil and gas operators should be contributing enough in bonds up front to guarantee the financial responsibilities related to well abandonment. Sufficient bonding creates an incentive for companies to plug their own wells: Once the work is completed, the company gets its bond back.
However, as made evident in a May 5, 2024, Propublica story, because of Oklahoma’s lenient bonding requirements and loopholes in existing statutes and rules, there is little to deter wells from being abandoned by those who have no intent to be a legitimate oil and gas operator. Those operators often form shell companies under false ownership names, strip existing wells and sell the salvaged material. The “operator” then goes out of business, abandoning the wells and leaving the responsibility for cleanup to the state.
This situation provided Oklahoma lawmakers with the impetus to overhaul bonding requirements for oil and gas producers with House Bill 1369. This bill, which has advanced to the Senate, would create tiers for amounts paid to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission based on the number of wells owned by an operator.
The Corporation Commission also uses money from an excise tax on oil and gas producers to plug wells with no known owner in Oklahoma. With this in mind, House Bill 1370 would increase the percentage of money flowing to the fund from fossil fuel production. That measure also cleared the state House and awaits consideration in the Senate.
The Oklahoma Energy Resources Board, a state agency funded voluntarily by Oklahoma’s oil and natural gas producers and royalty owners, also focuses on environmental restoration of abandoned well sites. Since the levy’s inception it has funded the restoration of more than 20,000 sites. But as another Propublica investigation reported, some of Oklahoma’s biggest oil companies — 76 in all over the past seven years — have opted out of the fund, forcing the state to refund millions of dollars that would have otherwise gone toward restoring an additional 1,500 orphan well sites.
A final revenue source for plugging wells was supposed to be federal funding available through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Currently, however, that funding is on hold due to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump which halted the disbursement of unspent funds.
Trump’s directive seeks to support the fossil fuel industry and discourage renewable energy policies and projects in the United States.
Should these federal dollars be permanently withheld, the already slow progress of plugging wells in Oklahoma could become collateral damage.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)On the cusp of key legislative deadlines, GOP-led regulations for a marijuana-like drug got more edits Monday — despite vocal opposition from fellow Indiana House Republicans.
Legislation cracking down on homelessness and diversity initiatives, plus promoting high-speed internet access, also passed muster. They return to the Senate for consent to the House’s changes, or to kick off negotiations.
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly.
After third committee vote, delta-8 regulations head to House floor

Senate Bill 478 has gotten further than its predecessors, but its journey hasn’t been smooth. It has been revised at every opportunity possible: during two Senate committee hearings, on the Senate’s floor, in each of a whopping three House committee hearings and, Monday, it was the subject of 17 wide-ranging amendments filed for discussion on the House floor.
The measure sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements. It authorizes the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission to regulate.
Provisions defining “craft hemp flower products” and setting out high milligram limits have sparked opposition from Indiana’s chief attorney and others, but weren’t changed Monday. Instead, lawmakers took up just two of the amendments.
One, removing a new tax that was only partially removed last week, was adopted easily. Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, reminded his colleagues that new taxes must go in House bills.

But the other, raising the cap on retail permits from 9,400 to 20,000 and allowing permits for convenience and drug stores, prompted blowback from Teshka’s own caucus. 
House Speaker Todd Huston presided over a first, then a second voice vote, but both sides were just as loud. Representatives from both caucuses counted up supporters and opponents instead: it was accepted on a vote of 63-21.
Other complaints weren’t addressed.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office wrote that the legislation “expands” a loophole for “high-potency, intoxicating THC products under the guise of hemp,” in a letter to lawmakers. The missive — signed by Legislative Director Erin Tuttle — was included in a Monday morning alert from the American Family Association’s Indiana chapter.
A 2018 federal law defined legal hemp as containing 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight or less, but the letter observes lawmakers didn’t apply that limit to other isomers. Only “very high” caps of 100 milligrams per serving and 3,000 milligrams per package would apply.
The legislation also allows THC potency to be measured by weight or volume — without limits on the product’s size or mass — instead of by dry weight, Rokita’s office continued.
That means manufacturers can increase the milligrams by “manipulating a product’s volume.”
“By allowing these products to be sold, SB 478 effectively creates a parallel cannabis market in Indiana — one that operates entirely outside the state’s marijuana laws at a time when marijuana remains illegal at both the state and federal levels,” the letter said.

It urged lawmakers to instead consider any product containing more than 0.3% total THC by dry weight as banned marijuana.
Homelessness measure divides GOP
House Democrats also spent about an hour apiece attacking proposals they maintain criminalize homelessness and undo progress born out the Civil Rights Movement.
Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, said Senate Bill 197 is “not about punishing people for being homeless.”
“We are never going to arrest or jail our way out of this problem,” said Ireland, the bill’s sponsor in the House. He said the goal is to keep public spaces “accessible and clean, while offering individuals every reasonable opportunity to access the services and the shelter they so desperately need.”
The bill stipulates that “a person may not camp, sleep, or use for long term shelter a public right-of-way or public land unless authorized for that use by the state or political subdivision, as appropriate.”
Before they can make an arrest, officers must first determine “if there are reasonable grounds for an emergency detention of the person.” If not, they must warn the person to leave within the 24- or 72-hour timeframe and offer transportation to a shelter or other form of “temporary accommodations that provide respite and offer access to services and permanent housing options,” within five miles, as long as one exists and has a spot available. If the person refuses or there’s no space, officers must call a local crisis intervention team, if there is one. 
Those who have not moved from a public right-of-way within 24 hours of a law enforcement officer’s warning — or from public land within 72 hours — could be arrested and charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail or a $500 fine. Legal proceedings would be referred to a problem-solving court.
“This is a bill grounded in principle,” Ireland told the House.

“It defends the rule of law, respects property rights, brings compassion to public safety, ensures fairness before fines, offers help before punishment, restores dignity through due process,” he added.
Democrats remained staunchly opposed.
“This is not a compassionate bill. This is a cruelty bill,” Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, said in response to Ireland’s assertion it represents a “compassionate response.”
“If you don’t abide by these rules, then you are going to be criminalized and penalized, and you might have a record simply because you don’t have a place to lay your head,” Pryor said.
Her colleagues also criticized the process.
Rep. Maureen Bauer noted there was no testimony taken when a House committee co-opted a building safety bill to revive homelessness language from a dead bill. 
“It wasn’t vetted properly before the public,” said Bauer, D-South Bend. “… And it adds a new criminal penalty without ever going to (the) Courts and Criminal Code (Committee). If this was about connecting people to services, there would be no criminal penalty.”
The House approved Senate Bill 197 in a 52-40 vote — a narrow margin featuring more than a dozen Republican defections.
Diversity bill debated
Legislation outlawing “discrimination” in state education, employment and licensing “based on a personal characteristic of the person” advanced in a 67-27 vote along party lines.
Senate Bill 289 sponsor Rep. Chris Jeter said “discriminatory” programs have “crept their way into our government institutions” and created “division.”
“This current version of this bill avoids legislating words because words can be manipulated; words can
be weaponized,” Jeter, R-Fishers, said. “This bill instead focuses on actions and behaviors.”
It would also allow Rokita, the attorney general, to impose hefty civil penalties for violations: $50,000 for a first offense and $100,000 for a second or subsequent offense.

But Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary, said pro-diversity policies came into existence for a reason. In a lengthy speech from the House floor, he recalled how his mother faced racist attacks when forced into an attempt to integrate the former Emerson High School.
She and the other Black honors students “were called all kinds of names. They were pushed, they were spit on,” he said. The white teachers refused to let them enter their classrooms, locking the doors instead, while the white students walked out.
Smith further described how he himself wasn’t allowed to eat at certain restaurants, go to certain events or enter certain parts of the city in his younger years. As a 12-year-old, he got off at the wrong bus stop and “got stoned by white children because I was not supposed to be in that neighborhood.”
“I never thought, when I was fighting (in) the Civil Rights Movement, that we would be reversing ourselves in this country,” Smith said.
Senate Bill 289 could also create a “serious problem” for the South Bend Community School Corp., per Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend. He feared the district could be on the hook for damages.
“I believe (it’s) the last school corporation in the state that’s under a (federal) desegregation consent decree,” Dvorak said. It requires each school to mirror the district’s overall Black student population.
Jeter said that federal law reigns supreme in conflicts with state statutes.

Other Democrats said the changes would harm veterans. Jeter said they wouldn’t.
The House also unanimously approved legislation offering a compromise between electricity and telecommunications providers in a bid to speed up the buildout of high-speed internet in rural and other underserved areas throughout Indiana.

[…]","Children outside with a child care teacher at The Playing Field, a Madison child care center that participates in the federal Head Start program. (Courtesy of The Playing Field)A news report that the Trump administration is considering ending the federal government’s Head Start program has alarmed providers and parents who rely on the child care and early education program.
“It would be absolutely devastating,” said Jen Bailey, executive director of Reach Dane, which operates 14 Head Start centers in Dane and Green counties. “The children and families we work with are some of the most vulnerable folks in our communities. The parents in those communities rely on the care we provide to stay employed.”
USA Today reported Friday that the Trump administration “is considering a budget proposal that would zero out funding for Head Start.” The news report quoted an anonymous administration official who said the White House funding blueprint for the 2026 fiscal year doesn’t allocate money for Head Start.
Responding to the report Monday, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) tied the proposal to President Donald Trump’s goal of extending the 2017 tax cuts enacted in his first term.
“Shutting down Head Start — taking care away from kids, firing teachers, and making child care even more expensive for parents — all so President Trump can hand out new tax breaks for the wealthy and well-connected is flat out wrong and you can be sure I will fight this proposal at every turn,” Baldwin said.
Head Start was founded in 1966, part of the War on Poverty undertaken by President Lyndon Johnson. It provides child care and preschool for families with incomes up to the federal poverty guideline. Children living in foster homes are also eligible for Head Start.
In Wisconsin more than 15,000 children are enrolled in more than 300 Head Start child care centers across the state, according to the Wisconsin Head Start Association. With more than 4,300 employees, Head Start ranks in the top 100 employers in Wisconsin, said Jennie Mauer, the association’s executive director.
“At least 70% of our families have a parent who is either working or in school full time,” Mauer said Monday. The remaining families include grandparents who are retired but full-time caregivers for their grandchildren as well as families unable to work due to disabilities or who “are working through some very, very significant challenges.”
She predicted that the impact from ending the program wouldn’t stop with the families who rely on Head Start.
“If Head Start isn’t there, if this program were to shut down, surely there’ll be tremendous cascading economic impacts in our communities,”  Mauer said. “I think for most of the families, it would create a huge labor disruption. With no safe place to have your kids while you’re at work, it’ll create a disaster.
Child care already a crisis
Fears for the survival of Head Start are escalating as the state’s overall child care sector is increasingly under strain. As many as 25% of child care centers in a survey released April 10 said they could close without continuing support in the next state budget.
April Mullins-Datko is Head Start director for ADVOCAP, a social service agency serving Fond du Lac, Winnebago and Green Lake counties. She said that the agency’s four Head Start centers would likely not survive the loss of federal support.
“We would lose services for the 202 children we serve,” Mullins-Datko said. “It would exacerbate the child care crisis we have in our communities, which then has negative impacts on our available workforce.”










I think for most of the families, it would create a huge labor disruption. With no safe place to have your kids while you're at work, it'll create a disaster.


– Jennie Mauer, Wisconsin Head Start Association executive director


ADVOCAP’s centers include three in Fond du Lac County and one in Green Lake County, with 193 families relying on the program for the care and early education of their children.
“Ninety-three percent of my families are working or going to school full time,” Mullins-Datko said.
The agency’s Head Start federal contract is supposed to be good through Dec. 31, 2028, Mullins-Datko said, but with reports of defunding she fears that won’t be honored: “There just doesn’t seem to be any kind of adherence to law and contracts.”
Western Dairyland Economic Opportunity Council provides social services in Buffalo, Jackson, Trempealeau and Eau Claire counties in West Central Wisconsin. The agency’s programs include nine Head Start centers enrolling 442 children. Of those, 382 children are in preschool and 60 are in Early Head Start, for children from birth to age 3, said Thanh Bui-Duquette, Western Dairyland’s Head Start director.
Three centers are in cities — two in Eau Claire and one in Altoona — but the rest are in rural communities.
“We meet the needs of each individual community,” Bui-Duquette said. “The needs of the urban Eau Claire area look very different from rural Trempealeau County.”
Even with jobs, 96% of the families with children in Western Dairyland’s program have incomes below the federal poverty guideline. For children from those families, she said, Head Start has been demonstrated to improve long-term outcomes — increasing the chances of graduating from high school and going on to higher education, and reducing the chances of ending up in the criminal justice system.
“It’s important to have that solid foundation early on, especially for children from disadvantaged families,” Bui-Duquette said.
Payments delayed, offices closed
The news that Head Start is in the crosshairs of budget-writers in the Trump administration follows other jolts to the program in the last two months.
In late January and early February, Head Start operators reported widespread problems in their efforts to collect standard payments from the federal government. Under Head Start contracts, programs incur an expense then submit documentation through a federal online portal to get reimbursed. Head Start programs reported that payments stalled, for nearly two weeks in some cases, without explanation.
Payments have since resumed, but Mauer said directors are reporting demands for more information holding up payments.
“They’re getting substantial delays for things that are accepted expenses, which is concerning,” she said.
On April 1, Head Start operators learned that the program’s five regional offices across the country were closed without any advance notice, including the Chicago office that serves Wisconsin and five other states in the Upper Midwest.
Those events and the report that the program could be defunded have rattled Head Start employees and the parents who have counted on the program, operators say.
“Families and staff are both really scared and concerned,” said Bailey, the Reach Dane director. “Families are reaching out, worried the program is going to close, asking, ‘Is my child still going to be able to go to school?’”
Reach Dane’s human resources staff has been interviewing applicants for teaching jobs in the coming school year, and applicants are nervous about whether the job will exist, she added.
Bailey said the program is trying to be transparent with employees and families about the uncertainty and fight for the program’s survival, all without sparking panic.
“Trying to figure out how to navigate and inform folks when there’s no communication is a hard place to be,” she said.

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)Robert “RJay” Fisher has personal experience with the damage gun violence can cause. His work with Green Bay’s Office of Violence Prevention aims to keep others from experiencing the same harm.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Fisher said that “having a brother who is now incarcerated for a situation that happened in Green Bay, that was pretty tough for me. And I know what type of trauma I experienced from that. I had a brother who was shot here on the west side of Green Bay, about 11 years ago. And so, I remember getting those calls, and having to deal with those emotions, and what that felt like.”
He said other family members have been shot. ”I also have lost a lot of friends due to gun violence,” said Fisher. “And just recently, two years ago, I lost my uncle, one of my only uncles, due to gun violence.” 
Fisher is a violence interrupter at the Office of Violence Prevention, where he builds relationships with community members and tries to prevent violence before it happens. 
The office listens to “rumblings in the community,” Fisher said. When they hear something from social media or word of mouth, it’s their job to put out the fire. 
Fisher said he’s been in the community for a long time and worked for the Green Bay Area Public School District. He said his relationships and people’s respect for him enable him “to intervene in those situations and start conversations.”
“And then if they’re open [to it], I try to either meet with them or bring them into the space,” he said. “That’s why it’s critical to have a home base.”
Green Bay’s Office of Violence Prevention was formed in 2023 after the city was awarded a grant from the Medical College of Wisconsin. On Monday, the office held the grand opening of its new location on the east side of Green Bay. 
Director Andrea Kressin described it as a safe space where relationship building and coaching can happen. This is important for the office’s prevention work to support people who are at the highest risk of engaging in violence or deter them from engaging in further violence, she said.
Police officers operated at the office’s old location, and high-risk individuals might not have a good relationship with police, Fisher said. 
“We kind of take them out of their environment, and bring them in a calm, safe space where we can then use our CBT [cognitive behavioral therapy] strategies to kind of help them rewire the way they think,” Fisher said. 
In its 2023 crime report, the Green Bay Police Department reported six homicides and a 17% decrease in assault offenses, which included gun violence.
In its 2024 crime report, the department reported four fewer homicides, but also reported a rise in crimes against persons of around 18%. Some of the offenses that led to the increase included aggravated assault, simple assault and kidnapping/abduction. 
The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform partnered with Green Bay Police and other local community corrections agencies to study shootings and homicides in Green Bay between 2019 and 2021. The analysis found that in Green Bay “most gun violence is tightly concentrated on a small number of very high risk young Black male adults that share a common set of risk factors.” 
These risk factors included involvement in street crews/groups and significant criminal justice history, according to the analysis. The analysis found that shootings were often caused by a “petty conflict over a young woman, a simple argument, or a feud on social media.” People involved in groups or gangs were also involved in a range of other criminal activities, such as selling drugs or robbery, which made them more likely to be involved in violence. 
One of the report’s recommendations was that the city of Green Bay should invest in development and expansion of community-based violence intervention services.
Kressin said the Office of Violence Prevention has played a part in contributing to a short-term reduction in the number of homicides as well as shots-fired incidents in the community. 
When a violent incident happens and has the potential to lead to retaliation in the community, a primary role of the office is to intervene, Kressin said. She also said the office has built partnerships with community organizations, participated in community events, hosted community conversations in Spanish and English and knocked on doors. 
Fisher said the Green Bay Police Department shares information with the Office of Violence Prevention. The department can give information to Kressin, and the office can make a plan to get involved. The goal is to minimize and defuse a situation so they don’t have to contact the police, but the office will contact the police to avoid someone getting hurt, Fisher said. 
The new location includes a recording studio, lending library, video production tools and interactive workshops aimed at building life skills in collaboration with community organizations, the office said in a statement. 
Kressin said participants can learn about music production and build relationships with violence interrupters. One of the interrupters is working with podcasting and videography, and the Office of Violence Prevention is getting started with the rollout, she said. 
Green Bay Police Chief Chris Davis was one of the speakers at the grand opening’s press conference. 
“Our police officers in our organization have been able to make some really great relationships, and a lot of us, myself included, have been able to see tangible results in real people’s lives as a result of that work together,” Davis said. “And so we’re looking forward to what the future holds for this program and for this community.”

Today is Tax Day – the day the political right – lazily and predictably – likes to use as a crutch for blasting government.
What all of us would do well to recall today, however, is where we would be without taxes and the essential services they provide that make civilized society possible.
And we should also remember two huge failings of the North Carolina tax system that are the handiwork of political conservatives:
First, is the regressive nature of our state tax structure – a system in which the wealthy pay vastly lower rates than people of middle and lower incomes.
And second, is the way that repeated regressive tax cuts of the past 15 years are starving core public services – so much so that total spending on things like schools and infrastructure in North Carolina has plunged by nearly 40%.
The bottom line: No one loves paying taxes, and our system is far from perfect, but when Americans buy into lazy and simplistic anti-tax narratives, average people play right into the hands of the wealthy forces who’ve been rigging the system.

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/15/nonprofits-report-calls-for-broad-based-approach-to-improving-reading-scores/,"Consistent funding for teachers' programs is just one of the recommendations in a report out Tuesday morning from Maryland READS, a nonprofit focused on improved reading instruction, but it says there are nonfinancial remedies as well.","Alex Arianna during a reading lesson at Lincoln Elementary School. (Photo courtesy Frederick County Public Schools)Alice Tickler tries to stay positive when it comes to educating young children, but the longtime teacher admits there are some things that can make it hard — and it’s not anything the students do.
Things like the legislature’s failure to fund a training program, specifically for reading and math teachers. As a teacher for 28 years, she’s seen the benefits of what educators call a “coaching program” can have.
“Seeing other teachers in action, having a mentor teacher that knows how to teach reading alongside of you or coaching you, that’s huge,” said Tickler, a first-grade teacher in Queen Anne’s County public schools. “That coaching model would really benefit teachers.”
Tickler’s comments echo recommendations in a report being released Tuesday morning by Maryland READS, a nonprofit focused on the improvement of reading instruction. Providing consistent funding for teachers is just one of the recommendations in “The State of Reading in Maryland 2025: It’s Time for a Comeback after a Decade of Decline.”
While the General Assembly approved the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act last week without funding for a training program, it did approve funding for a national teacher recruitment campaign and a $2,000 relocation grant to “incentivize an out-of-state licensed teacher to move to the state.”
The report’s not all about funding, however, and acknowledges the state’s financial difficulties. Similar to a report produced last year, Tuesday’s document outlines recommendations to improve literacy, such as businesses providing employees time to serve as local tutors, and state and local leaders organizing town halls on digital education for families.
Because of the state’s fiscal challenges, the report suggests philanthropists provide financial and other resources to help create “thriving, reading ecosystems.”
  A chart shows per pupil spending increased in comparison to test scores for fourth- and eighth-grade students in Maryland. (Chart courtesy of Maryland READS)
According to the report, per pupil spending increased by 37% since 2013 through last year. During that time, National Assessment of Educational Progress math scores have constantly declined.
“Everything the state has done to put a system of support in place … gives us hope,” Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS, said in an interview. “But I think the legislature needs to get on board a little bit more and trust her [State Superintendent Carey Wright] leadership because she has a proven track record, and I don’t think they did that this time around.”
‘Make sure children can read’
Tuesday’s document notes a report last year from the National Council on Teacher Quality. It gave Maryland and 19 other states an overall “moderate” rating on teacher training programs based on five policy actions to strengthen implementation of the “science of reading,” which Wright utilized as public schools leader in Mississippi and pushed to incorporate in Maryland.
The council gave three ratings – strong, moderate and weak – not only for the total assessment of training programs, but also separate reviews of each policy action. On the policy statement, “Reviews teacher-preparation programs to ensure they teach the Science of Reading,” Maryland received a “weak” rating.
Maryland READS recommends the state Department of Education “should immediately exercise authority, including limiting grants and contracts, and hold Maryland teacher preparation programs accountable for aligning to Science of Reading by 2028.”
According to the report, what will help teachers with literacy instruction is an agreement the department made last year to implement a four-year, $6.8 million grant from the nonprofit Ibis Group of Washington, D.C.
About $5.3 million of that grant will be used for free online training in the science of reading for at least 30,000 paraprofessionals, teachers and other staff. The remaining $1.5 million would be for Johns Hopkins University and the department to research the impact of teacher efficacy, teacher background knowledge and literacy.
But Brennan-Gac said additional and consistent support is needed.
“Having a coach in the classroom actually helps the teacher change their practice,” Brennan-Gac said. “While it’s wonderful that we’ve brought these training programs into the state, [but] if they don’t get the coaching, we’re not really leveraging that wonderful resource we have and this whole movement that we’re doing.”
Some other recommendations from the report to improve literacy include:

Starting July 1, the department should collaborate with educators and organizations to begin work on drafting an adolescent literacy policy;
The legislature should tie future funding to data related to proficiency rates at community schools, those that receive high concentration of poverty grants which provide a variety of wraparound and other services; and
State, local and community leaders should educate parents and guardians on limiting the use of electronic devices for their children.

“We should do everything that we can to make sure that our children can read,” said Tickler, who serves on a statewide teacher advisory council created by the department this year. “We don’t want our children to enter that pipeline that takes them to jail or drugs. We want our kids to be successful and we want our kids to be literate.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Teacher-with-look-sign-scaled-1-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-04-15 08:08:21.733591

(Photo: Alex Kent)A GOP bill giving law enforcement expanded arrest powers during public protests and police actions is drawing pushback from civil rights and journalist groups as a potential infringement on First Amendment rights. 
The multi-part bill (HB55/SB30) by Tennessee House Leader William Lamberth of Portland and Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon — both Republicans — would allow police to order members of the media and public to remain 25 feet away from crime scenes, traffic stops and any “ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.”
The proposed legislation would also give police added enforcement powers during public protests and demonstrations. 
The bill redefines the crime of “littering” to include the distribution of flyers with the “intent to to unlawfully intimidate,” criminalizes the hanging of banners and signs over bridges and tunnels and allows police to make misdemeanor arrests of protestors identified through social media videos. 
The bill additionally gives law enforcement the right to demand a person’s name based on “reasonable suspicion of a legal violation.”
In a letter to lawmakers Monday, more than two dozen groups representing Tennessee Muslim, Jewish, Black and immigrant groups, and civil liberties advocates, warned the legislation is “likely to have a chilling effect” on a spectrum of communities seeking to make their voices heard in response to public policy decisions. 
“We are living in a period in which constitutional rights and physical safety are at increased risk with federal workers, students, LGBTQ+ immigrant, Jewish, Muslim and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities caught in the crosshairs,” their letter noted.  The “real world impact” of the proposed legislation would infringe on the fundamental right of speech and assembly, the groups said. 










There’s a million-and-a-half reasons why reporters need to be in close proximity to law enforcement to do their own job. This gives police far too much discretion to shut that reporting down.


– Grayson Clary, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press


Media organizations have also opposed the legislation.
“As you can imagine, journalists appear within 25 feet of law enforcement officers doing their day job every day,” said Grayson Clary, staff attorney with Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides legal support to journalists. 
“Maybe it’s a crime scene, a protest, a police response to a rally when it takes a turn,” he said. “There’s a million-and-a-half reasons why reporters need to be in close proximity to law enforcement to do their own job. This gives police far too much discretion to shut that reporting down.”
Similar legislation in Indiana and Louisiana creating buffer zones between police and the public, including the media, have been preliminarily halted by federal courts, Clary noted. Both laws are currently in the federal appeals process. 
Pody told lawmakers last week that the intent of a 25-foot buffer line around police is not to keep the public from observing police actions, but to protect the work of law enforcement.
“They can still be witnessed. They can still be videotaped,” Pody said. “I think that law enforcement is not opposed to anything like that. We still want them to be held accountable…We’re just saying there’s a 25 foot radius if (police) are actively doing something where they need to be focused on the job.”
But Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat, noted that requiring the public to be 25 feet away could keep police actions out of view. She cited the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police – an event captured on bystander video.
“The flaw in this part (of Tennessee’s bill) is it doesn’t give citizens the ability to exercise their First Amendment right and catch that,” she said. “And it opens up the door to police misconduct, and it shields them from citizens having the evidence of police misconduct.”
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis cited “bridge bandits, intersection imbeciles and interstate insurrectionists” disrupting roadways in his district for his support of the bill.
In response to questions from Taylor, a Tennessee Highway Patrol attorney confirmed that, should the bill become law, protestors in Memphis who appear in social media images blocking roadways and bridges could be arrested by state troopers even if Memphis police declined to make arrests.

The bill’s origins lie with action taken by the Metro Nashville Council last year in response to several anti-semitic and racist demonstrations by white supremacist and neo-Nazis in downtown Nashville. 
The largely Democratic council voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing four ordinances aimed at hate speech and those who promote it, including buffer zones around public buildings, a ban on highway banners and a provision banning the transport of individuals in the back of a box truck —  the way some white supremacist protestors arrived in Nashville last summers. 
Tennessee Republicans, Nashville mayor back antisemitism bill

Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell and others in Metro government worked with Republicans to craft the current legislation and its backers have cited the need to stem a rise in anti-semitic demonstrations.
“While addressing anti-Semitism is a shared and important concern, these bills include sweeping provisions with dangerous and far-reaching consequences that compromise free speech, public safety, and the principles of equitable justice,” said Sabina Mohyuddin, executive director of the Nashville-based American Muslim Advisory Council, which opposes the bill along with Bend the Arc Jewish Action, Latino Memphis, Nashville Jews for Justice and the NAACP Nashville branch.
“In today’s political climate—where immigrant and pro-Palestinian voices are increasingly targeted—this legislation raises grave concerns,” she said.
The Tennessee Senate adopted the bill 30-2 Monday. In the House, the bill will be considered after debate over the state budget.

(Photo courtesy of Liz Cartwright)Of all the issues surrounding the Ukraine-Russia conflict, one really stands out for me — the thousands of children who have been abducted by Russian troops and sent to re-education camps and adoptive families all over Russia. There are currently 19,546 cases on file of abducted children. These children are being forcibly held in Russia, and they are not able to contact their families back in Ukraine.
I was in Washington, D.C., at the Ukraine Action Summit (April 6-9, 2025) as part of the Idaho Delegation, along with Lena and Scott Contor and Eric Medina. All 50 states were represented at the summit and over 600 individuals attended. Attendees were Ukrainians by birth, by ancestry and by choice; I’m one of the latter.

At its core, the purpose of the summit was informational, and the information coming out of some of the best universities in the U.S. points to a huge number of Ukrainian children who have been caught up in this conflict. 
According to the Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab,  “The February 2023 report found that more than 6,000 children between the ages of four months and 17 years had been transported to 43 Russian-operated camps and facilities since the launch of Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.”  Recent updates, using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data triangulated with social media posts and other open source information show that the abductions are continuing; a small percentage of the children have been located and returned while many others continue to disappear. 
Ukrainian children are held in several different situations after being abducted by Russian soldiers, according to Nathaniel Raymond of the Yale School of Public Health. 
They are held in re-education camps, they are taken from orphanages where many are temporarily being lodged even though they have family, they are taken directly off the battlefields by Russian soldiers, and they are split apart from their families while in detention centers. 
Under the Geneva Convention, children in this situation must be registered with the Red Cross, they need to be allowed to call home to let their families know how they are doing, and they need to be taken to a neutral country and out of harms way until they can be reunited. None of these conditions of safety are currently being met. 
According to the organization Bring Kids Back, under the direction of the President of the Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, there are currently 19,546 children who have been abducted; only 1,269 of those have been returned to their Ukrainian families. 
International humanitarian law defines these acts of abduction as kidnapping, the children must be returned without conditions. They are not pawns. 
In Idaho, our communities have been welcoming and supportive of Ukrainians coming to the U.S. from this war.  We have had fundraisers for Ukrainian refugees and for general support to those Ukrainians living in combat zone. 
In addition to the daily dangers and horrors of war, thousands of Ukrainian families are experiencing the terrible nightmare of not knowing where their children are amidst the ongoing violence. Child abduction is another facet of a conflict that needs to be resolved by securing a permanent peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia.

Tennessee lawmakers could spend $6 million to audit Memphis Shelby County Schools as a potential forerunner to a state “takeover” of the district.
Senate finance committee Chairman Bo Watson confirmed Monday another $3 million for a forensic audit was placed in the Senate’s $59.6 billion budget plan to go with $3 million in Gov. Bill Lee’s supplemental budget amendment.
Senators also placed $4.5 million in the budget plan to expand Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s special litigation unit, which previously was tasked with opposing former President Joe Biden’s policies.
When the 2025 session started, Republican lawmakers started discussing appointment of a state management board that would supersede the elected Memphis Shelby County School Board. Memphis residents testified against the bill.

The proposal hasn’t gained a foothold yet, but lawmakers appear bent on auditing the school district even though the Comptroller’s Office conducts school system audits.
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Shelby County Republican, said Monday the audit is needed to start a deeper look at the school district.
“That kind of money spent on that kind of audit, that’s the kind of audit that somebody goes to the pokey over, and this is something that’s been building for decades, and it’s time we finally take the bull by the horns,” Taylor said. He didn’t pinpoint any wrongdoing on the part of Memphis Shelby County Schools officials.
Taylor, who is sponsoring the bill to make major changes in the district, said lawmakers shied away from a takeover because of problems with the Achievement School District, which is being abolished because it failed to make major improvements over a decade in spite of a billion dollars in expenses. The bill’s wording remains in talks, though, and an advisory board could be placed in the measure, he said.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville, a member of the finance committee, called the pending expenditure “ridiculous.”
“The purpose of our school funding is to educate children, not to create ammunition for some garbage political fights,” Yarbro said.
Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis has been pushing for change this session to deal with what he calls “a decades-old issue of underperformance.”










The purpose of our school funding is to educate children, not to create ammunition for some garbage political fights.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


His bill contains a provision to put a nine-member management group appointed by the state in charge of operating the school district, giving it authority over the locally-elected school board and administrators. 
Taylor’s version isn’t quite as restrictive but puts the state in charge by allowing Tennessee’s education commissioner, with approval from the Department of Education, to remove the schools director or school board members and allow the county commission to replace them. If a school district goes through three district directors in three years, a county mayor could appoint a new director for a four-year term.
The Senate bill also would lift income caps on the Education Savings Account in effect in Shelby County, the governor’s initial private-school voucher program, and change the process for a public school to become a charter school.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)In the more than two years that Colorado has accepted cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes, the amount Coloradans have submitted using the new form of payment is essentially nonexistent.
The Colorado Department of Revenue in September 2022 started accepting cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for all state taxes, including income tax, business income tax, sales and use taxes, and severance tax. The move was spearheaded with fanfare by Gov. Jared Polis.
State acceptance of digital currency is “important symbolically to show that we are a crypto-forward state,” Polis said when he announced the new feature, according to Westword.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In the four months that remained that year after the program went live, the state received eight cryptocurrency payments for a total of $16,426, according to state data obtained by Newsline.
In 2023, the state received 22 cryptocurrency payments for a total of $23,241, and in 2024 it received 48 payments for a total of $17,544.
The state typically takes in many billions of dollars a year in tax revenues. In fiscal year 2022-23, for example, it received $11 billion in individual income tax alone. The sum of all cryptocurrency the state received through the end of 2024 represents 0.006% of that figure.
“Colorado was the first state to innovate and accept cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes under the leadership of Governor Jared Polis,” Elizabeth Kosar, director of communications of the Colorado Department of Revenue, said in an email.
Kosar noted that Colorado doesn’t actually accept cryptocurrency. When taxpayers pay the state with cryptocurrency, they submit the payment through the PayPal Cryptocurrencies Hub, which converts the digital money to U.S. dollars before it’s sent to the state.
Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tout the digital asset as being supported by a decentralized system free of government regulation or manipulation. Critics note that crypto is often used to facilitate money laundering, illicit trade and corruption. It also contributes to environmental degradation, and it’s subject to price manipulation and wild volatility. Just over a month after Polis announced Colorado’s move to accept digital currency, the crypto market crashed and Bitcoin lost 70% of its value.
State taxes, as well as federal taxes, are due Tuesday.

Prosecutors later dropped the charge against her. (by Micaela Watts)
This story was originally published by The Institute for Public Service Reporting Memphis. 
Memphis simmered in the July heat as a police cruiser pulled over a blue Nissan Altima motoring through the downtown business district. The car’s temporary tag had expired days earlier, an oversight police often resolve by issuing a citation.
But this traffic stop took a more serious turn when a Memphis Police Department officer said he “could smell an odor consistent with marijuana coming out of the vehicle.’’
After questioning a female passenger, police found slightly more than a half-ounce of marijuana in her purse — a small but critical amount that led officers to arrest the family-focused grandmother on a felony drug-trafficking charge.
As a special task force begins reviewing U.S. Justice Department claims of abuse by MPD during traffic stops, reform advocates say the woman’s arrest is yet another example of overly aggressive policing in Memphis.
“It’s absolutely a trumped-up charge,” said Claiborne Ferguson, a longtime Memphis defense attorney who reviewed the July 2, 2024, police affidavit filed against the woman. He has no official connection to the case.
The woman, a cancer victim, said she is no drug dealer and doesn’t even smoke that much.
“It was crazy,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified. Although the charge against her was later dropped, she said she fears any association with a criminal charge. “I’m a real-life good person. I treat everyone with respect,” she said.
The incident is one of 13 traffic-stop cases identified by the Institute for Public Service Reporting in which Shelby County law enforcement officers signed felony marijuana affidavits, only to see those charges vacated in court. Attorneys who reviewed the affidavits for The Institute said they appeared deficient in supporting felony charges of intent to sell.
The charges — which often involved warrantless searches of vehicles — led arrestees to spend several hours or more in jail.
“I lost my job,” said Dominique Hodges, 26, who was arrested in December. Prosecutors dropped the charges in February, but not before she spent a terrifying night at Jail East, Shelby County’s women’s holding facility, and paid $700 in attorney fees and costs. She said the charges hanging over her caused her to lose a good-paying maintenance job.
“I cried and I cried,’’ she said of her trip to jail. There, jailers conducted an invasive search, she said. Later, Hodges watched in fear as an irate arrestee hit her fist against a wall over and over. “I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy,’’ she said.
Among the 13 arrestees, 12 were Black, including Hodges and the grandmother.
All the arrests were made after officers said they smelled marijuana and either requested consent to search or used the smell as probable cause to search vehicles without consent.
The 13 arrests included ten by MPD, two by the Sheriff’s Office and one by the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
Both MPD and the Highway Patrol declined comment. The Sheriff’s Office didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

 Broad police discretion

The Institute identified the 13 cases while reviewing eight months of arrest data, including a six-month stretch between last April and September and a follow-up two-month stretch in December and January to assess patterns following the release of the Justice Department’s critical Dec. 4 report.
Traffic stops reviewed by The Institute followed a general pattern: Motorists were pulled over for a missing headlight or taillight, tinted windows, expired or missing tags, failing to wear a seat belt and occasionally for speeding or running a red light.
Officers then searched vehicles after saying they smelled marijuana.
Simple possession of small amounts of marijuana is a misdemeanor in Tennessee, which remains among a slim minority of states that haven’t legalized medicinal or recreational marijuana. In Shelby County, where marijuana prosecutions have been deprioritized, police can issue a misdemeanor citation for simple possession without making an arrest. At times, officers take no action at all when stopping motorists with small amounts of marijuana, according to interviews conducted by The Institute.
But a felony charge brings a guaranteed trip to jail.
Police generally have broad discretion when making arrests. Probable cause to arrest requires a lower threshold of evidence than proof required at trial, and police tend to charge suspects at the highest level available, defense attorneys said.

The case for pretextual traffic stops

Attorneys who reviewed arrest affidavits for The Institute said some appeared to be borderline cases or “close calls” in establishing probable cause for a felony charge. In one case, a motorist charged with felony intent to sell was found with a small amount of marijuana and three guns, including a semi-automatic rifle. Records suggest it was a difficult matter to sort out: All the guns turned out to be legal. Tennessee doesn’t require permits to carry guns, and it allows most people other than individuals convicted of felonies to freely transport them in cars.
Such incidents require quick judgments often made under high-stress conditions, police say.
“It’s very tough because you don’t know what’s in that car,’’ said Mike Williams, a former patrolman and past president of the Memphis Police Association, a labor union. “I couldn’t imagine me personally being out there in the streets right now … because everybody has a damn gun. And a lot of these young people that are running around with these guns, they’re not afraid to use them.”

The case against pretextual traffic stops


But reform advocates say there is a delicate balance between protecting public safety and eroding community trust. Even if a charge is later dismissed, arrests often pose hardships including job loss along with stiff fees and court costs. Often, vehicles are seized.
“So now because I get caught with this … I have to hire a lawyer. I have to go pay a bond. Get probation,’’ said Keedran Franklin, a criminal justice reform advocate who contends police often target people of color. “That … may put me $30,000 in debt.’’
Overall, African-Americans represented 89 of 93 Shelby County defendants (96 percent) identified by The Institute as having been arrested between last April and September after officers said they smelled marijuana. Many of the traffic stops, which often led to charges unconnected to marijuana possession, were clustered in African-American neighborhoods in Orange Mound, Frayser, Hickory Hill and South and North Memphis.

MPD’s focus on saturation patrols in “high-crime” neighborhoods and the potential for harassment alarmed Justice Department officials, who noted in the Dec. 4 report that Memphis police stopped one Black man 30 times in three years.
Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy said police need discretion when making arrests but conceded that evidence at times can’t support felony charges.
“It is not at all uncommon for the police to bring us a charge for felony intent to sell marijuana and we reduce it to a misdemeanor. And largely that’s not necessarily because we’re saying that the police overcharged but because there is a difference between the amount of evidence you need for probable cause to arrest and the amount of evidence you need to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt at trial,” Mulroy said.
“So, I’m not going to use a heavily charged word like abuse, but I will say that given the fact that the arrest itself can be disruptive to someone’s life, and given that it seems like this particular charge seems disproportionately targeted on the African-American community … one can see how a really aggressive posture of arresting and charging felonies for what may simply be simple marijuana possession can be problematic. It may be something that maybe this task force can look at.”
The task force he refers to was formed when Mayor Paul Young tapped former federal appeals court judge Bernice Donald to review Justice Department allegations outlined in its Dec. 4 report. The 70-page report found MPD often conducts unlawful stops and searches, discriminates against Black people and uses excessive force.

Small amounts, big charges
It was three days before Christmas, and Dominque Hodges was out partying with friends. They took her battered Chrysler Sebring, though she was riding as a passenger that night. When police spotted the car — missing rear bumper, burned-out front headlight, invalid drive-out tags — they pulled it over.
“They snatched me out of the car,’’ Hodges recalled.
According to her arrest affidavit, police searched the car after smelling marijuana and found a bag containing 18 grams, roughly enough to roll 18 to 36 marijuana cigarettes. Hodges said she admitted the pot was hers, arguing that she’s a smoker not a dealer.
“I’m telling them, ‘Why am I going to jail for this little bit … Look, my mom is sick. I don’t have nobody that’s going to come and bail me out of jail.’ ’’
Under Tennessee law, a person who possesses a half-ounce (14.175 grams) or more of marijuana with the intent to manufacture, sell or deliver is guilty of a felony punishable by 11 months to 60 years in prison depending on the amount and an individual’s prior record. Selling less than a half-ounce is a misdemeanor.
But defense attorneys say many officers don’t seem to understand that simple possession — even in amounts greater than 14.175 grams — is still a misdemeanor if the defendant lacked intent to sell.
“I have regularly heard officers and prosecutors say more than ½ (ounce) is a ‘felony amount’ but that is incorrect,’’ said Ben Raybin, a Nashville-based defense and civil rights attorney. “There still has to be an intent to sell, deliver, or manufacture.’’
Courts have ruled that to prove intent, authorities need evidence of something more than mere weight. They need other supporting details such as finding marijuana packaged in multiple baggies, large amounts of cash, firearms, ledgers, digital scales or other indicators of a drug sale.
Yet repeatedly, records show, officers arrest motorists on charges of felony intent to sell marijuana with scant supporting evidence of an indication to sell — charges that are later vacated in court. The cases reviewed by The Institute were dropped by prosecutors via an action known as nolle prosequi, or the abandonment of a criminal charge.
In the July 2, 2024, arrest of the grandmother in Downtown Memphis, for example, police reported finding 16.1 grams in her purse. In an affidavit of complaint sworn out before a judicial magistrate, police listed no other evidence indicating an intent to sell. The woman was booked into Jail East, Shelby County’s detention facility for female arrestees. The charge was later dropped.
“I don’t see the slightest hint of evidence that she possessed it with the intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell it, so in my opinion this should have been charged (with) a misdemeanor rather than a felony,’’ Raybin wrote in an email. “If that was her only charge (it was), she should have been given a citation rather than placed under a custodial arrest.”
Defendants charged with misdemeanors often are cited and released without being booked into jail. In some instances of simple marijuana possession, officers don’t even do that much, some allege.
“Most of the times (when) we get stopped, the police put the weed right back in the car,” Hodges said.
Recently retired General Sessions Court Judge Bill Anderson said that he’s heard similar accounts.
“It’s gotten out to the rank-and-file police on the street that the DA is not prosecuting small amounts of marijuana,’’ Anderson said. “These officers … don’t like coming to court. They don’t like wasting their time having to write report after report. So if it’s a small amount, what I understand they’re doing is just throwing it away or telling them, open it up, throw it out on the street or something.”
Overall, officers seize relatively small amounts of marijuana when making traffic stops on Memphis streets.
Among the 93 odor-triggered arrests identified by The Institute, the median amount of marijuana confiscated was 20 grams. That’s roughly enough to roll 20 to 40 marijuana cigarettes.
Studies suggest traffic stops like these aren’t effective in reducing overall crime rates, but they can accumulate significant arrests. During one day three-day stretch in June, The Institute found, MPD arrested at least ten people after smelling marijuana, including five with violent arrest histories and another with glassy eyes and slow reactions who was charged with driving while intoxicated by marijuana.
In those 10 arrests, police confiscated two assault-style rifles and a Glock 17 handgun with a switch that converted it to a rapid-fire machinegun and three other pistols.
 Questions surround MPD’s supervision and training

Marijuana grown today is much more potent — and pungent — than in years past. Its smell wafts across Memphis, emanating from cars, seats at Tiger football games, street corners and alleyways.
Still, attorneys interviewed for this story said they believe police at times manufacture claims that they smelled marijuana as a pretext to create probable cause to search a vehicle.
The Justice Department report articulated similar concerns.
“While officers often justify vehicle and pedestrian searches based on statements that they have smelled the ‘odor of marijuana,’ courts and MPD’s own internal affairs unit has found that those justifications are not always credible,’’ the report said.
“… A prosecutor described MPD’s explanations as sometimes ‘cringey,’ and gave the example of an officer claiming to have smelled marijuana in a car that was going 60 miles per hour.”
It’s difficult to assess how widespread the problem may be.

“The problem is I don’t know (the full extent of) the abuses because nobody’s forcing them to keep up any records of when they search a vehicle saying they smelled marijuana and not finding anything,” Ferguson said.
Again, the Justice Department articulated similar concerns.
“This data does not include hundreds of thousands of traffic stops that did not result in citations, because MPD officers do not document the reason for those stops,” the report said.
But the report was unequivocal in stating that MPD engages in a pattern of illegal traffic stops, arrests and evidence collection in violation of the Fourth Amendment that protects citizens against unreasonable search and seizure.
“The pattern of Fourth Amendment violations stems from MPD’s decision to prioritize traffic enforcement as a central method to address crime in Memphis, while at the same time failing to ensure that officers understand and follow constitutional requirements when they stop and detain people,’’ said the report, which followed an 18-month investigation launched after the January 2023 police beating death of motorist Tyre Nichols.
“…Supervisors rarely review traffic stops to ensure they meet constitutional standards. But they do measure officers’ ‘productivity’ based in part on how many stops and citations they generate.’’
Ferguson said he believes MPD’s struggles stem from either poor training or coaching by supervising lieutenants.
“It’s either bad training or it’s purposeful malicious prosecution in order to seize vehicles. That’s all it can be,’’ Ferguson said. “Either they’re completely not training these officers or they train them specifically to do this to get into the car.”
The Justice Department report raised similar concerns.
“Officers will, for example, write in reports that they smelled marijuana, but there will be no mention of the odor of marijuana on body-worn camera footage,’’ the report said.
Such a scenario played out in federal court last year when prosecutors dismissed gun charges against Cedric Jackson, now 33, after inconsistencies arose between police reports and body camera footage.
Officers wrote in an October 2022 affidavit that they “observed a green residue consistent with Marijuana’’ on the console of Jackson’s Chevy Tahoe. Citing that as probable cause to search the vehicle, officers found a Smith & Wesson handgun that Jackson, a convicted felon, could not legally possess.

“I am having trouble with the search,’’ U.S. District Court Judge Thomas L. Parker said in a Jan. 4, 2024, hearing after reviewing bodycam footage. “… If they were relying on noticing the residue of marijuana on the console, I didn’t hear anybody say so at the time. I watched several videos and so I did not … see a lot of discussion about that. There were no photographs of the residue on the console area, so the Court finds that the Government did not carry its burden to show that that was the basis for a search.’’
Though Parker later dismissed a defense motion to suppress evidence seized in the search, finding the items would have been detected later in a routine inventory search of the car, the case’s credibility appeared shaken by defense challenges. Parker eventually approved a motion by prosecutors to dismiss the case.
Asked why prosecutors moved to dismiss the case, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Memphis declined comment.
Evolving marijuana laws
Odor-related searches have grown complicated in Tennessee, in part because of law changes in other states. Tennessee is one of just 11 states where recreational or medicinal marijuana use hasn’t been legalized, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Yet motorists on Memphis’ streets may be carrying medicinal marijuana bought across the river in Arkansas or across the border in Mississippi. Recreational marijuana can be purchased via a short, 90-minute drive into southern Missouri.
“Now (when they return to Memphis) they’re presumed to be a felony drug dealer,’’ said defense lawyer Michael Working. “… You’re coming back with more than 14.175 grams every time. It’s like, you know, you don’t go to Arkansas to buy legal beer and buy (just) one can of beer.”
In Shelby County, simple possession of small amounts of marijuana often is tolerated.
District Attorney Mulroy said simple possession prosecutions had been de-prioritized by his predecessor, Amy Weirich, though the practice varied among individual prosecutors, he said.
“I think it’s more uniform now (in) that it is not a priority,” Mulroy said. “We still enforce it. I mean, it’s the law, right? We enforce it. But we’ve got so many more important things to focus on, like violent crime.” Though there is “no blanket rule,” misdemeanor marijuana cases can lead to community service followed by a dismissal of the charges, he said.

Consequently, police often won’t bring misdemeanor cases, defense attorneys said. What’s emerged is a sort of felony-or-nothing situation. And as courts have trimmed back on Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, the smell of marijuana as justification to search a vehicle has become all but impossible for defendants to overcome, defense attorneys say.
But a Tennessee Supreme Court ruling last summer may change some of the ground rules for marijuana-related traffic stops.
In that case, state of Tennessee vs. Andre Jujuan Lee Green, the court ruled that the smell of marijuana alone is not enough for a search, finding that officers must consider “the totality of the circumstances” before conducting a warrantless search.
The case originates from Clarksville, Tennessee, where officers used a drug-sniffing dog to find an ounce of marijuana, a gun and baggies during a February 2020 traffic stop. Defense attorneys argued the search was improper because a police dog can’t tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. Both are varieties of the same species. Congress legalized hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill and Tennessee followed suit in 2019.
The court rejected a defense motion to dismiss the case. Although it found that “the legalization of hemp has added a degree of ambiguity to a dog’s positive alert,” it ruled the search was merited by a totality of circumstances that included “suspicious answers” that the car’s occupants gave to officers’ questions and a backpack seen in plain view inside the car. Both the car’s driver and passenger denied ownership of the backpack.
Raybin said the Green case means officers will no longer be able to conduct probable cause searches of vehicles based solely on the odor of marijuana.
“In my opinion that is directly precluded by the Green case and everything should be thrown out,’’ said Raybin, who co-authored a friend-of-the-court brief in support of dismissing charges in the case.
How much actual impact the ruling will have remains to be seen, however. Officers don’t need much in the way of additional factors to justify a search, Raybin said. It can involve something as simple as a defendant appearing nervous, “sweating profusely” or making inconsistent statements.
“…It still won’t take too much’’ to justify a search, Raybin said.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The regular session of the West Virginia Legislature ended Saturday night, but not before there was one last big fight that gave the majority a chance to show their disdain for West Virginians who don’t look like them. 
The biggest fight of the final night — if not the whole session — was Senate Bill 474, legislation to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the state.
Republicans seem to see DEI as hiring someone who is unqualified and not white over the most qualified white candidate in the world. Or maybe they just assume someone who is not white isn’t qualified, no matter the truth.
In reality, DEI gives an even playing field for women, people of color, veterans and people with disabilities in the work force. It makes places more diverse because diversity is critical in all workplaces.
Dems tried their hardest to run the time out on the bill in the House Saturday night. Dels. Sean Hornbuckle, Anitra Hamilton and Hollis Lewis — the only Black members of the West Virginia Legislature — all gave speeches about why DEI is important.
Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, asked Republican lawmakers what problem the bill was trying to solve. He was given a vague answer about there being “divisions” in schools, offices, policies and programs in the state, and the bill will eliminate those “divisions.”
“Mr. Speaker, I rise and guess I can’t really say I’m surprised, because we’ve talked about this for a while, but I’m shocked that several in the body would continue with this Boogeyman,” Hornbuckle said. “I’m a little bit confused as well, little bit angry. I don’t think there’s a problem. I know there’s not a problem. We’re scurrying around here like never before to get a bill passed, so much so that you would think it was a landmark piece of legislation to create hundreds of jobs.”
There were no landmark pieces of legislation that created hundreds of jobs passed during this session.
Hornbuckle also questioned Republicans who felt they had to vote for the bill.
“There’s a couple people in here that are friends of mine, and as a Black man — how I operate, I’m gonna be friends with you after this vote … and you’re gonna tell me, ‘I had to do it, man. I don’t believe in it, but I had to do it. I had to do it.’ You didn’t have to do nothing. For what? The seat? Is a seat that important?”
I don’t know how any of the 87 Republicans who still voted to ban DEI after the delegates explained the adversity they face daily will be able to look Hornbuckle, Hamilton and Lewis in the eye after Saturday.
Hamilton, D-Monongalia, also gave a passionate speech explaining why diversity is so important, as the only Black woman in the entire Legislature.
“We tell the state every day that you’re not welcome here. You’re welcome to work here, but your voice don’t matter. We want your work. We want your money, but your equity and your worth don’t matter. That’s the kind of message that we send.”
Last year was Hamilton’s first year in the Legislature. She was appointed to fill Danielle Walker’s seat after she resigned.
“Do y’all know that last year, when I came here for the first three months, I had to tell everybody that I’m Danielle Walker, because I had to make sure that you guys could embrace me …” Hamilton said. “ … Do you also know, last year —  have any of y’all ever been stopped at the door and not allowed to come in? Have you? I was stopped at a public meeting and asked, ‘Can I help you?’ I said, ‘No.’ ‘Do you need help?’ ‘No, I do not.’ …  I had a seat at the table and still have to explain why I deserve to be in the room. It happens all the time.”
Hamilton also explained the importance of representation.
“How would you feel if you went to class and they have erased your entire history out of the history books? How would you feel? How would you feel if you went to work and nobody on your job looked like you? Would it give you hope? No, it wouldn’t. You would have to find hope within yourself to say, ‘I still belong,’ and then try to be representation, and fight for a state that don’t fight for you.”
Lewis, D-Kanawha, spoke on what this bill will do to limit teachers by requiring they also teach alternative theories.
“What’s the alternative theory to slavery?” he asked. “What’s the alternative theory to why West Virginia succeeded from Virginia and joined the Union? What alternative are we offering? What we’re doing is we’re handcuffing our educators so they’re not going to want to teach these sort of things.”
Lewis looked back on how little he learned about the history of Black West Virginians in public school. He talked about how, even though he went to the same college as Katherine Johnson, he didn’t know about her until the movie “Hidden Figures” came out.
“I can remember sitting in the class for months after months after months, and I didn’t learn anything about myself. You would have thought that me and my family and the people I knew were the only Black people to ever be in West Virginia.”
Hamilton really gave the perfect summary of this Republican supermajority’s hypocrisy:
“Isn’t it something that we trust teachers with concealed weapons, but we can’t trust our teachers to teach history?” Hamilton said.
After nearly three hours of debate in the House, the bill passed at 10:41 p.m., and moved to the Senate.
When the bill advanced to the Senate, 13 amendments from Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, appeared to be pending on the legislation — a tactic to run out the clock to keep the bill from passing.
However, Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, made a motion to suspend legislative Joint Rule 3 — a rule that governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers. That motion was adopted and the Senate then concurred with and passed the House’s version of the bill 31-2 without any consideration of Garcia’s amendments.
In an interview afterward, Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, said he also didn’t quite understand the legislative procedures that led to the passage of SB 474. Garcia said the Republican used “dirty tricks” to get the bill passed.
As a white woman, who has not experienced the discrimination that Hamilton, Hornbuckle and Lewis deal with, I can’t explain as well as they did how damaging this bill will be. But Hamilton, Hornbuckle and Lewis’ appeal to their colleagues’ better nature and sense of justice was ignored. 
Republicans in our Legislature need to stop ignoring scientists and experts to blindly follow whatever President Donald Trump has ordered. They need to stop ignoring people who don’t look like them. They need to listen to people who live and work here.

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
 ‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.












There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.

CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
 Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Following the passage of a Kentucky law that eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in higher education, the state’s public universities say they are reviewing how they are required to implement the law. 
The Republican-controlled Kentucky General Assembly overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of House Bill 4 last month. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said during deliberation on her bill that it “would allow our universities and colleges to return to their focus away from social engineering to provide Kentucky students with excellent academic instruction in an environment that fosters critical thinking through open, constructive dialog.”
However, at least one Kentucky college student, Bradley Price, says the law will change the culture of her campus “and it’s going to be irreparable.” 
Price, a Black student who enrolled in the University of Louisville’s Pan-African Studies program because of the university’s reputation as a diverse institution, frequently went to Frankfort throughout the legislative session to protest against the bill. Price was among advocates who witnessed Beshear sign the veto for the legislation. 
“Obviously, it was the outcome that I knew was coming, but I was still utterly disappointed, for lack of a better term,” Price said of the overturned veto in a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern. 
Price, a junior, said she’s already seeing some changes at UofL, such as a sign promoting diversity in business being taken down, and has heard name changes may be coming to programs for Martin Luther King scholars to comply with HB 4. When asked about those changes, UofL spokesperson John Karman said he could not speculate “on potential impacts at this point.”
Though she is originally from Kentucky, Price feels like continuing her education in the state would be a challenge. She wants to pursue a PhD in English literature and ultimately teach in higher education herself. 
“I’m personally discouraged from continuing any more education in Kentucky,” Price said. “I don’t see any value in it. It’s exhausting having my identities constantly attacked every legislative session.”
Universities review the law
HB 4 directs the governing boards of Kentucky’s public universities to enact a policy by June 30 to meet requirements under the law such as not restricting scholarship eligibility criteria on the basis of religion, race, sex, color, or national origin and not requiring or encouraging students to complete courses “of which the primary purpose is to indoctrinate participants with a discriminatory concept.”
Next year on July 1, each institution must begin submitting annual certification to the Council on Postsecondary Education to verify the institution has not spent money to support DEI programs.
Newly installed UofL President Gerry Bradley told members of the Faculty Senate earlier this month that the university was reviewing the law with all general counsels of Kentucky public universities and the office of Attorney General Russell Coleman to “determine what exactly are the provisions of this bill and what are the carve outs and where is the crossing the line.”
He expanded on those comments in a press conference the next day and emphasized that UofL would remain a “community of care” for all students while meeting the requirements of the law. Bradley also said he plans to meet with students, faculty and staff as part of a listening tour throughout the rest of 2025. 
“And clearly our intent is we will comply with law, but we will clearly continue with our mission, which is to make every person feel like they belong here, that they are a part of our community, and that means different things for different people, and I think we have to be meeting people in those spaces, and we have to support them,” Bradley said. 
Last year, the University of Kentucky and Northern Kentucky University closed their DEI offices after a similar bill failed to pass during the 2024 legislative session. 
In response to the Lantern, UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said the university “will, of course, comply with the law” and added that “we believe UK already complies with the legislation” based on changes initiated last fall under President Eli Capilouto’s direction, such as closing UK’s DEI office. 
“We will be working with the other institutions and the Council on Postsecondary Education with respect to the required survey,” Blanton said. “Further, the legislation contains clear language protecting academic freedom and instruction, which we communicate with our campus community about regularly.” 
At NKU, President Cady Short-Thompson wrote in a March 28 campus-wide email that the university “will make the necessary changes to ensure we comply with the law” but will continue to support all students, faculty and staff. She announced that some programs on campus would have their names changed to reflect the law, such as renaming the “Center for Student Inclusiveness” to the “Center for Community and Connections.” 
“These are challenging decisions and times; yet our mission of student access and success has never been more essential,” Short-Thompson wrote. “It is my sincere hope that we can reimagine a way to build connections across our students and colleagues in new and still meaningful ways, learning from one another about our various differences and similarities. I believe in the strength, dedication, and impact of the people of Northern Kentucky University. We will navigate these challenges together.”

Other public universities and colleges in Kentucky echoed those sentiments. April Hobbs Nutter, a spokesperson for Morehead State University, said its general counsel is reviewing the law and MSU will “remain dedicated to our mission of providing a high-quality education and fostering an environment where our students can succeed.” 
Jace Lux, Western Kentucky University spokesperson, said the university “remains committed to maintaining a welcoming and supportive environment for all members of our campus community.” WKU’s general counsel and campus leadership are reviewing all passed legislation to determine how it will impact the university. Before part of HB 4 takes effect this summer, Lux said “we will share any necessary updates with the campus community.” 
Eastern Kentucky University is also reviewing the law and plans to comply with it, said spokesperson Sarah Baker in a statement. 
“Our employees work hard to provide support services that help all our students cross the finish line at graduation and obtain their degrees,” Baker said. “We will continue to work tirelessly every day to meet our students where they are, provide them with world-class academic programming and support their journey.”
Murray State University said in a statement that it is “continuing to thoughtfully navigate possible impacts enacted at the state and federal levels” like other higher education institutions within Kentucky and nationwide. 
“As we continue to assess and adjust as needed, Murray State remains committed to the success and support of all of our students throughout their collegiate experience,” the statement said. 
Kentucky State University, the state’s only public historically Black college or university, is reviewing the bill and its requirements, said spokesperson Jessica Holman. The university declined to give an official statement at this time. 
The Kentucky Community and Technical College System has been “reviewing programs, events, and resources to verify compliance with HB 4,” said spokesperson Blair Hess. KCTCS plans to comply with the law as well. 
“KCTCS has and will continue to provide support to all students to ensure they are successful in completing their credential and entering the workforce as prepared and skilled as possible,” Hess said. “We are committed to educating the workforce of Kentucky, and that does not have to change.”
When asked about her thoughts on universities planning to comply with the law while continuing to support students, Price said that’s likely not possible. 
“I just don’t think it’s feasible for the schools to be able to support all their students if legally they are not allowed to even have programs that support their marginalized students,” she said. “I don’t think it’s going to work.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3824-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

(University of Kentucky photo)In the wake of last week’s stock market turmoil, The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled, “Will the Last Investor to Leave America Please Turn Out the Lights?” The author, James Mackintosh, argues that the stock market’s wild gyrations — and, in particular, the instability in the valuation of Treasury notes and the U.S. dollar — indicate nothing less than a loss of faith in America. The previously unthinkable possibility of a default is looming on the horizon. The period of American economic exceptionalism is over.
What a sad and pathetic outcome after only three months of an administration that came to power on a promise to “Make America Great Again.” But the leader of that movement — I didn’t say its führer — does not understand soft power. The only language he appears to be able to speak is crude and violent. It involves threats, fear and the denigration of opponents both at home and abroad. Did I say “opponents”? Our president and his team take pleasure in insulting allies and friends. 
But this piece is not devoted to foreign policy or the economy, areas in which I cannot claim greater expertise than any reasonably well-informed citizen. I am writing about conditions at the University of Kentucky, where I teach and conduct my scholarly work. 
The chaotic and incompetent policies of our current national administration are producing the same effects in academe that James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal has diagnosed in the economic sphere: loss of faith in America. 
The Kentucky Lantern recently reported on the revocation of visas held by international graduate students at the University of Kentucky. We have not learned how many visas were revoked, apart from the fact that the number was said to be “small.” Neither have we learned anything about the grounds on which the visas were canceled. 
Were the affected graduate students guilty of illegal acts: theft, sexual assault, rioting? It would be easy to see why visas would be withdrawn in such circumstances. But perhaps they were just citizens of the “wrong” countries or made comments critical of Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza. Perhaps they even criticized our Great Leader!
I suspect that there is a system behind the uncertainty: the goal is to instill fear. In this goal, the administration has certainly succeeded. Many of our international graduate students are afraid that they could be arrested — in broad daylight, by masked immigration agents — and whisked away to some deportation center, where they would be on their own, isolated from colleagues and friends.
 Their transgression could be as trivial as having authored an opinion piece in a student newspaper. What a terrible, terrible betrayal of the young scholars, scientists, and artists who came to America looking forward to a great education.
 What a betrayal of the ideals of American higher education, renowned worldwide for its high standards, professionalism and academic freedom. Even the vast majority of international graduate students who will not be affected by the current purge will lose some — much, perhaps all — of their respect and admiration for our country. We are facing a loss of cultural influence, “soft power,” in the educational arena that is tragic and was altogether avoidable. 
I myself came to the United States in 1997 to take up my first tenure-track position. I never regretted my decision. In 2011, I became a proud citizen. More recently, I returned to America after a disappointing few years of teaching in Europe, whose universities I found infected, suffocated even by clichés of progressive group-thinking. 
So, yes, I am a conservative, a Republican — and totally shocked that our Republican members of Congress are letting all this happen.
 “All this” refers to the abandonment of the rule of law that is behind the current chaos and dysfunction. Just as international graduate students and undocumented immigrants are removed from the country without due process, so the tariffs that have led to last week’s market collapse have been imposed on the basis of highly questionable emergency powers. A group of Democratic senators — joined by Rand Paul, Republican from Kentucky, along with several other Republican senators — have introduced bipartisan legislation to curb the president’s falsely claimed authority to impose tariffs.
So there is yet hope — hope that there will be enough honorable Republicans who, along with their Democratic colleagues, are going to restore the rule of law in this country. If this happens soon, perhaps the damage inflicted by the Trump presidency can still be contained.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-e1744672067253.png,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

Veteran constitutional […]","Demonstrators in downtown Raleigh declare Allison Riggs rightfully won the state Supreme Court race against Jefferson Griffin.  (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)It’s hard to overstate the magnitude and importance of the injustice that four members of the North Carolina Supreme Court – Chief Justice Paul Newby and Associate Justices Curtis “Trey” Allen, Tamara Barringer, and Phil Berger, Jr. – are attempting to perpetrate against the people of North Carolina and the rule of law.
Veteran constitutional law scholar Prof. Gene Nichol rightfully put it this way in describing the foul foursome’s decision last Friday to overturn the expressed will of voters and, in effect, steal a Supreme Court election: “On Friday, April 11, 2025, a day in judicial infamy, the North Carolina Supreme Court crossed the Rubicon.” He called on all four to resign.
The object of Prof. Nichol’s thoroughly justified ire, of course, was the group’s outrageous ruling that a large number of ballots legally cast in the November 2024 state Supreme Court election between incumbent Justice Allison Riggs and challenger Jefferson Griffin can be retroactively thrown out because they – the justices – disagree with previous unanimous and bipartisan rulings on managing those ballots rendered long prior to the election by the State Board of Elections.
Think about that for a moment — it’s a stunning concept.
Thousands of voters who cast ballots according to longstanding and duly adopted rules — rules not even controversial enough to have received a single dissenting vote on an election board that’s frequently divided on partisan lines – can now be disenfranchised months after the election in such a way that it will quite possibly overturn the result.
The absurdity of the decision was even too much for conservative Republican Justice Richard Dietz. As he wrote in a passionate and on-the mark dissenting opinion:

        “By every measure, this is the most impactful election-related court decision our state has seen in decades. It cries out for our full review and for a decisive rejection of this sort of post hoc judicial tampering in election results.”    
 
Dietz went on to say that even if the federal courts ultimately set the matter right, his four colleagues have opened a dangerous Pandora’s Box:

        “Even if the federal courts ultimately reverse the Court of Appeals decision…the door is open for losing candidates to try this sort of post-election meddling in state court in the future. We should not allow that.”    
 
Dietz’s critique of changing election rules after the ballots are in goes to the heart of what’s so grievously wrong with the majority’s decision, but for those trying to better understand what’s really going on here, a look at the practicalities of overseas voting and the rules the election board adopted is also helpful.
The issue here is whether those voters should have been required to provide a copy of their photo ID with their ballots.
As NC Newsline’s Lynn Bonner reported in early February, there were big and utterly reasonable legal and practical reasons why the board opted not to impose such a requirement.
First and foremost was the likely conflict posed by a federal law called the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA. The election board was rightfully concerned that if it tried to require photo ID of military and overseas voters, it would run afoul of both that (and the common practice in other states).
And then there were the simple practicalities of how such a requirement might have even been implemented. In her report, Bonner spoke with overseas voter Aidan Hunt, who told her that he used the official electronic portal to vote and didn’t believe it even featured a way to send a copy of an ID.
“As best as I can recall, there’s no function to upload random stuff going through that portal. There wasn’t any place designated for an ID,” he said. “It’s not like an email message where you can just put whatever in there.”
All of these factors are more than sufficient to illustrate the folly of the Newby-Allen-Barringer-Berger ruling, but just to add another extra measure of mind-blowing absurdity, consider this: the ruling apparently only applies to some military and overseas ballots that the GOP candidate challenged.
As Justice Anita Earls wrote in her dissenting opinion:

        “What is worse, these targeted voters are only those who happened to have registered in Guilford County, or maybe one of three or four other counties that vote heavily Democratic, the special order is not clear, but in any case, not every such voter in the state.”    
 
You got that? North Carolina is preparing to throw out a bundle of ballots cast by lawful voters, but only in areas more likely to vote Democratic. Riggs, for example, won Guilford County by a margin of more than 25%.
As the saying goes, you really can’t make this stuff up.
Justice Riggs has, of course, appealed to the federal courts, and if there’s any justice left in this creaky old republic, the Newby-Allen-Barringer-Berger abomination will not stand. But even in the best-case scenario, the damage to the legitimacy of our judiciary and the democracy it’s supposed to safeguard will be immense and long-lasting.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250405_124319-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

Oral arguments will be heard Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Rhode Island’s seven-year legal battle against fossil fuel companies has amassed thousands of pages of documents across multiple courts.
But what lawyers will argue in a Tuesday morning hearing in Newport County Superior Court focuses on a single phrase: “and/or.”
Lawyers for Chevron Corp., one of the 21 oil and gas companies named in the 2018 state complaint, want the case tossed on the grounds that the state failed to investigate a key claim in its climate change lawsuit. The challenge filed by then-Attorney General Peter Kilmartin seeks damages from fossil fuel companies on the assertion that for each company, “a substantial portion of fossil fuel products are or have been extracted, refined, transported, traded, distributed, marketed, promoted, manufactured, sold, and/or consumed in Rhode Island.” 
“The State does not present a scintilla of evidence concerning what it knew or whether it conducted any investigation into these facts in 2018 when it filed its Complaint,” Gerald Petros, partner with Providence firm Hinckley Allen & Snyder LLP who is representing Chevron Corp. wrote in a Feb. 7 filing in Newport County Superior Court. Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP is also representing the company in court proceedings.
And, according to Petros, there is no evidence of any oil production or refinement in Rhode Island, as confirmed by the state’s own Office of Energy Resources website as well as the U.S. Department of Energy.
The state offers a different interpretation.
“The phrase “and/or” makes paragraph 21(g)’s meaning plain: The State alleges that a substantial portion of Chevron’s fossil-fuel products are involved in some combination of the in-state activities listed in the sentence — not necessarily all of those activities,” Matthew Edling, a partner with San Francisco-based Sher Edling LLP that joined with the AG’s office on the complaint, wrote in a March 21 response. “The State did not allege that each of the listed activities individually and independently accounted for a substantial portion of Chevron’s fossil fuel business in Rhode Island. That is why the State used the phrase ‘and/or,’ rather than the word ‘and’ by itself.”
The dispute over word choice marks the latest twist in a long and winding saga of the landmark climate action lawsuit. Rhode Island was the first state in the country to sue fossil fuel companies, setting off a wave of similar attempts by other states, cities and counties to use the courts to force oil and gas companies to take responsibility for their part in climate change. The initial 2019 ruling by Providence Superior Court Judge William E. Smith triggered a series of jurisdictional appeals by the fossil fuel companies that weren’t resolved until April 2023, when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the companies’ petition to have the case heard in federal court.
After the case returned to state court, Chevron took issue with the wording of the state’s initial complaint. Both sides verbally agreed in June 204 that they needed more information around the nature of fossil fuel companies’ activities and business in Rhode Island, according to Edling’s response in court. Chevron led negotiations for all the named fossil fuel companies, proposing a voluntary agreement around information sharing on Oct. 3, 2024, Edling wrote. 
The state accepted the offer and returned a signed copy to Chevron the next month, only for Chevron to request new conditions to the agreement. The state pushed back and Chevron pulled out of the agreement. 
By Dec. 13, 2024, Chevron sent the state a letter challenging the paragraph about local impacts of oil production and refinement and demanding the state produce evidence to show Chevron’s local activities. A formal motion to toss the entire lawsuit was filed in Newport County Superior Court in February.
‘Shotgun allegations’
The language spat around “and/or” lays the framework for a more significant allegation regarding the state’s own court rules. Under Chapter 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, any papers or documents submitted by attorneys in any case must have a factual basis — meaning existing evidence or the likelihood of evidence once an investigation is conducted. Chevron’s lawyers allege that the state never attempted to investigate or prove its claims regarding the existence of oil production or refinement in Rhode Island at all, rendering its claims “baseless,” “frivolous,” and in violation of court procedural rules. 
That the lawsuit relies on the exact same wording for all companies named further suggests lack of research, according to the Feb. 7 filing.
“These shotgun allegations beg credulity: did fourteen separate companies all engage in identical activities in Rhode Island?” the motion states.
The state, in turn, points to the six-year span between when its lawsuit was filed, and when the oil and gas company raised questions about procedural violations.
“Chevron has wasted months of the State’s time and resources, and now it wastes the Court’s,” Edling wrote in the March 21 response on behalf of the state.










“These shotgun allegations beg credulity: did fourteen separate companies all engage in identical activities in Rhode Island?”


– From the Feb. 7 motion filed by attorneys for Chevron Corp. in the state climate change lawsuit 


The state also listed examples of Chevron’s historic and ongoing activities in Rhode Island as proof of the factual basis for its case. From the early 20th century until the 1980s, Chevron owned and operated a fuel terminal off Veterans Memorial Parkway in East Providence. Chevron has filed annual reports for its business in Rhode Island with the Rhode Island Department of State through 2024, while selling gas from its Philadelphia refinery into Cumberland Farms gas stations, among others, according to evidence submitted by the state.
Three days later, on March 24, the state filed another motion seeking to force Chevron and the other companies named as plaintiffs to hand over evidence detailing sales at local gas stations, natural gas business activities and advertising in Rhode Island. 
The hearing Tuesday morning before Rhode Island Associate Justice William E. Carnes includes oral arguments over Chevron’s push to toss the case, and the state’s motion to compel companies to provide more evidence on business activity and sales in Rhode Island. An additional hearing is scheduled before Carnes on May 8, according to the public docket.
Judges in four other states, including New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and New York have tossed similar state, county or city-level challenges against fossil fuel companies. But dozens more remain under consideration in state-level courts across the country, including in Massachusetts. 
And in March, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the bid led by Republican state attorneys general that would have blocked these lawsuits from proceeding.
Theodore Boutrous, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher LLP representing Chevron, pointed to the dismissals of similar lawsuits in other state courts when asked for comment.
“These claims are based on interstate and international emissions and, therefore, are precluded and preempted by federal law under clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent,” Boutros said in an emailed statement Monday. “As the New Jersey Superior Court held in dismissing New Jersey’s similar state lawsuit, ‘the leading and most persuasive case supporting dismissal is the Second Circuit decision in City of New York. There, the federal appeals court rejected the availability of state tort law in the climate change context.’”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha maintained the state was on “the right side of the law.”
“It’s rich, pun intended, that Big Oil would suggest that our case isn’t well-grounded in fact, considering that the harsh realities of climate change are presenting themselves all around us while these companies turn a blind eye in order to protect their profits,” Neronha said in a statement Monday. “Look, semantics aside, oil and gas companies must be held responsible for lying and causing great damage to the people of Rhode Island, Americans generally, and the environment. We believe we are on the right side of the law here, and we will make that clear tomorrow in court.”
Legislative parallel 
Meanwhile, lawmakers in 10 states, including Rhode Island, are considering legislation that would force fossil fuel companies to pay recovery costs for climate-related disasters.
Rhode Island’s proposed “Climate Superfund” bill would allow the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management to bill companies that “engaged in the trade or business of extracting or refining fossil fuels,” based on what the state or municipalities spent on climate mitigation since 2009. Any company responsible for emitting or producing at least 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2024 would be subject to review and potential repayment to state and local entities, according to the bills cosponsored by Democratic Rep. Jennifer Boylan of Barrington, and Sen. Linda Ujifusa of Portsmouth.
Similar policies were adopted by lawmakers in Vermont and New York last year.
Boylan described the proposal as a parallel way to recoup damages from big polluters, rather than an alternative to the state’s ongoing climate action lawsuit.
“Both are important,” Boylan said in an interview on Monday.










It’s rich, pun intended, that Big Oil would suggest that our case isn’t well-grounded in fact, considering that the harsh realities of climate change are presenting themselves all around us while these companies turn a blind eye in order to protect their profits.

Rhode Island is staring down a projected $250 million budget deficit for its upcoming fiscal year, alongside potentially disastrous cuts to federal funding. That makes additional revenue sources especially important to pay for projects that protect against sea level rise, flooding and other climate change-induced disasters, Boylan said.
“Every day that we wait, the amount we’re spending on climate mitigation is getting bigger and bigger,” Boylan said. “It’s not just about having oil rigs or being near the coast. It’s really catastrophic, unprecedented weather, and you combine that with sea level rise, it’s a real problem.”
Boylan’s and Ujifusa’s bills remain under consideration by committees in their chambers, following initial hearings in February and March, respectively.

According to the State Council of Higher Education of Virginia, 32% of undergraduate students in the commonwealth borrowed money during the 2023-2024 school year, which is a decrease from 43% in the 2012-2013 school year.
During the 2023-24 school year, Virginia was awarded $1.4 billion in federal funds, with an average of $11,000 going to each of 131,045 students.
On April 3, the U.S. Department of Education announced it is seeking public feedback on changes to its student aid regulations that “streamline or eliminate unnecessary regulatory processes that are not required by law.”
The agency added that the process should focus on how Title IV regulations have impacted “institutions, states and other partners,” and if implementing certain student aid programs “may be inhibiting innovation and contributing to rising college costs.”
Acting Under Secretary James Bergeron said in an April 3 statement: “Not only will this rule making serve as an opportunity to identify and cut unnecessary red tape, but it will allow key stakeholders to offer suggestions to streamline and improve federal student aid programs.”
According to Federal Student Aid, an office in the Department of Education, the office provides more than $111 billion in federal student aid each year through grants, loans and work-study, which allows students at participating schools to earn money to pay for tuition, books and housing.
Virginians commonly apply for assistance by completing the FAFSA, which has recently been overhauled and faced criticism for its delays, or the VASA application to their preferred institution. 
State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, told the Mercury she anticipates hearing from her constituents soon about the proposed changes as students and families begin applying for federal financial aid for the fall semester. 
“So many of our students depend absolutely on Pell Grants (and) on the federal loans in order to have access to higher education,” Hashmi said, “and so with the wholesale firing of so many employees in the Department of Education, the ability of that department to be efficient and effective in processing these applications is on the line.” 
Hashmi said she’s also concerned that staff cuts at the U.S. Department of Education could negatively impact the agency’s ability to handle issues “as they come up” for those seeking assistance. Some of the applicants seeking assistance are first-generation and low-income students.
One of the most controversial programs being considered for a change is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives the student loan balances of borrowers who make 10 years of payments and hold public service jobs, such as working for the government or a nonprofit.
On March 7, President Donald Trump directed the agency to review the program through an executive order claiming former President Joe Biden’s administration “abused” the program by using taxpayer funds to pay off employee loans before they were up. The order said the previous administration also “misdirected” tax dollars into “activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”
However, critics have argued the administration has instead targeted nonprofit organizations that focus on assisting immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community.

“Threatening to punish hardworking Americans for their employers’ perceived political views is about as flagrant a violation of the First Amendment as you can imagine,” said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense, in a March statement. “If the Trump administration follows through on this threat, they can plan to see us in court.”  
Trump also wrote in the order that individuals employed by organizations whose activities have a “substantial illegal purpose” shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness.
The education department will also be taking feedback to improve the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, which allows students to pay back what is owed on a fixed monthly plan over 12 years, adjusted based on their income or 20% of the extra money.
With the threats to overhaul education, including cuts to research institutions, Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said the idea of changing financial aid regulations is concerning for students. 
Financial aid offices at various colleges and universities are charged with processing applications and creating aid packages. But, with the FAFSA issues, administrators have already been frustrated with the delays.
Rasoul said this is going to create a “bureaucratic mess for our students and universities as we move forward.”
Hashmi added, “This is really, really concerning, and it is going to create a tidal wave of concerns for not just the students, but for our colleges and universities and especially in those institutions that have large populations of students who come with federal financial aid.”
The agency will hold an in-person meeting on April 29 and a virtual hearing on May 1. Public comments must be submitted through the Federal eRulemaking Portal.
As of April 14, 285 comments have been submitted to the Federal Register. The deadline for comments is May 5.

(Photo by David Paul Morris/Getty Images)Kids’ menus may serve up smaller portions, but smaller doesn’t always mean healthier.
A piece of legislation recently heard in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly would set nutritional standards for restaurants that serve kids’ meals by capping calories, sodium, added sugars, and fats. The default drink included with a children’s meal would be water, milk or a milk substitute.
Sen. Pam Lauria, the bill’s sponsor and a Barrington Democrat, told her colleagues at an April 10 hearing of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services that the Healthy Kids Act isn’t meant to limit what businesses can do, but instead aims to improve families’ access to more nutritious meals for their kids. 
“Parents are very busy,” Lauria said. “There are sports, there are activities, and frequently they need to feed their children on the fly, and they will frequent a restaurant to help them to do that.”
The bill would give parents more “healthy options,” Lauria said, by specifying each restaurant with a kids’ menu serve at least two qualifying meals. A healthy kid’s meal per the bill’s definition has no more than 550 calories, 700 milligrams of sodium, and 15 grams of added sugars. A maximum 10% of calories would come from saturated fat, and no trans fats would be allowed. Portions would need to include at least two of five food groups, with one of them being a fruit or non-fried vegetable. 
The remaining kids’ meals would not need to follow these standards, and the default beverage choices could also be swapped out at the customer’s request. 
“What this bill does not do is stop restaurants from serving anything else that they want for children,” Lauria said to the Senate committee. “Kids can still have a hot dog if it’s on the menu, kids can still have chicken nuggets if they’re on the menu. Kids can still have a soda if they prefer, if their parents allow. This [bill] just says that we have to acknowledge that we need healthy options available, and that the healthy options should probably be default, particularly when it comes to sugary drinks.”
On the House side, the Healthy Kids Act is sponsored by Rep. Susan Donovan, a Bristol Democrat, and has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing. 
Lauria said that the bill was spurred by the “heartbreaking” prevalence of obesity among Rhode Island kids. According to the 2024 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook, Rhode Island ranks last place in New England for the number of children ages 10 to 17 that are overweight or obese, accounting for 35% of that demographic. Rhode Island ranks 39th on this same metric nationally, according to the factbook. There are also racial disparities in these numbers, the factbook noted: In 2022, 17% of Hispanic children ages 2 to 17 were overweight and 32% were obese, and 16% of non-Hispanic Black children were overweight and 28% were obese.

Doctors showed up to support the bill last week in the Senate, including Dr. Amy Nunn, CEO of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute and a professor at Brown University. 
The proposal is “just a common sense bill that promotes healthy opportunities for kids,” Nunn said. “Our obesity rates are nearly on par with states in the Deep South…Our children, our Hispanic children in Rhode Island, fare 49th in terms of lifetime health and education achievements. Those statistics are breathtaking.”
Nunn said the bill was about making accessible the kinds of meals “you would want to put in front of your children. Nobody wants their kids to be eating supersized food.” 
Dr. Philip Chan, also of the Public Health Institute and a primary care physician with Brown University Health, framed the bill as a preemptive measure to reduce chronic disease rates and health problems seen in Rhode Island’s adult population.  
“These behaviors start in childhood, right? So we have to start there in terms of addressing them,” Chan told senators. “You can have the chicken nuggets, you can have the lemonade or soda every once in a while, but have a vegetable, have a fruit. This is the thing that we try to teach our children. A lot of times you can’t find veggies or fruit on the menu. You have to order it specially made.”
Hamburger Happy Meal qualifies
The push to legislate healthier kids’ menus is not new. An April 2024 roundup by the Center for Science in the Public Interest found over 30 jurisdictions have laws governing children’s meals. The majority of these laws regulate the default beverage to push kids away from soda or other sugary drinks. Nutrition-based laws — ones closer to Rhode Island’s current proposal — are largely found in county-level governments, many of them in Maryland. Statewide initiatives in California, Hawaii, Delaware and Illinois have focused on beverages. 
Before the Senate committee, Nunn referenced these efforts, saying, “The data and studies around these bills show that they have had demonstrable impacts on improving healthy eating behaviors among kids and among people of color. So the science around all of this is really sound, and it really hasn’t had a huge detrimental impact on restaurants.”










You can have the chicken nuggets, you can have the lemonade or soda every once in a while, but have a vegetable, have a fruit.

Industry giants like McDonald’s have had enough time to change and accommodate the trend. The fast food juggernaut at first took a subversive approach to regulations, like in 2011 when McDonald’s locations in San Francisco started selling Happy Meal toys for 10 cents to get around a municipal law banning toys’ inclusion with unhealthy meals. But by 2014, McDonald’s had started to retool its menu, and in 2018 announced all of its kids’ meals would max out at 600-calories by 2022.
Today, a hamburger Happy Meal would satisfy the requirements of Rhode Island’s Healthy Kids Act. The cheeseburger Happy Meal, however, would not, as it exceeds pretty much every threshold specified in the bill (as well as McDonald’s previously stated goal, as it has 690 calories).
As for the enforceability of the proposed law, the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) would be charged with ensuring compliance. The bill text prescribes the health department to issue relevant rules and regulations, supply multilingual signage and outreach materials for restaurants, and check that restaurants are training staff properly and maintaining documentation about their meals’ compliance.  
But Dr. Jerome “Jerry” Larkin, the health department’s director, wrote in a testimony that those duties are easier said than done.   
The department “applauds the intent of the proposed legislation, which is to establish and enforce environmental food changes to address rising childhood obesity and associated chronic disease emergence in Rhode Island,” Larkin wrote. “However, RIDOH would not be able to implement the provisions outlined in the bill without adequate resources.” 
The department would need another full-time position to enforce the bill, Larkin wrote — specifically, a “grade 27” full-time, nutritionist position that would cost $116,544 a year, with that salary expected to increase in future years. 
Rolling out content like signage, plus tracking and analyzing compliance, would cost about $1,850 in the first year, Larkin wrote. The proposed cost for an extra nutritionist comes at a time when the department is still reconciling the recent loss of $31 million in federal grant money, as well as the potential loss of dozens of existing full-time staff.   
The Senate committee voted to hold Lauria’s bill for further study, the typical procedure for a bill at its first hearing.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fabian Schmidt, a German-American man living in Nashua, was returning home from a visit to Luxembourg on March 7 when he was detained by immigration officials at Boston Logan International Airport in early March and taken to a detention center in Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
Schmidt’s family said that, upon his detainment, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, and violently interrogated, according to a press release from attorney David Keller. He was also reportedly being denied his medications for anxiety and depression, and being given little food and water as officials pressured him to relinquish his green card.
His mother, Astrid Senior, told NBC News that she doesn’t know why her son was being held.
“I feel helpless, absolutely helpless,” she told the news broadcaster.
Schmidt has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager and has legal permanent resident status, according to the family. Court records in California, where he previously lived, show that he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. However, his family said those issues had been resolved in the courts and are no longer ongoing.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — have not provided a justification for Schmidt’s detainment. They have, however, denied the allegations that he was violently interrogated.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
Schmidt has a court date scheduled in June in Boston.
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said her office, in collaboration with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s office, has inquired within DHS and spoken with Schmidt’s family. She declined to speak on the issue during an event Monday, and said she is “honoring the wishes of the family and their legal advisers.”
“We are in touch with Homeland Security and Mr. Schmidt’s family, but we are also respecting their privacy,” Hassan said. “There’s ongoing litigation about it, so we will respect the privacy but we continue to be in touch with them.”
She would not say whether she knows the justification for his detainment.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Part of a broader Trump administration strategy
Schmidt is not the only legal U.S. immigrant to be part of a high profile legal battle over their immigration status. President Donald Trump, who made cracking down on immigration and mass deportation central tenets of his campaign in 2024, and his administration have launched a public campaign of deportations and detainments that have been decried as illegal and unethical after being reported by the press.
In one of the highest profile immigration-related incidents, Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and an Algerian citizen with permanent legal resident status in the U.S., was arrested by ICE officials in his New York City apartment on March 8, one day after Schmidt was detained. Khalil, who was born to Palestinian parents in a refugee enclave in Syria before ultimately immigrating to the U.S. and marrying a citizen, was an organizer of protests on Columbia University’s campus against the Israeli occupation and military action in Gaza. The State Department is currently attempting to revoke his legal status in the country and deport him as punishment for his role in the protests, a move that has generated an uproar among progressives and immigration advocates who believe Khalil has a protected right to free speech. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil engaged in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which foster a hostile environment for Jewish students in the U.S.” On Friday, a judge in Louisiana ruled that the State Department can deport Khalil. A federal court in New Jersey is expected to hear further appeals in the case. 
Several other university students who protested Israel’s war in Gaza have also been targeted by the Trump administration. 
Tufts University Ph.D. student Rümeysa Öztürk, from Turkey with a student visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 in Somerville, Mass. Video of her arrest, which shows six agents in plain clothes, some of whom were obscuring their badges or wearing hoods or face coverings, went viral online and sparked furor. While federal officials have not publicly provided justification for her arrest, Öztürk was the author of a 2024 op-ed in the university’s student newspaper calling for the university to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Hamas was not mentioned in the op-ed. 
Another Columbia University student, Yunseo Chung, an undergraduate student who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7 and is a permanent legal resident, was another target of ICE after the administration attempted to deport her over her involvement in the pro-Palesintian protests. However, the administration has been so far unsuccessful in deporting the woman, who was born in South Korea, amid a legal battle. Rubio, in a press conference last month, said the Trump administration has revoked over 300 visas of students who have engaged in pro-Palestine protest activity.
The Trump administration has also moved to purge Venezuelan and other Latin American migrants from the country under the auspices that they have connections to the violent Tren de Aragua  and MS-13 gangs. In March, the Trump administration flew 238 men to El Salvador with no due process. There, they are being detained in a notorious mega prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known for brutal conditions and under the control of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has described himself as “world’s coolest dictator.” The administration reportedly used some of the men’s tattoos and clothing as the sole evidence of their gang affiliations. However, an analysis of those deportees by CBS News found no criminal records for 179, or roughly 75%, of them.
That includes Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran citizen who’s lived in Maryland for 15 years. Even after admitting in court it deported him due to “administrative error,” the Trump administration refuses to bring Ábrego García back to the U.S., saying it is up to Salvadoran officials to decide his fate. This is despite the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return to the country. In an appearance at the White House Monday, Bukele said he would not return Ábrego García, calling the idea “preposterous” and asking, “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?”
Those deported also include a makeup artist who immigrated from Venezuela to California in August named Andry Hernandez Romero. He had no criminal record, no known gang affiliation, and was undergoing the asylum process after fleeing his country over fears he would be persecuted for being gay and his political beliefs, according to his lawyers. Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in these Salvadoran deportations. The move has been criticized for refusing to give the men due process and for its brutality. Rubio said Sunday that another 10 people have been sent to El Salvador. 
On Friday, Trump authorized the military to take control of land along the southern border. His announced plan is to station military troops there to detain immigrants traveling into the country from Mexico. He has also previously declared a national emergency arguing “America’s sovereignty is under attack” and that the border is “overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/schmidtrally-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A provision in the version of the two-year state budget passed by Ohio House Republicans would eliminate elected members from the State Board of Education. This comes after the last budget stripped the board of most of its power.
Final Ohio education budget expands vouchers, limits board of ed powers

The budget passed by the House last week would reduce the board membership from 11 elected members and eight governor-appointed members to five, all appointed by the governor.
When the terms of the current elected board members expire or the positions become vacant in another way, the seats would be eliminated. Three of the governor-appointed spots would also.
The House budget also changes the requirements for appointed board members to require “at least one member to represent each of a rural, suburban, and urban school district, a community school and a chartered nonpublic school.”
According to budget documents, the reduction would save Ohio about $50,000. Board members received an average of $3,500 in compensation in 2024, according to state data.
The budget is now in the hands of the Senate.
The House changes come along with a proposal that public education advocates say would cut public school funding and eliminate the Fair School Funding model that has been in place for the last four years. The existing model calls for $666 million, but the House budget would cut that by roughly two-thirds, to $226 million.
The board’s budget could be coming from a separate fund, rather than its own licensure fund on which it’s been relying since the last budget cycle limited their power within the state education system.
With the establishment of the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce two years ago, the board’s powers were largely stripped away and what powers remained were centered on teacher licensure and territorial disputes. It was strongly opposed by board members and members of  the public.
The last two years have been a financial struggle after the change to the teacher licensure fund as well. Superintendent of Public Instruction Paul Craft came to legislators with funding requests, telling lawmakers and the board that the uncertainty of the teacher licensure fund could harm the board’s bottom line, when staffing and expense cuts had been exhausted.

The fund’s revenue surges at certain points of the year, when teachers get or renew their licenses. The rest of the year, the board has to live on the funds provided by the state.
With the start of a new budget cycle, Craft asked for additional state support to help with the costs of annual background checks for school staff. He also asked to eliminate the video assessment portion of the Ohio Teacher Residency Program to save more than $1 million.
The House’s budget eliminates the teacher licensure fund, with the board’s operating expenses paid from the Occupational Licensing and Regulatory Fund. The fund already exists to pay into assistance funds for nursing education, certified public accountant education and veterinary student debt.
A Legislative Service Commission analysis of the budget changes noted that the moving to the occupational licensing fund “may provide greater financial stability” for the board, because that fund “serves as a shared operating fund for many occupational licensing and regulatory boards and commissions.” They are supported by license fees, fines, penalties and “other assessments” put in the fund by those boards and commissions.
The House also added $2 million from the General Revenue Fund in each fiscal year for the educator background check service, called the Retained Applicant Fingerprint Database (or Rapback).
While a spokesperson for the board of education said it was “premature” to comment on the reduction in board members at this point, he said the House changes to the funding, along with the elimination of the video teacher assessment, could mean good things for the board.
“We were actually very happy with the financial side of things,” said board spokesman Alex Goodman.
Appropriations based on the House draft would give the board $16.3 million in fiscal year 2026, and $16.8 million in fiscal year 2027.
A spokesperson for the House majority caucus did not comment on the elimination of elected officials in the budget, but said the funding changes “reflect the recent restructuring of the board’s responsibility for licensing and conduct of educators.”
“Aligning with the funding of nearly all other licensing boards, this shift addresses the long-standing status of the state board as somewhat of an outlier,” said Olivia Wile, caucus press secretary. “It promotes consistency across the system and is expected to be advantageous over time, potentially reducing the pressure for increased licensing fees in the future.”
Goodman said board leaders are already preparing to testify to the Senate the budget process moves to that chamber over the next month.

Ricky Hill, R-Cabot. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A legislative budget committee on Monday pulled down a bill that would have added $250 million to a fund dedicated to prison construction in Arkansas. 
The decision comes less than a week after state lawmakers said a separate $750 million appropriation bill to support construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County appears dead after five failed votes in the Senate. Disputes over the two bills are the latest in a monthslong battle to fund and build a new state penitentiary in the rural western Arkansas county. 
Senate Bill 633 would authorize the addition of $250 million from general revenue to a correctional facilities fund that the Legislature placed $330 million into in 2023. State lawmakers also set aside $75 million in 2022 for expanding the state’s prison capacity, and that money has already been allocated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. 
Republican lawmakers questioned the intent of SB 633 during the Joint Budget Committee’s meeting Monday. Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, asked if the bill was “a backdoor way” to fund the new penitentiary. 
Meanwhile, Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, sought assurances that state officials wouldn’t try to pull money from a separate $350 million miscellaneous appropriation to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration to support prison construction.
“I have no problem moving money into this account, but I think that we need to have a path of where we think we’re going…but what I want to make sure is that it’s not our intention that we’re going to use a large part of that miscellaneous appropriation that we give through DF&A to fund this prison,” Hickey said. 
Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote

Specifically, Hickey asked if the $75 million that’s already been allocated to the corrections department would be used to assess a more detailed cost estimate of the whole project as requested by some state lawmakers. 
Magnolia Republican and Joint Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Lane Jean said the goal is to spend the $75 million first. 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has called for expanding bed capacity at state prisons to alleviate overcrowding in county jails. A lack of space at Arkansas prisons has led to some state inmates being housed in local jails. 
Controversy arose last October when Sanders announced the state purchased 815 acres near Charleston for nearly $3 million as a site to construct a new prison. Local residents and state officials decried the lack of transparency in the decision and have pushed back against the project for months. 
The Arkansas Board of Corrections has moved forward with the project by hiring a construction management company and seeking proposals from architectural firms and contractors. 
Searcy Republican and JBC Vice Chair Sen. Jonathan Dismang recommended removing SB 633 from consideration Monday, noting that the corrections department isn’t likely to use all $75 million before next year’s fiscal session in April when lawmakers could again explore options for funding prison expansion.  
If officials do need additional funding before then, they have the ability to request lawmakers’ approval for a temporary appropriation increase, Dismang said.
“There’s no reason to have a continued debate this morning with where we are in the session,” he said. 
The Arkansas Legislature is scheduled to finish the bulk of its work by Wednesday, before recessing for a few weeks and officially adjourning the legislative session on May 5.

Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.











Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug



“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
A debate headed for the ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting marijuana potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
Drug decriminalization stumbled in Oregon. Other states are taking note.

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
The Colorado psychedelic mushroom experiment has arrived

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New England Head Start office closed; federal funding in flux,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/ct-head-start-office-closes/,"Although funding for the early childhood program has not been cut, uncertainty remains about its future. One parent said she is ‘terrified.’","The email popped up in David Morgan’s inbox a couple of weeks ago: an employee at the Head Start Program office in Boston, which covers the New England region, was letting him know it was their last day of work and they would no longer be his point of contact. 
The employee hoped Morgan, who heads up TEAM, Inc, a nonprofit that runs 56 Head Start classrooms, might soon have a new contact with another office, but no further details were provided.
The Boston office was one of five regional offices around the country to be shuttered earlier this month. And although funding for the child care and preschool program has not been cut, uncertainty remains about its future.
“The federal government is not coming to help Connecticut, and we’re beginning to see the signs of how challenging that’s going to be,” Morgan said. 
If the program was to be consolidated, Morgan said, he would understand that, but “this is the most chaotic, foggy way to do it.”
Head Start was created by former President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration to fight poverty by helping low-income children access early childhood education. Since its founding in 1965, the program has served around 40 million children. 
Advocates say that losing Head Start would have a detrimental impact not only on children, who benefit from education, along with meals, vision and dental screenings, but also force scores of parents to leave the workforce. It could also inflict a blow to Gov. Ned Lamont’s goal of creating universal pre-K.
There are 5,718 children currently enrolled in Head Start and Early Head Start in Connecticut, according to the Office of Early Childhood. A child is eligible for the program when their family is at or falls below federal poverty guidelines, if they are a foster child, if they are experiencing homelessness or if they are enrolled in a support service like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Depending on their income, parents pay for the program on a sliding fee scale.
While funding for the program has not yet been cut, Morgan is anxious about whether he will receive word about the program’s next grant by the deadline of May 1 without his usual points of contact. 
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye said that the Head Start regional office also oversaw Care4Kids and Child Care Development Fund grants, and that her office communicated with them once or twice a week. 
“They are some of the smartest people I know, and they stay highly informed on early childhood issues and help us know what other states are doing that works,” Bye said. “I am in utter shock at how undervalued these very skilled professionals are.”  
Now, parents whose children attend the programs are worried about what comes next. 
Meghan Johnson’s 3-year-old daughter attends a Head Start program in Ansonia. 
“She’s growing and blossoming every day,” Johnson said. “Every day she says something new to me and then she’s telling me her teachers taught her that or her friends taught her that.” 
Johnson said before she found the program she was spending half of her paycheck on child care. When she heard that the regional Head Start program’s office had closed, she was “terrified.”
“It’s very scary to wake up every morning and not know (if I’ll have child care), your life is kind of in limbo,” she said. 
Bye pointed out that all of the Head Start offices that were shuttered were located in “blue” states — New York, Washington, Massachusetts, California and Illinois. “It just doesn’t make sense, it makes you think it was not based on any thought process — it was political.”
Recently, Bye saw a USA Today headline indicating that the Trump administration’s proposed budget would eliminate Head Start altogether. But Bye believes the Head Start program will endure because it enjoys bipartisan support.
“It’s hard to fathom how a thinking person would cut Head Start when it’s such a good return on investment,” Bye said. “But even if they tried, I don’t think they can: politically these cuts affect red states more than blue states. Blue states have more of their own infrastructure.”
This year, Bye has been hard at work representing Lamont and his plan to establish universal pre-K in Connecticut. The end of Head Start would be a major setback to that effort. Bye may think that cutting the program is illogical but admits, “we can’t rule that out.”
Morgan said he, too, has hope the program will survive recent rounds of federal cuts. Recently, he got a new point of contact in the Washington, D.C., office. He’s trying not to alarm employees and families. But the uncertainty is taking a toll.
“I cry to my wife every night. There’s nothing fun about any of this,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0414_SR_HeadStart_005-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:00:35.913684

While the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship Program exists to help families afford quality care, administrative red tape has caused this vital resource to be underutilized. 
Recent reports from both the UNH Carsey School of Public Policy and the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute confirm what many families already know: our Child Care Scholarship system is hampered by “substantial paperwork and complicated application processes” that limit its reach and effectiveness. 
In a series of focus groups, participants applying for the Child Care Scholarship said they found the process “particularly complicated,” and reported experiencing “substantial stress” and investing “significant time” in applying. As one parent described the process, “You literally have to have all your ducks in a row for you to even apply.” This parent explained, “You have to have the day care that they’re going to, the hours that they’re going to be, and then you have to have that all set up with your work.” 
Even with all those pieces in place, the parent described a frustrating “runaround” in the application process. “There’s been a few times when I’m, like, OK, what do you need? Do you need blood at this point? Because it’s just like I’ve given you everything at this point.” 
And while going through this process, the parent explained, “You see those [child care] balances adding up and if you miss one thing and they deny [your application], then you have to redo it all over again hoping that [the child care provider won’t say] you need to pay this until they can reimburse us.”
Our state lawmakers have the power to remove unnecessary barriers Child Care Scholarship participants have experienced. 
Senate Bill 243, for example, would create a pilot program for “presumptive eligibility,” allowing families who meet basic screening criteria to receive up to 60 days of scholarship funding while their full application is processed. This addresses a critical gap during which families could have to delay the start of a job while waiting for scholarship approval. Parents should not have to turn down employment opportunities because they can’t afford child care while their paperwork is being processed. 
The bill would also require a study of the application process itself. In recent listening sessions across the state, New Futures learned that families applying for Child Care Scholarship funding face time-consuming requests for information and documentation, often beyond what’s needed to determine eligibility for the scholarship program. Blended or foster families, parents with disabilities that exempt them from the program’s work requirements, families with limited technology, and families with a primary language other than English can face additional hurdles in the application process. This study will ensure eligible families aren’t unreasonably discouraged from participating in the program. 
And, the bill aligns scholarship processes with the realities of modern child care businesses. Currently, providers waste valuable time reporting detailed attendance data despite the fact that payments are now based on enrollment, not attendance. The legislation would streamline these processes and also create a system of up-front payments for child care providers — just as they receive from non-scholarship families — offering greater economic stability and encouraging more providers to accept scholarship families. 
Such updates to the Child Care Scholarship program would address problems that are preventing an existing program from reaching its full potential. The benefits of these improvements would extend far beyond administrative convenience. When more families can access the scholarship program, more children receive quality care linked to positive developmental outcomes, child care businesses receive much-needed support, and parents can participate more fully in our state’s workforce. And importantly, the federal government more than matches every state dollar spent on the program. 
At a time when child care costs are crushing family budgets and limiting our workforce, we can’t afford to let administrative barriers restrict access to this important program. 
Cora Hoppe, the executive director of the Rochester Child Care Center, has noted that when families secure a scholarship: “The sense of relief is huge. I don’t see parents coming in panicked about paying their bill or afraid to see me. [Parents] can build better relationships with the teachers and administration because they’re not worried about [paying their bill].” 
The New Hampshire Legislature has an opportunity to make our Child Care Scholarship program work as intended — supporting children, families, providers, and our economy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/childcareredtape-1024x682.png,,,2025-04-15 05:00:35.913684

(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Communications Workers of America (CWA))In an Ohio visit Monday, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-CA, critiqued and offered a counterpoint the Trump administration.
At the City Club of Cleveland, he argued the president’s campaign tapped into genuine grievances in cities that saw jobs move overseas, “but they offer no hopeful vision, no real solutions for the future.”
Khanna jabbed Trump about “conquering” Greenland and building a fortress out of tariffs, but added, “you simply can’t have James Polk’s expansionism, and William McKinley’s protectionism, and expect to win in the 21st century.”
Polk’s administration annexed territory from Texas to Washington in the 1840s, at the cost of a war with Mexico, and heightened tensions between slave and free states. McKinley’s calling card in in Congress and as president was protectionism, although even he was having second thoughts when he was assassinated.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Khanna described the Trump administration’s tariff strategy as a disastrous self-inflicted wound. Instead of lashing out at other nations, U.S. leaders should be investing in companies that could be the economic engine of their communities.
Khanna termed this “economic patriotism” with lofty comparisons to the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe following World War II. But the more recent example was the CHIPS Act. Khanna argued the federal investment in companies like Intel yielded more than ten times as much in private dollars.
“We can do this for other industries,” he argued, “and we can do it in factory towns across this country.”
The benefit isn’t just improving the local tax base. He contends that economic development might begin to repair our politics. It’s difficult to despair when there are plenty of job opportunities, and a growing community breeds a sense of collective purpose.
But even as Khanna offered a collaborative vision for the future, the more competitive subtext was difficult to miss. At every turn, he emphasized Vice President J.D. Vance’s role shaping policy and rhetoric.
With President Trump constitutionally barred from a third term, Vance appears to be the party’s heir apparent. Khanna’s Midwest swing could be a campaign rehearsal — his effort to contrast his own vision against Vance’s hints at his own 2028 ambitions.
What attendees wanted to know
After speaking for about half an hour, several City Club attendees asked about several issues including immigration and economic policy.
On immigration, Khanna emphasized due process.
“I’m all for deporting people who have been convicted of violent crimes,” he said. “I just want to make sure we know whether they actually committed the violent crimes in the first place.”
Supreme Court says Trump administration must ‘facilitate’ return of wrongly deported man

Former Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera, who lives in Shaker Heights, asked about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador.
Khanna said if the Trump administration defies the Supreme Court order to facilitate Garcia’s return, that would precipitate a constitutional crisis. He pointed to Vance’s statements encouraging the president to ignore court orders.
“Even if you believe that people convicted of heinous crimes, as I do, should be deported, even if you believe that MS-13 gang members should be deported, you have to speak up for due process,” he said. “And even if you don’t agree with the due process, you have to speak up for listening to a Supreme Court in this country — the whole system depends on that.”
Other attendees asked if there’s really an appetite for rebuilding former factory towns among voters in places like Silicon Valley, which Khanna represents. And even if the political will exists, how do you avoid the red tape that has plagued industrial policy like the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure law?
Khanna acknowledged that permitting has been a problem but it’s only one challenge. Permitting reform is “not going to magically redevelop Ashtabula County,” he argued. Federal financing to train workers and support businesses will be necessary. And he said there’s a long tradition of pairing private and public investment stretching back to Alexander Hamilton.
“If we inspire the American public with a common mission,” Khanna said, “we will overcome the propaganda and the anger and the falseness of what Trump and Vance are selling.”
“People are angry. That’s why they’re looking for alternatives,” he added. “We need to inspire them with a real one.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)A former public official and an investment firm are defending themselves after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine spoke out about their conversations after our reporting exposed their close relationship.
Former retired teachers’ pension fund board member Wade Steen argued that nothing was inappropriate about his behavior, claiming the governor should be the one being looked into.
In an exclusive one-on-one interview, the governor finally addressed the alleged corruption scheme plaguing the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS).
The day after that sit-down, I spoke with Steen and Seth Metcalf, the head of QED, the investment firm at the center of the scandal.
For the past year, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), a roughly $100 billion pension fund for the more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers around former board member Wade Steen, board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum, and their relationship with investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
This piece will be formatted as a Q&A, as it features moments from the 15-minute interview. It has been lightly edited only for clarity and length, as well as to get to the crux of the comment.
How we got here
In May 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them.
They couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents said.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money — through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA, the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, had worked together, specifically when it comes to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been doing the bidding of QED.
The AG states that the pair should be removed because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and trust when “colluding” with QED.
In late August, Yost filed several subpoenas against QED and others allegedly involved in this scheme. The same month, QED spoke out to us for the first time, and so did the AG.
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of my investigations.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Texts between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel show that the pair consistently worked together. There are hundreds of text messages.
Texts show a group chat between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel. The pair constantly texted Steen during board meetings with advice, including numerous messages of “Vote!” and “Force the vote” when it came to policy and following QED.
“Thanks for the support today!” Steen said.
“Wade – you are a champion! We moved the ball down the field today and have time to recoup and refresh during the holiday!” Metcalf texted the group.

Our reporting stunned the governor, he said, so after more than a year of requesting an interview with him, he agreed to a date in April 2025.
Steen, QED, STRS responds to the governor
Morgan Trau: “There’s still a lot of support for you from the STRS board and from the pensioners. How do you feel now that there is still this support for reform?”
Wade Steen: “I’m happy that there’s support for reform. Everything I tried to do when I was on the board was restore [cost of living adjustments]. It was a benefit that was taken away… If I in any way contributed to getting that conversation started about how do we do a better job for the teachers in Ohio, I feel satisfied that I made a little bit of a difference.”
Originally appointed by former Gov. John Kasich, he was reappointed by DeWine when the governor started his administration, but the governor asked him to resign in 2023. Steen refused, so DeWine removed him. DeWine originally cited Steen’s alleged poor attendance at board meetings as reasoning.
However, a court ruled that DeWine did not have the legal authority to remove Steen based on Ohio law, and thus, Steen was put back on the board in the spring 2024.
I asked the governor during our interview why he had removed Steen, to which he reiterated that his attendance was unsatisfactory. Steen disagreed. However, I pressed DeWine on his updated statement from May 2024, months after the removal, in which his team said that there were concerns about Steen’s involvement with QED.
Trau: “Do you find that suspicious that he’s changing his mind now or do you think that this was always something that he was worried about? What do you take from that change?”
Steen: “I don’t know what I would take. When I got a call from his staff person… her comment, and it’s noted in numerous disclosures, was, ‘We want to go in a different direction.’ Didn’t say who ‘we’ was, and I asked what direction that was because I reiterated that I had met with the governor’s chief of staff just a few months prior, and the staff were very aware of what I was doing and what I was fighting for — which was for teachers. I said, ‘I don’t understand what’s this different direction?’ Never once did I get that answered. So if anything’s hung in the back of my mind, it’s ‘they wanted to go in a different direction.'”
On his removal, he notes that the governor and Yost argue that “they want the same things I was fighting for, which is shocking.”
Steen: “They want to restore cost of living, they want to improve performance, they want to make sure that the fund is doing the best job possible for teachers. I thought, ‘Wow, that’s exactly what I say,’ but they wanted to go in a different direction? Why the argument from attendance to something else, I don’t know. When my attendance was pulled, they found out that it was actually very good, and better than many, so, maybe they had to come up with a different reason… My attendance was never a problem, when I saw that I was a little surprised.”
I brought up to DeWine how Steen was removed during a critical election when the reformers took control of the board, and then he released the 14-page memo during another pivotal election when the reformers took a supermajority of the board. With this dominance, they would be able to start shifting the investment structure, something that reformers claim DeWine wants to prevent.
Throughout the past year, I’ve spoken to Steen about this — in which he argues that the governor wants to prevent true reform. Steen’s supporters say the removal was to “silence” him.
The governor insists he has no reason to stop reform, but rather, he wants to stop possibly corrupt activity. The texts paint a picture between Steen and Metcalf that was “disconcerting,” DeWine said.
Hundreds of texts show Metcalf gave Steen questions to ask during board meetings, documents to propose, and pushed him to follow QED’s plan.
“I think we can win this but I need to nuisance it,” Steen texted in 2020, as he was pitching QED’s proposal.
“I think you’ve got the votes! Make the motion! Announce that you have a solution,” Metcalf responded.
Metcalf continually texted talking points, themes and direct quotes for Steen to follow while he was in the board meetings.
Steen followed his lead.
Trau: “Do you think that they were appropriate?”
Steen: “Absolutely. I had conversations not just with Seth Metcalf, but with numerous people. Part of my job as a board member is to try to get information, know as much as I can. And as has been documented and you noted, I knew Seth from years prior — we go to the same church… So for me to try to better understand what’s going on or ask people’s opinion — whether it would be our staff, whether it be Seth Metcalf as an individual, whether it would be other people that are in the investment field that I know that never get mentioned — I didn’t find that unusual.”
He doesn’t know why his relationship with Metcalf was “the focus,” he added.
Steen: “I ask a lot of people a lot of questions. The question I would have is, if you read the letter, the anonymous letter, from 2021 on, information had been provided by STRS staff to the attorney general. So for more than three years, they’ve been getting all kinds of information. Nothing in the letter is new, and yet here we sit a year after the attorney general made allegations and brought charges, and there’s nothing — because there is nothing, there’s no merit to it. It’s almost weaponization… But clearly, if there was something, I would think in three years you would have some evidence. They clearly have none other than ‘He spoke to this person.’ OK, well, I spoke to a lot of people.'”
He was removed in 2023, so he missed some time, and then was not reappointed — so he has begun to “move on,” he added.
Steen: “I feel like I did make a small contribution toward fighting for teacher benefits for retirees and trying to improve benefits in the future for active teachers not receiving them yet. I take some satisfaction in that, but my term’s done.”
He is focused on his job as chief financial officer of the Cleveland Metroparks and spending time with his grandchildren, he added.
Steen: “I really haven’t thought much about it since then, other than when we have to file something in the court because these cases, as I understand, drag on for some period of time.”
I brought up how the governor pointed out that QED was specifically trying to get a job.
Trau: “QED was specifically trying to get money for their startup to be able to work with you and work with STRS on investing. That’s where he says it crosses a line.”
Steen: “I don’t know how to respond to that. I guess that the issue that I kept raising — I think everybody keeps missing — is that we have non-disclosure agreements with numerous groups that we make investments with, and I have been outspoken that there needs to be transparency, and yet no one, governor, AG, staff seem to be concerned about the fact that… investment staff make investments and the board does not know the details of those investments and are not provided when asked, they are denied access to that information.
He continued.
Steen: “And so, Morgan, I’d ask you as a reporter — does that concern you? That was really the crux of what started so much of this was, ‘What are our fees with the hedge funds? What is in the agreements?’ and at every turn I was denied, denied, denied. That’s all I wanted — I wanted transparency. I want to know what are we investing in, who’s benefiting from this?”
He was roadblocked on numerous occasions from trying to get information on investments from staff and information on how bonuses are given to staff members. Other information he wanted falls under different types of trade information and, thus, isn’t disclosed.
Steen: “I don’t want to say something is there because I don’t know — I don’t know what’s there because we were never provided. I was never provided that information.”
When it comes to Metcalf, he denied knowing whether they fully wanted a job.
Steen: “Whether or not QED was trying to get work, I guess people could say they were. I was intrigued by the idea.”
Going on to say that in the 14-page memo, staff acknowledged they do something similar to QED’s idea, so this wasn’t out of the realm of the norm. I could not substantiate that through my multiple readings of the memo. The closest thing I found to that is the staff noting that it “was familiar with the use of similar strategies on a much smaller scale but was not aware they could achieve anywhere near the results suggested.”
The former board member said that the investing didn’t have to be with QED; he was just wondering if the “idea has merit,” he said.
Steen: “I was pushing for more performance… I wanted our expenses done and I wanted our results better. That’s what I think every oversight body should do — how do we do better? What ideas can we take from others and implement here. But, if that’s the assertion — that I was trying to secure work for one person, that’s not accurate. I wanted to know more about this idea. Was there merit? But the bigger idea was ‘How do we restore cola for our retirees?’ How do we restore benefits that were taken away from them? How do we do better time and again?”
He was removed for questioning the staff, he said.
Steen: “If someone tries to remove me, if someone tries to attack me because I’m asking how we do better, I guess I’ll wear that because If I were on the board today, I would continue to say, ‘How do we do better for teachers.’ You’ve watched the meetings and you’ve been around, Morgan, long enough to know and see the questions I asked. I was pretty direct on my question about how do we do better? I think sometimes that made staff uncomfortable that they were being held into account, whether it be staff or consultants about how do we do better — they didn’t really have a good answer.”
I referenced how Steen said he would speak to multiple people for advice. In reference to Metcalf, he asked for edits on documents; he was given “themes” to bring up during meetings.
Trau: “How would you categorize or characterize that relationship?”
Steen: “Probably nothing more than input, like I would get through reading information, calling people that I know that do institutional investments in town for private sector pension funds and others — just personal friends. ‘Hey, what do you guys think about this? What do you think about that idea? What do you think about the way we pay our bonus structure,’ that kind of thing… So those are the kind of things that people would tell me that just raised questions for me.”
He continued.
Steen: “But to your question, how would I categorize? Just someone I bounce an idea off of like anyone else. People would send me their thoughts, talk to me, go have coffee… I spent a lot of time trying to really understand what we were doing, what we were tasked with. I was really trying to do my job as a board member. But back to my relationship — it would be one where I was just seeking input or advice. That was all.”
Trau: “Were you talking with other people during board meetings that were giving you direct quotes to say or they were giving you ideas on motions?”
Steen: “No, I wasn’t — I didn’t — no, no.”
Then we got on the topic of DeWine’s history with text messages.
Now-indicted FirstEnergy executives allegedly worked with DeWine and his team to pass legislation that was the result of the largest corruption scheme in state history, according to newly released text messages. DeWine denies knowing House Bill 6 was a bribe.
A public records request reveals that DeWine communicated frequently during his first run for governor with former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones and VP Michael Dowling.
The pair held lavish fundraisers before he was elected, with Jones giving speeches about how DeWine would be great for “his company and shareholders,” a speech I received said. Plus, Jones provided the now-governor money when he asked.
“Chuck. Can you call me?” DeWine wrote on Oct. 13, 2018 — less than a month before he faced off against Democrat Rich Cordray in the governor’s race. “OEA put in million yesterday for Cordray.”
“OK,” Jones responded. “I’ll call at 2:30.”
Three days later, Dowling texted Jones and said, “Chuck — go ahead and call Mike DeWine on the $500k. It’s going to RGA’s C(4) called state solutions. All set.”
Jones responds, “OK. I’ll call him around 5.”
I explained to Steen how DeWine said the conversations were very different because FirstEnergy was just helping DeWine in an “individual” sense, whereas QED wants a job. Click here to read more of the governor’s stance.
Steen didn’t want to fully comment without knowing the entire quotation but did critique the governor — as many reformers do regarding the H.B. 6 scandal.
Steen: “I think they’re even more different in that his relationship with Chuck Jones is much different. He was getting something from Chuck Jones. Chuck Jones gave him a campaign contribution. I got nothing. Again, three years of investigation. The assertion was ‘Wade had a relationship.’ The assertion was ‘Wade got something.’ The assertion was something was offered. Morgan, unless I’ve missed it, none of that’s true. There’s no evidence to that. The governor got a campaign contribution from First Energy, correct?”


Trau: “Got a few.”


Steen: “Yeah, so if there is a difference — he got something… They are quite different. He’s the governor. I’m a volunteer board member — just who we are in our positions is a lot different, too. I mean, the amount of authority and power one has, he’s the governor, he got campaign contributions. I’m just a volunteer board member trying to work hard for teachers. It’s interesting how, somehow, one’s volunteer service somehow becomes this negative — that they have to wear this attack upon them. I guess the better question is why the attack upon me? Because I talked to one person? If you think about it and step back and and view it through that lens — why were they after this person so much?”
Trau: “Why do you think?”
Steen: “I’m not at liberty to say because our cases are still pending, but things are still moving forward.”
What Steen didn’t acknowledge was the fact that he has received thousands of dollars to fight his legal battle against not just his original removal from the board, but also the AG’s lawsuit.
Robin Rayfield, who runs ORTA, put together a fund in 2023 to pay Steen’s fees.
“I communicated with Wade,” Rayfield said in an interview with me in May 2024. “I said, ‘Well, do you wanna fight this?’ And he goes, ‘Let me think about it because fighting the governor is a tough thing to do…’ But nonetheless, we stood with Wade and I said, ‘Well, ORTA could potentially help you fight this.”
Case Western Reserve University business law professor Eric Chaffee explained that this raises red flags.
“If you have certain benefits being paid to an individual, who’s supposed to represent a complete group of people, from a segment of that group of people, it creates concerns that there are going to be policies that favor them,” Chaffee said.
Last year, I obtained thank you cards that Steen wrote to pensioners for donating to his legal fund, adding that the “generous financial contribution” will allow him to “deliver” for teachers.
ORTA leader Robin Rayfield told me they ended up raising more than $80,000 for Steen — but they recently started fundraising for Fichtenbaum due to the AG’s lawsuit involving him as well as Steen.
In September, ORTA finally filled out the lobbying expenditures requirement. It showed that, in total, they spent about $115,000 to support the two men. About $87,000 went to Steen, and $27,000 went to Fichtenbaum.
“In 23 years of reviewing lobbying expenditures, this is a complete outlier — we’ve seen nothing comparable,” Legislative Inspector General Tony Bledsoe told me during our report exposing the money.
This means both Steen and Fichtenbaum, the chair, are using donations from a section of members to pay their legal fees.
After telling me he had to get onto another call, abruptly ending the interview, Steen added that the H.B. 6 scandal should be the story to focus on.
I was able to squeeze in one final question.
Trau: “Are you interested in going back on the board or being executive director or CIO?”
Steen: “No, I’m very happy in what I’m doing here at the Metroparks.”
Metcalf declined an interview but did provide a statement.
“I’m grateful this matter is now in a court of law, where the evidence will show that QED’s interactions with the STRS board were lawful, ethical and appropriate,” Metcalf emailed. “Whistleblowers Steen and Fichtenbaum collaborated with QED to unravel a web of misinformation and expose a system enriching STRS employees at the expense of Ohio educators.”
I also reached out to the STRS team to ask them how they viewed the conversations between Steen and QED.
Their spokesperson told me they don’t comment on pending litigation, but provided a copy of their ethics policy, which includes provisions stating that no one on the board can “Vote, authorize, recommend, or in any other way use his or her position to secure approval of a Board or System contract (including employment or personal services) in which the Board Member or employee, a family member, or anyone with whom the Board Member or employee has a business or employment relationship, has an interest; Solicit or accept any compensation, except as allowed by law, to perform his or her official duties or any act or service in his or her official capacity; Solicit or accept anything of value from anyone doing business with the Board or System.”
There is no evidence of any kickbacks, Steen and QED argue, so this wouldn’t apply.

Here’s what communities are losing.,Nada Hassanein,,,,,https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2025/04/15/trump-has-canceled-environmental-justice-grants-heres-what-communities-are-losing/,"Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems, and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits, and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts, and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing, and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.
CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

Mike DeWine is deeply concerned following a recent report in which we revealed hundreds of text messages of the relationship between a public official and an investment firm seeking to get access to tens of billions of dollars from the state. In an exclusive one-on-one interview, the governor finally addressed the alleged corruption scheme plaguing the retired teachers’ pension fund.
“You’re still on this story, huh?” the governor said to me as we were getting started with our 30-minute interview. “While others have lost attention — you stayed on it.”
For the past year, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), a roughly $100 billion pension fund for the more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers around former board member Wade Steen, board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum, and their relationship with investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
This piece will be formatted as a Q&A, featuring moments from the half-hour interview. It has been lightly edited only for clarity and length, as well as to get to the crux of the comment.
Wade Steen and Seth Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them.
They couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and also because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents say.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money — through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA, the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, had worked together, specifically when it comes to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
The AG states that the pair should be removed because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and trust when “colluding” with QED.
In late August, Yost filed several subpoenas against QED and others allegedly involved in this scheme. The same month, QED spoke out to us for the first time, and so did the AG.
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of my investigations.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Texts between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel show that the pair consistently worked together. There are hundreds of text messages.
Texts show a group chat between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel. The pair constantly texted Steen during board meetings with advice, including numerous messages of “Vote!” and “Force the vote” when it came to policy and following QED.
“Thanks for the support today!” Steen said.
“Wade – you are a champion! We moved the ball down the field today and have time to recoup and refresh during the holiday!” Metcalf texted the group.
Our reporting stunned the governor, he said, so after more than a year of requesting an interview with him, he agreed to a date in April 2025.
The governor responds
Why are we here? For the teachers to have money when they retire, DeWine said.
Morgan Trau: “What is the importance of a healthy pension fund?”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine: “It’s very important we have state systems, and this is the teachers’ retirement fund, and we certainly want that to be a sound fund. That’s always, always something that’s a concern, and retired teachers have been concerned about not getting cost of living allowances in the past. The stability of a retirement fund, I think, is very important. It’s not just the stability from an economic point, this is an area where stability and less drama is good.”
Trau: “Clearly, if we look at the past two years, drama encapsulates what has been happening at STRS. What is going on from your perspective?”
DeWine: “Well, I think things have calmed down. I’m looking at it from afar, but it seems that the board is working, and working in a productive way. I think we’ve, at least for a while now, we’ve come over from that problem that we’ve had in the past.”
The problems worsened in 2023. Initially appointed by former Gov. John Kasich, Steen has become somewhat of a martyr, many reformers told me. He was reappointed by DeWine when the governor started his administration, but the governor asked him to resign in 2023. Steen refused, so DeWine removed him. DeWine initially cited Steen’s alleged poor attendance at board meetings as reasoning.
However, a court ruled that DeWine did not have the legal authority to remove Steen based on Ohio law, and thus, Steen was put back on the board in the spring 2024.
I asked the governor during our interview why he had removed Steen, to which he reiterated that his attendance was satisfactory. Steen disagreed.
Trau: “When I talked with your team in May of 2024, they told me that there was also a concern about his close relationship with the investment firm QED and that led you to have doubt in his fiduciary duty.”
DeWine: “Well, there certainly was some information going around in regard to that, of course. Then when we got the document, it was an anonymous document, but it seemed to be well informed and I felt I wanted to, frankly, get that document over to elected officials who might have an interest in investigating or might have an obligation to investigate it.”
Trau: “When it comes to the pension fund and the allegations that are against former board members, the current board chair – what kind of outcome could happen if these allegations are all true?
DeWine: “Well, I don’t really know. I’ve not followed the attorney general’s suit that closely, but when you look at what you have been able to uncover, the things that have been filed in court… I would just call it a concerning set of facts. It’s very concerning that you have that close a relationship, going back and forth between a member of the board and the company that wants a job, basically. They want to be hired and clearly, you see [Seth] Metcalf, for example, going back and forth. It just seems to me that that’s very, very disconcerting. It’s very upsetting, and it raises a lot of questions. Now, we’ll see where the lawsuit goes and we’ll see what the final verdict is. I’m not going to prejudge that at all, but based upon what you are reporting — yeah, it doesn’t look very good.”
Pulling out some of the text messages I obtained, I passed the documents to the governor to look through.
Hundreds of texts show Metcalf gave Steen questions to ask during board meetings, documents to propose, and pushed him to follow QED’s plan.
“I think we can win this but I need to nuisance it,” Steen texted in 2020, as he was pitching QED’s proposal.
“I think you’ve got the votes! Make the motion! Announce that you have a solution,” Metcalf responded.
Metcalf continually texted talking points, themes and direct quotes for Steen to follow while he was in the board meetings.
Steen followed his lead.
Trau: “What do you think about the fact that they were giving directions during board meetings and they were giving quotes to say and those quotes were then said out loud?”
DeWine: “It would be highly, highly, highly unusual for that to happen. A member of the board has a fiduciary obligation to all the people he or she represents. They have an obligation to the retired teachers. They have an obligation to people who are currently putting their money into that — current teachers. So, for that person to have that close of relationship with a person who is basically coming to the board and saying ‘Hire us, we know what we’re doing,’ – yeah, it’s not a normal situation, let’s put it that way. Again, I can’t judge it. All I can tell you is what you have seen and what you’ve pulled from the court documents.”
Evaluating the text message threads with numerous legal and pension industry experts, each indicated suspicion, with Case Western Reserve University law professor, joined by others, adding that this could be used to argue there was a level of coordination.
Trau: “You are an attorney, and when you look at this, does this look like coordination to you?”
DeWine: “Well, I’m not gonna draw any legal conclusions, but just knowing what each role these players are supposed to be playing – they’re not playing their normal roles. That’s not what we would normally expect… The member of the board is supposed to be impartial and supposed to be making a judgment call based upon what is in the best interest of STRS, in this case, and ultimately in the retired teachers.”
I referenced how familiar Metcalf and Steen spoke to each other.
Trau: “Should we be paying attention to the language that this investment firm is using when talking to a board member?”
DeWine: “Well, it’s unusual language — let’s just put it that way.”
Trau: “Obviously, there are people who back Wade Steen extensively. There has been a legal fund with thousands of dollars given to him to fight the removal and to fight this current lawsuit against Attorney General Dave Yost. Some of these people, even with these text messages, say that this is political interference. How do you gain back the trust of these pensioners that believe that you and AG Dave Yost are wrong?
DeWine: “Well, the only concern I’ve always had is for the board to function well and to make good judgments, do the best that they could for the retired teachers. I see retired teachers all the time. They’ve worked very, very hard. Teachers are the people that educate our kids. Everybody can remember a teacher, more than one teacher, who literally changed their life. These are important people and we need to do the best we can for them.
I don’t want to be a member of the board. I’m not looking over everybody’s shoulder. We just have to have a functioning board, that makes decisions based upon what is in the best interest of these teachers. When they pick the investment advisors, you would think that they would be picking people who are experienced and people who have a good track record. You’re not always going to be successful with every investment, but what you have to look at is the totality of the investments.”
Trau: “Do you feel vindicated by the texts coming out?”
DeWine: “Well, I don’t know if vindicated. Look, we’re simply after what’s best for the retired teachers.”
I noted how DeWine removed Steen during a critical election when the reformers took control of the board and then released the 14-page memo during another pivotal election when the reformers took a supermajority of the board. With this dominance, they would be able to start shifting the investment structure, something that reformers claim DeWine wants to prevent.
Trau: “Some argue that that timing is suspicious. Could you see why they would say that?”
DeWine: “Well, it’s not true. We were trying to get the information out, for example, in regard to the memo we got. We, very quickly, got it over to six different officials, public officials, who we thought and believe they do have investigative authority, or have the ability to act, upon that memo. I really did not have the ability to act upon that memo… When you see very serious allegations like that, we have to get that document over to the people who have an obligation to take action.”
I referenced the reformers’ goal of switching the investment structure.
Trau: “Do you think that that would yield better results than right now? And should they have had the opportunity, if the majority on the board wants to do that, should they be able to do that?”
DeWine: “Well, if the majority wants to do that they certainly can do that. For the average citizen, I think investing in the stock market, following investment in funds that allow you basically to get the return or lack of return that the whole stock market is getting, that makes some sense… Pension funds take a more conservative point of view. They have to be paying out so much money every single month, they have to be paying out every single year, and they don’t want to have a great risk, so they will be much more diversified even than that… And what Metcalf was selling was something that would be very, very unusual for a pension fund.”
I noted Metcalf’s history, asking why the governor thinks someone may be entered in giving 70% of a pension fund to a startup without the technology to pull off the plan. DeWine emphasized how Metcalf was not qualified.
There are real, valid concerns from educators — DeWine acknowledged — but as we have reported, STRS is doing better than most of the other state pension funds.
“I do hear from teachers about how much the advisors were getting paid,” the governor said. “I think you have some people who are just looking at this and saying, ‘Look, these people are paid too much money,’ and look, those are legitimate discussions that people can have and they can believe they’re getting too much or you can argue they’re not getting too much. But those are, I think, some of the reasons that people were getting upset.”
The investment staff get paid by salary and performance-based incentives (PBIs). Losing these bonuses could slash up to half of their salary, former STRS chief actuary Brian Grinnell told me in July.
The average yearly “salary” for STRS investment staff members was roughly $230,300, that number including PBIs, as they have typically been approved for $10 million in bonuses per year. The board voted to eliminate the PBIs to make the reformers happy, resulting in their major compensation advisor quitting and their fiduciary counsel telling them they were violating the law. They reinstated them soon after.
But it’s been a tough few years financially, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. I noted this, the current look at the stock market, inflation, and the fiscal hits people faced from COVID. COLA could help retired teachers. The Retirement Study Council said they are on track to restore it in a decade fully.
Trau: “People are suffering with this and they are very upset. They are, many of them, blaming you for this oversight of the board. Is that fair?”
DeWine: “Well, I get one person on the board, so I only have one person on the board that I appoint. I guess you can blame the governor for anything, but my concern has been the same and my goal has been the same — and that is to have board members who are going to focus every single day on the best interest of the retired teachers.”
Referencing how DeWine had said the board had calmed down, I mentioned their attempt to hire a consultant firm without relevant experience with ties to the board members. Our investigation disqualified them due to their staff contacting the board members during a “blackout period,” when the interview process is underway and communicating isn’t allowed.
Trau: “Are we not looking at it seriously by saying that it’s calming down?”
DeWine: “Well, everything is relative. It certainly calmed down some. If I was a member of the board, I think I would remember my fiduciary obligation to the retired teachers and every decision I made doesn’t mean every decision will be right, but what I would have in my mind every single day, every time I went to the committee meeting, every time I attended the meeting, every time I thought about this, ‘What’s in the best interest of the teachers and what should these investments be and who should be advising us.’”
Trau: “Some lawmakers have suggested that due to the controversy that is happening right now with the board, some of the voting power should be taken away from the educators — making them members of the board but just not voting members or taking down how many people. The teachers say that that would be undemocratic. Where do you stand?”
DeWine: “Well, I’m not advocating any kind of change. The board members are not experts, their job is to hire experts… Their job is to pick the right people who have a track record of investment and continue to have that oversight that the board should have.”
Talking about hiring the right people, I brought up the text messages and how QED still wants a job. Metcalf has said that their plan will work to bring in money, and they can make it better. Regarding the messages, I followed up with the governor on his concerns.
Trau: “When did you think it was unusual, was there a specific text message or was it just overall?
DeWine: “Well, you’re talking about what you pulled from the filings. Frankly, you put it all together in a form that people could read it. So I didn’t read all those, I didn’t have those pulled. I read it when you had it put together and you had all those laid out… Once you read it, I think anybody reads it, would be concerned about it.”
Trau: “When I’ve talked with QED, they’ve said that there’s nothing illegal about potentially acting as consultants or advisors to Steen because they say they know more than him when it comes to the investment structure. Do you believe that you know he could just be talking to them for advice?
DeWine: “Well, I think people can come up with their own conclusions on that.”
Trau: “What’s yours?”
DeWine: “Well, l again, I don’t know what’s in someone’s heart. I don’t know what’s in their mind. I just know that is a very unusual relationship, a very close unusual relationship.”
The governor wouldn’t comment on whether Metcalf, who worked in state government for years, should have known better than to communicate with a board member in the way he did.
Trau: “Some critics argue that with your text messages with FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, [where] they ended up putting $500,000 in a dark money PAC for you, some argue that there’s no difference between that and QED contacting. Is that fair?”
DeWine: “No, I don’t think so. What we did is perfect, perfectly legal. You report contributions.”
A public records request reveals that DeWine communicated frequently during his first run for governor with Jones and VP Michael Dowling. The pair held lavish fundraisers before he was elected, with Jones giving speeches about how DeWine would be great for “his company and shareholders,” a speech I received said. Plus, Jones provided the now-governor money when he asked.
Referencing QED, I followed up. We had, earlier, talked about his thoughts on if there was a campaign waged behind the scenes to get certain people elected. He said he didn’t know.
Trau: “Are you saying that there might be some financial involvement?”
DeWine: “I’m not alleging anything about what they were doing… People have a right to wage a campaign as long as they stay within the law. They have a right to raise money and they have a right to push somebody to be on STRS’ board. To my knowledge that, per se, is nothing illegal about that. This is a free country. People have the right to speak out and they have the right to give money to a candidate and they have the right to advocate for that candidate.”
Trau: “But the same people argue that the closeness in your relationship with FirstEnergy executives could be comparable to QED and Wade Steen, Rudy Fichtenbaum.”
DeWine: “Well, it’s a different situation. I mean the situation in regard to the board is that these two members of the board have a fiduciary relationship and a fiduciary obligation. And you have someone who is pitching them, not in their individual capacity. They weren’t going to hire them to do their individual work. They were going to hire them as a member of the board and that is what is questionable I think.”
Through a short back-and-forth, I clarified with DeWine about why he thought the communication was different.
“I think it is really comparing apples and pears or something, I think it’s really different,” DeWine continued. “This is a board which has a fiduciary obligation… They have a legal obligation to give their best judgment, so you read that and draw your own conclusions from that.”
I brought up the future for Steen since he had told me during his last meeting for the board that he wasn’t sure if he was entirely done with STRS yet. His supporters have suggested him for the executive director role, CFO, or CIO.
“Whether it’s a wise move or not it’s a different question,” the governor answered. “I think it’d be a mistake to put Steen back on there. I’m not going to reappoint him.”
Trau: “Moving forward, it seems the board has realized they can’t do everything that they want to do with totally changing how the investment structure works. Do you think that this is going to have to be an ongoing process where eyes are on it at all times because people could still try to hire their friends?”
DeWine: “Well, I think the public’s eyes, thanks to you… are on them, and that’s always a good thing, They have to make these decisions out in public so I think that’s that’s a good thing.”
We also touched on Signal, an encrypted app that deletes conversations within a set period of time. QED used Signal frequently to speak to Steen and Fichetnbaum, even recently as last year. They used it to talk to me, too, until I reported the existence of Fichtenbaum’s deleted messages to them.
Trau: “Should public officials be allowed to be using apps where they delete and they’re encrypted?
DeWine: “Well, we’ve got pretty good strong laws today, as you know. No matter what your means of conveyance, that really doesn’t matter. That doesn’t give you any legal protection. What makes you, makes the news media or anybody in the public, able to get information is if you were acting in your official capacity.”
Trau: “Sure, we have them when they exist, but when it’s Signal and they delete automatically within reading of them — should there be a prohibition on the fact that they can delete without being under FOIA (Freedom of Information Act that allows the public to records request and get access to documents)?
DeWine: “Look, as technology changes and it advances or regresses depending on how you want to look at it, we constantly should be looking at, see what needs to be changed. But I don’t know in this case whether that should be changed or not.”
Trau: “What do you think could be the best outcome in this situation to prevent against corruption under STRS?”
DeWine: “Well, the best outcome could be if there continues to be light on the subject, as they say, and these decisions are made out in the public. I mean, people are paying attention. You’re paying attention… That’s a good thing.”
He noted the unpredictability of being tied to the stock market, especially now. It is good to have a diversified portfolio, he added.
Trau: “How do you get people to believe you when they think that you’re trying to interfere against reform?”
DeWine: “Well, I have no reason to interfere against reform. I have every reason to try to make sure the retired teachers get a good deal, and that they’re taken care of… What I don’t want is to see chaos on that board, and what I don’t want is bad investments and people be hired who do not have the experience to make those investments.”
Trau: “What would your goal be? What is your one thing that you would want to say in this interview to pensioners and people who are struggling with the fact that they don’t know what’s going on?”
DeWine: “Well, I think the opportunity to know what’s going on is better than it was. I think people are paying attention to this board, they’re looking at it and that’s a good thing. It’s a very, very good thing.”

Wes Moore (D) to veto legislation that reduces the financial awards to victims of institutional abuse — but also rushing other claims to court before a May 31 deadline in case he signs it.
The call for a veto came as those same attorneys announced nearly two dozen new lawsuits Monday against one Catholic high school in Baltimore County. Robert K. Jenner, managing partner at Baltimore-based Jenner Law, called on Moore to reject the bill that was rushed through the final days of the 2025 Maryland General Assembly session.
“It breaks the faith with the thousands of survivors who have come forward believing that the state of Maryland was on their side and ready to hold perpetrators accountable,” said Jenner, one of roughly a half-dozen attorneys who spoke during a news conference at his firm’s Baltimore office.
But a Moore spokesperson said Monday that while the governor “acknowledges the trauma survivors of child sexual assault have endured and the difficult and unprecedented circumstances surrounding this legislation,” a veto is off the table.
“The General Assembly has carefully crafted legislation that will continue to allow the survivors to seek justice while preserving the long-term fiscal stability of the state,” the spokesperson said in an emai. “The governor will sign this legislation.”
House Bill 1378 passed both the House and Senate by veto-proof majorities.
While the attorneys decried the passage of House Bill 1378 , they said they are not waiting for Moore to veto the bill. The attorneys — part of a coalition calling themselves the Calvert Hall Lawyers Working Group — announced roughly two dozen new lawsuits against Towson-based Calvert Hall College High School.

Emily C. Malarkey, a partner at Baltimore-based Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin, said the new lawsuits represent what could potentially be a rush to file before the new law — with its lower caps on damages — takes effect.
“We’re working 24/7, for the next six weeks to get all our clients’ cases filed,” Malarkey said in an interview. “If we wait until June 1, their cap is going to drop in half, and we’re not going to do that to them. We’re going to work our butts off to get it done.”
Jenner praised the 2023 law, sponsored by Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) as well as a Supreme Court of Maryland ruling this year that held the law was constitutional. Wilson also sponsored HB1378, out of concern that potential settlements under the 2023 law could bust the state budget. It’s legislation that Jenner and other attorneys opposed.
“Finally, we thought we had a path to justice but here we are. A landmark victory for survivors that we thought ended the question has now been gutted. But this isn’t about budget math. This is about moral clarity. This is about a promise that the state of Maryland made and is now poised to break,” Jenner said.
The 2025 bill as passed “slashes the amount survivors can recover by jury, verdict or by settlement, and it limits them to a single payment when they have been abused several times, multiple times by the same perpetrator,” he said.
Malarkey’s firm on Monday filed a lawsuit on behalf of 14 clients against Towson-based Calvert Hall College High School. The lawsuit also names as defendants the Brothers of the Christian Schools, District of Eastern North America, and the Christian Brothers of Frederick. Both entities were responsible for managing and operating Calvert Hall.
The 45-page filing includes allegations of abuse against four members of the clergy — Brother Geoffrey Xavier Langan and the Revs. Laurence Brett, Jerome Toohey and Francis LeFevre. All four were named in a 463-page report on child sexual abuse in the Archdiocese of Baltimore released in 2023 by the Office of the Attorney General.
Stephen E. Arnold, a lay science instructor at Calvert Hall is also named as an abuser in the lawsuit filed Monday.
The claims filed Monday would come in under the current law, which said victims of abuse in private institutions could file a lawsuit at any time, and capped damages at $1.5 million per “occurrence” — a term over which plaintiff’s attorneys and some lawmakers disagree. For state and local government entities, the cap was set at $890,000 per occurrence.
Assuming Moore makes good on his promise to sign HB1378 into law, claims filed after June 1 would be capped at $700,000 for private institutions and $400,000 for public institutions The changes came after legislative analysts warned of the potential “enormous liability” stemming from claims against state institutions.

Those analysts said in January that there could be as many as 3,500 claims. And while they did not provide a potential price tag, conservative estimates initially set the amount at about $3.1 billion — an amount roughly equal to the structural budget deficit.
The actual amount of potential liability is not fully known.
The Child Victim’s Act, passed in 2023, was the result of a decade of effort to allow victims — who were children at the time they were assaulted — to file lawsuits that were otherwise time-barred. At the time, most of the focus was on survivors of abuse who made allegations against the Catholic Church.
The bill was praised at the time by Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D).
But the potential for liabilities grew as attorneys for those with claims argued that “per occurrence” meant each individual instance of sexual assault. Others argued for a more conservative definition that would combine assaults based on other factors. The result would be a reduction of the total amount a jury could potentially award.
The Archdiocese of Baltimore quickly sought bankruptcy protection before the law could take effect in October 2023.
At the same time, cases against the state were also making their way to the courthouse. One group of attorneys earlier this year told Maryland Matters they were representing roughly 4,500 claimants. If each one had just one claim of abuse and received the maximum award, the potential liability to the state is an estimated $4 billion.
“I could have never comprehended 4,500 claimants, and it’s an open door with another 1,500 in the hopper,” Wilson said in an interview earlier this year. He wondered aloud about “how much are taxpayers going to be on the hook for this?”
Those attorneys said many clients have more than one allegation of abuse. They also said that they have been in settlement discussions with the attorney general’s office. Those attorneys declined to provide details on the amount they were seeking, but said it was less than even what legislative analysts hinted at in January.
The Maryland attorneys are not the first to move cases to the courthouse. Levy Konigsberg, a New York-based law firm, filed lawsuits on behalf of 221 men and women the day after Maryland lawmakers adjourned the 2025 legislative session. All of the cases focus on allegations of sexual abuse at 15 state juvenile detention facilities.
The lawsuits bring the number of claims to roughly 2,000, according to the firm. Levy Konigsberg represents about 1,000 people who allege they were sexually abused while in state custody.

Ford Carr, D-Wichita, enters a hearing room on April 9, 2025. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Rep. Ford Carr and supporters in the gallery for his disciplinary hearing must have felt as though Kehlani and Dreamville penned the lyrics of their haunting 2023 R&B hit “Shadows,” about them. The hearing unfolded with painful familiarity and hypocrisy. 
Tropes, hundreds of years old. Ancient double standards. Selective outrage. 
Those there supporting Carr had decades of the Black experience in the workplace under their belts and, like him, have had to walk around with their defensive dukes up. Jobs are minefields, where your ability to clothe and feed loved ones often is arbitrarily threatened. 
The song opens: 
I can tell 
That there’s something lurking in the dark 
I can tell 
That you’re tryna catch me off guard
Carr, a Wichita Democrat, isn’t the most sympathetic symbol. Video taken at a Topeka pub in January captured a stream of bile and aggression rarely heard or seen away from a street corner.  
I’ve come to know Carr fairly well since he started at the Statehouse, and we’ve worked together on various projects. He’s complex. He’s an engineer and a martial artist. He revealed during the hearing how his father was killed.
He was accused of a broad pattern of menacing behavior, but he’s not the one denying people health care. He’s not the one denying children summer school meals. He’s not the one hellbent on destroying public education. 
Claims that he created a negative environment feel galling coming from his accusers. 
Supporters love Carr’s pugilistic style but worry about his defaults to coarse language and physical confrontation. They also know he’s on the right side of issues and that he won’t show up to a knife fight with pom pons. 
Supporters also recognize the games his opponents are playing with his House seat, with his character and with his constituents. Like him, they’ve likely said: 
And I’m trying my best, my best to keep from going under
And it’s hard to forget 
All the rain when we keep hearing the thunder 
It just feels like shadows keep following me 



Carr’s supporters had a larger concern: how Black people with strong, culturally authentic voices, from Malcolm X in the 1960s to Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett today, get policed.  
There’s always a color tax. Whatever problem you have in this society, if you add Black, your situation worsens. Our mistakes cost us more. Our achievements mean less. 
Carr touched on this during the hearing. He said of the more than 6,000 people who have served as legislators, only 128 were Black, or 2.13%. That percentage represents more than 90 percent of legislators hauled into hearings like his. 
The hearing began with an explicit show of force from Capitol police positioned in the corners of the room. 
The police presence brought back a scene from the book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, where police intimidated a client’s supporters before a hearing with police dogs. Many remembered police unleashing dogs on peaceful civil rights protesters. 
Then, a condescending warning from Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Lewis. 
“This is not a political rally,” Lewis said.
Lewis controlled everything from meeting times (changed multiple times without concern for Wichita constituents), meeting rooms (changed multiple times) and what evidence he would allow. 
That exclusion also felt familiar. African Americans represent America’s “exceptionalism” because the rights much of the country sings about while wrapping themselves in the flag, apply to everyone — except us. 
It’s why “patriots” reflexively oppose civil rights. Whenever they exalt this nation, there sit Black people bearing the scars of America’s worst impulses. That’s why so many eagerly want to bury evidence of those misdeeds. It is not just that they don’t understand. They don’t want to understand so they can luxuriate in blissful ignorance of what others must confront daily. We occupy separate realities. 
Consider the presence of Republican Rep. Leah Howell, Carr’s accuser. 
Howell is a small white woman. She appeared in the same hearing room as the towering Carr, a Black man. Her complaint reminded me of historical dog whistles, some made famous by the racist film Birth of a Nation.
Rep. Henry Helgerson, the Democrat whom Carr pushed down during that bar fracas, didn’t file a complaint. Howell did so instead. The same bar video showed Howell patting Carr’s shoulder as tempers raged. 
It would seem difficult to claim fear after doing that, but Howell did so, saying tearfully that “her conscience” compelled her to speak out, adding that she would have done the same thing had a Republican acted in similar fashion. 
Only, she didn’t. 
In February, Republican Rep. Nick Hoheisel aggressively approached Carr, uttering profanity on the House floor. She filed no complaint. 
Howell also invoked racism, which felt appropriate given that many Black Wichitans know her district for its overt racism. 
During the past few decades, a cross was burned in a family’s yard; residents protested the disciplining of a white child who had drawn a Confederate Battle Flag; parents hounded an educator for showing a diversity film; Black athletes have complained of crowds racially jeering at them. A mother there said bullying led her daughter to attempt suicide. 
Suddenly Howell’s conscience is calling? Sounds more like selective outrage. 
Kansas Reflector reported in February for example, how Republican Rep. Patrick Penn joked — from the House floor — about shooting former Democratic Rep. Jason Probst in a conversation with freshman legislator Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson. 
I guess conscience comes and goes. 
Probst shared a story on his Substack blog about a racist joke told among a gaggle of Republican representatives. According to Probst, the members enjoyed the following: “What’s the most confusing holiday in Ferguson, Missouri?” 
Answer: “Father’s Day.” 
For the record, a 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found Black fathers were more involved in their children’s lives than white or Hispanic fathers. 
Probst added in the blog: “They (conservative leadership) actively legislate to silence any dissenting voice. They use the levers of the system they control to enforce compliance. They punish those who refuse to be controlled by the rules.” 
 This is why they wanted to break Carr’s will. 
I felt it in my spirit. I know they try to kill it …
That two-faced sh– finished. Don’t push me to my limit. 
 And that’s the game so many people have faced at work. 
And I’m trying my best, my best to keep from going under
And it’s hard to forget
All the rain when we keep hearing the thunder 
I can remember a nugget of weather wisdom I received from a security guard at my first job. As we locked up and stepped out into a cloudy March night, we could hear thunder grumbling in the distance. 
“That means spring is near,” he said, pointing into the sky. 
Maybe. 
Spring symbolizes renewal and rebirth. Even resurrection for some. A new reality. 
But for many of us, we only get rain. 
The thunder hovers like shadows, and our springtime never arrives.

The billionaire owners of the Browns pulled a doozy on Ohio lawmakers to get the state to pony up a ton of public money for a domed stadium and glitzy development that nobody but Jimmy and Dee Haslam want. 
A slick presentation and some up-front cash — if rosy revenue projections flatline — did the trick. All the Haslams had to do to win a $600 million handout in the budget bill, passed last week by Ohio House Republicans, was convince the supermajority to trust them about making good on taxpayer stadium subsidies.   
Funny how Donald Trump’s henchmen used the same “trust me” pitch to urge shellshocked Americans to just accept that the president knows what he’s doing when he tanks the economy, wipes out trillions in retirement funds, and launches an incoherent trade war with the world. But I digress. 
The Haslams have their own angle to exploit with pliable state legislators, if not the public. They laid the groundwork for over half a billion in state subsidies for their private enterprise with generous campaign checks to Statehouse Republicans and healthy donations to party priorities — like $100,000 to defeat the anti-gerrymandering initiative last fall.
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

So, when the Browns lobbied the political beneficiaries of Haslam largesse in Columbus, the die was cast for a publicly subsidized covered stadium complex that could easily be paid for with private dollars. 
If the Ohio Senate concurs on the Haslam money ask — a terrible use of finite government resources — the state is poised to pay out $600 million in state-issued bonds for a second Browns stadium in Cuyahoga County based on little more than a promise of tangible economic benefits in return.
That’s nuts. The news is replete with examples of government-subsidized boondoggles never generating the benefits taxpayers were promised. (Still waiting on the Intel miracle to materialize.)
 But the list of sports teams promising the moon in new tax revenue, jobs and businesses in sketchy cost-benefit projections and falling short — is long. Before Ohio commits to financing the Haslam’s stadium and real estate venture with 30 years of bond payments that will, with interest, cost about a billion in forgone public services, taxpayers deserve some due diligence on the Browns money-making claims.
That was not done to any degree warranted in the Ohio House before a swift party-line vote forced taxpayers to foot the bill for a massive stadium project purely to appease wealthy team owners who greased GOP chiefs for government windfalls.
 It’s all about money and power. Forget tangible return on taxpayer investment. There’s a mountain of empirical studies on why publicly funded stadiums are a bad idea. It’s political malpractice by elected representatives. But House Republicans are stubbornly blind to raw facts when it comes to rationalizing corporate welfare at taxpayer expense. 
Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart was practically giddy about giving hundreds of millions in state subsidies (on top of other public contributions for infrastructure improvements to tax abatements) to help the owners of the Browns build their latest plaything. 
  State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville.(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)
“We’re going to have multiple Super Bowls played in the stadium,” he gushed about the brand-new home of a record-losing team — the Browns went 3-14 last season. “This is going to be a destination center!” 
Because the Haslams say so, Stewart?
Never mind the economic devastation on downtown Cleveland when the Haslams leave the lakefront for suburban Brook Park, a move that will create its own costly infrastructure nightmare for heavy airport traffic. 
Never mind that Cuyahoga County and Cleveland leaders remain adamant that the Browns’ “scheme” to relocate out of the city is a “betrayal to Ohio taxpayers” who paid for the stadium and bought the promises of their home team. 
Never mind that there is ongoing litigation to keep the Browns in Cleveland and firm opposition by Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne to any local funding for the Browns’ Brook Park stadium proposal. He called the Haslams $3.4 billion plan in the southwest suburb a “risky bet with public dollars” the county should not take and advocated, instead, for renovating the existing Browns stadium on the lakefront. 
“Having the stadium down there seems to be in everybody’s best interest,” said Jimmy Haslam in 2023, “so we’re committed to redoing the stadium.” 
Now he’s hitting up state and local governments for big bucks to underwrite what’s in his best interest; an extravagant and expensive gamble on a tract of land in Brook Park near the congested intersection of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. But it’s taxpayers who will eat the loss of public funds if Haslam’s crapshoot is a bust. 
Yet rather than slow down deliberations on the Browns’ wager and take a closer look at a huge public expenditure beset with more questions than answers, Ohio House Republicans rushed to indulge a prominent campaign donor with deep pockets. 
They stuffed their sweetheart bond deal for the Haslams into a budget bill that slashed public school funding, clawed back money from fiscally responsible districts, cut library funds, Medicaid expansion, even programs that target Ohio’s still high infant mortality rate and fund pediatric cancer research. How not to make Ohio great again.
But $600 million in taxpayer subsidies to play fantasy football with billionaires in exchange for government debt with little to no positive economic impact? “A once-in-a-lifetime” project, cooed Stewart. What a con.

Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
 ‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
 Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

Nelson.","Protestors outside the U.S. District Court of Maryland in Greenbelt rally in support of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father who was deported to El Salvador in an ""administrative error,” calling for him to be returned to the U.S. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The 14th Amendment of the Constitution bestowed a new covenant of law and order to the several states, citizens and residents of the United States. While born or naturalized citizens are entitled to certain rights and privileges that noncitizens are not, namely franchise and eligibility for public office, Section 1 of the amendment makes abundantly clear that any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is entitled to equal protection of, and due process under, her laws.
Neither the federal government nor the states may hold any person subject to their jurisdiction to a lower standard of legal protection or override the legal process — this condition does not move with the tide of political ideology in Washington, and its application ought not to change with popular sentiment toward immigration.
These constitutional realities, nonetheless, clash with the prerogative of the Trump White House. Within 1o0 days, enabled through Congress via the Laken Riley Act, the due process and equal protection clauses have been overridden. The consequences have been gravely concerning, with one Maryland family being ripped apart in a gross display of administrative incompetence.
Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was recently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and subsequently deported to the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador. He is a resident of Prince George’s County and has a wife and three young children who are all U.S. citizens. He fled El Salvador due to gang activity targeting his business, and a U.S. judge granted Temporary Protected Status on the basis that he would likely be targeted and harmed by gang violence were he to return to his home country.

The administration has conceded that he was incorrectly detained based on an “administrative error,” with Robert Cerna, the acting field office director for enforcement and removal operations for ICE saying so in a sworn statement. Despite this, the administration argues that Abrego Garcia cannot be retrieved because he is now under Salvadorean jurisdiction.
The U.S. District Court for Maryland ordered Abrego Garcia returned no later than 11:59 p.m. on April 7, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that order. The Supreme Court paused the district court order briefly, but on April 10 it sent the case back to the lower court, directing the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return and “ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”
Instead, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security doubled down on their assertion that Abrego Garcia is affiliated with the gang MS-13. Tricia McLaughin, DHS spokesperson, stated without evidence in a Fox News interview that he is involved in human trafficking, and in a later interview with National Public Radio cited an unnamed immigration judge who allegedly determined his affiliation with MS-13. When pressed to provide evidence for her claims, McLaughin said the information was “law enforcement sensitive” and its release would undermine national security.
In a clear-cut example of Orwellian doublespeak, McLaughlin told NPR on April 7 that due process is being applied to each case of deportation, but that it looks different for “terrorists”:  “In every single case, there is due process. When you’re looking at members of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua and other terrorist organizations that were designated as terrorist organizations under President Trump and the Trump administration, due process does look different because you’re under terrorist authority. So it’s going to be more law enforcement sensitive, but I can guarantee, and our DOJ guarantees, due process to these individuals.”
She asserts that due process is adhered to, then proceeds to rationalize a lack of due process on the basis of a national security threat that has not been demonstrated or proven. If this statement was not in direct contradiction to DHS’s own admission of error, perhaps it would be more convincing.
The complete lack of evidence presented, along with her antagonistic response to the fact that Abrego Garcia is a Maryland father, demonstrates the truth of the matter: the Trump administration is mandating Homeland Security to override the constitutional rule of law, and is prepared to defend the illegal detention and deportation of an innocent man to a foreign prison rife with human rights abuses.
During Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s visit to the White House on Monday, both hez and Trump resolved that they do not intend to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States, defying the 9-0 Supreme Court verdict and teeing up a constitutional crisis.
If this can happen to one Maryland family, the fabric of communities across the state is now jeopardized. This disruption to law and order ought to spark a sense of urgency in Maryland lawmakers to defend their oath to the laws of the United States, advocate for Marylanders and protect their communities even, and especially, when the federal government cannot be relied upon to do so.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/marylandprotesters-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:00:35.913684

Travis Holdman, R-Markle, presents his tax bill before the Senate on Jan. 28, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Shortly after midnight Tuesday, Indiana Senate Republicans agreed to significant changes in an immense local property and income tax plan — avoiding risky negotiations in favor of sending it to Gov. Mike Braun.
Despite earlier reservations — and a pressure campaign to veto — the governor appeared resolute immediately following the Senate vote.
“This is historic property tax relief. Senate Bill 1 cuts property taxes for most Hoosier homeowners, farmers, and businesses, limits future tax hikes, and makes the tax system fairer, more transparent, and easier to understand,” Braun said in a statement. “Real property tax relief was a core promise of my Freedom and Opportunity Agenda and with the collaborative leadership of our legislators, we are delivering real savings and protections for taxpayers. I look forward to signing the bill as soon as I receive it.”
The 27-22 tally came well ahead of an end-of-month deadline and followed a marathon day in the Senate chamber. Twelve Republicans joined Democrats in opposition: Sens. Ron Alting, Eric Bassler, Vaneta Becker, Mike Bohacek, Jim Buck, Cyndi Carrasco, Spencer Deery, Dan Dernulc, Aaron Freeman, Jim Tomes, Mike Young and Andy Zay
None of those senators spoke on the bill.
Senate Bill 1 would save homeowners a collective $1.2 billion in property taxes over three calendar years, from 2026 through 2028, according to a Thursday fiscal analysis. It does so largely by creating a credit for 10% off every homestead’s bill, up to $300 each.
  Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith addresses the property tax rally on March 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
That’s after House lawmakers on Wednesday made sweeping edits featuring the governor’s blessing and Senate input. It’s a far cry from Braun’s original plan.
Democrats discussed lost revenue for schools and communities that will force either local income tax hikes or severe service cuts.
Local units of government would lose a projected $1.5 billion over the three years, per the fiscal analysis. Public school corporations alone represent about half the anticipated loss, at $744 million — although Democrats contend other tax changes push that figure to almost $800 million.
“We’ve heard relief, relief, relief,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, Indianapolis. “But the efforts that we have in Senate Bill 1 are complex, and I don’t feel like they go far enough, and I do think that they create winners and losers.”
But Republicans noted revenue still goes up for most units — just not as much as under current law.
For instance, the city of Fort Wayne would see its property tax revenue rise from $167 million in 2025 to $201 million in 2028 if no changes are made. Under Senate Bill 1, the city will see revenue rise from $167 million to $187 million in 2028.
” I want to make sure we know it’s not loss, it’s unrealized potential gain,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville.
Still, Democrats weren’t the only ones unhappy with the deal.
“NOBODY understands this thing … including me!” Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, Braun’s second-in-command, posted Saturday. “On that basis alone we can’t let this become law. The Gov needs to VETO this thing, call a special session and demand the legislature pass something that the average Hoosier can understand without hiring army of lawyers and accountants!!”
Debate focuses on local income taxes 
Senators started debate on the bill at 10:35 p.m. A vote followed nearly two hours later at 12:18 a.m. Tuesday.
During the discourse, bill author Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, emphasized that Indiana’s property taxes “are very complicated” — and that “it’s taken the legislature 50 years to make it as complicated as we possibly could” — but under this bill, two-thirds of homeowners will receive a lower bill in 2026 compared to 2025.
The legislation caps total local income tax rates for all counties to 2.9%, down from 3.75%. Municipalities would be authorized to impose rates up to 1.2% within that county total — a tool they have not had before. Under current law, they have to get county officials on board to nab a local income tax.
Indianapolis Democrat Sen. Greg Taylor said Hoosier taxpayers were promised relief on property tax bills, “but I guess we didn’t add the comma and say, ‘But you really end up paying more on your income tax.'” He worried that locals will be forced to cut essential services if they resist income tax hikes.
Indiana House Republicans OK massive local property, income tax plan that Democrats dub a ‘scam’

“When your city council comes to you and says, ‘What do you want us to do? Cut services or increase (local income taxes)?’… we’re going to say, ‘Well, we gave you an option,'” Taylor said.
“We know what the option is going to be. We’re going to cut services. You mark my words. You’re going to cut services,” he continued. “You think we’ve got road problems? You think we’ve got access to government service problems? Just wait.”
Holdman held that while higher local income taxes “may be the case in some situations,” raising those taxes remains optional.
Instead, he preferred for local governments to become “more efficient” before raising taxes.
“I think there are expenses that cities and towns and county governments have that they could trim their budgets,” Holdman added. “I think there needs to be a review of all expenditures at a local level to make sure that they’re spending their dollars wisely.”
Also under the bill, fixed-income seniors would get an additional $150 discount off their property tax bills stacked atop the $300 maximum available to the general population. Disabled veterans could also qualify for stackable credits of $150 and $250.
In exchange, lawmakers nixed assessed-value-based deductions for those populations.
Renters ‘left out’
Over three years, the bill would cut property taxes by about $25 million for apartments, almost $69 million for other residential properties, $116 million on farmland and $145 million on personal property. But bills for agricultural business and other real properties would rise by $63 million and $720 million, respectively.
That adds up to about $802 million in savings across other property types.
The overhauled legislation additionally phases in a major increase in the acquisition cost threshold for the business personal property tax exemption — from $80,000 to $2 million — and narrows application of the 30% depreciation floor. It previously would’ve phased the tax itself out by 2030 on anything purchased this year or later.
Still, Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, questioned why the bill does not directly address — or provide relief for — the 560,000 tenants across the state.
Holdman held that his measure deals with property taxes, which “tenants do not pay.”

Qaddoura disagreed.
“Tenants do pay property tax,” he said. “When you live in an apartment building or in a house, the landlord will pass all of these costs, including property taxes.”
Hunley further took issue with the inclusion of Senate Bill 518, a measure to require traditional schools to share property taxes with charters. Another provision dissolve the Union School Corporation.
“I think that we do need to talk about process and procedure, and the fact that this is the way that we’re going to do business from now on — that we can just simply amend into a piece of legislation the closure of an entire school district,” she said. “And that we can do that without regard for public hearing or process, and that we can just redraw new maps and new boundary lines for an entire school corporation, for families, for a whole community from up here on high in Marion County, and determine what’s best without true regard for collaboration with the community.”
Before the vote, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, reiterated that the legislation “is too big,” and that lawmakers “have forced too much into one bill.”
“As you shuffle the burden of taxes, there may be some that gets pushed to businesses. … but ultimately, we’re doing so at the expense of already struggling schools, struggling communities, renters and others that need us most,” he said. “There are multiple poison pills throughout this thing. And ultimately, school districts and local communities will have to make the toughest decisions that they’ve ever had to, at a time where things are just uncertain.”

This decision may seem like a minor regulatory choice, but its consequences will ripple across the state, affecting consumers, medical patients, businesses, and even Connecticut’s tax revenue.
Here’s what’s at stake:
• Limited consumer choice – The cap ensures that adult-use cannabis remains restricted to lower-potency products, leaving many consumers without the options they seek.
• A shrinking market – High-potency products are in demand, but many producers won’t bother navigating Connecticut’s strict regulations, opting out instead.
• Medical patients abandoned – Those who rely on higher-potency cannabis for pain management, PTSD, or other medical conditions will continue to struggle, despite statutory protections.
• A blow to local businesses – Consumers who can’t find what they need in licensed dispensaries will turn to unregulated markets, hurting Connecticut’s legal cannabis industry.
• Lost tax revenue – When people buy outside the system, the state and municipalities miss out on millions in tax dollars that could support infrastructure, public health, and community reinvestment.
The reality is simple: High-potency cannabis will exist whether lawmakers acknowledge it or not. The real question is whether these products will be sold safely in a regulated market or drive consumers into unregulated, potentially dangerous alternatives. Connecticut has an opportunity to strengthen its legal cannabis industry while protecting public health. By refusing to reconsider the THC cap, lawmakers are choosing prohibition-era thinking over practical policy—and everyone stands to lose because of it.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Musk’s reverse-Robin Hood playbook is not new. Electric Boat has used it for years,Colleen Shaddox,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/musks-reverse-robin-hood-playbook-is-not-new-electric-boat-has-used-it-for-years/,Do Connecticut taxpayers get our money’s worth for the millions we hand to Electric Boat? I found no evidence that we do – and I looked hard.,"U.S. Americans worry that public funds for essential services are being diverted to the obscenely rich. They fear that it’s happening in the dark, where we cannot witness, let alone fight, this thievery.
I’m scared too but not surprised, because I spent about a year of my life tracking the millions that General Dynamics Electric Boat gets from Connecticut taxpayers and how state law explicitly prohibits us from getting information about what public benefits (if any) result.  I faced down a table full of lawyers defending the privacy of this highly profitable corporation  (General Dynamics netted 3.8 billion last year) as I was denied answers about where my (and your) money went.
Elon Musk has nothing on Electric Boat.
Let me begin at the beginning: In 2018 Connecticut pledged $83 million in aid to Electric Boat, ostensibly so that EB would expand Groton operations, create jobs and purchase more from in-state vendors. As this five-year program was wrapping up,  the War Resisters League asked me to investigate whether EB created the economic benefits the state was promised.
The first step was obvious: EB had to report annually to the state Department of Economic and Community Development on payroll, in-state purchases and other information that would indicate whether it was acting as a stimulus to the  economy. I requested copies of those reports under the Freedom of Information Act. I received documents that were largely redacted (Picture a blacked-out letter from a Soviet gulag). I appealed to the state’s Freedom of Information Commission, where my request was opposed not only by the state but by Electric Boat. The commissioners seemed sympathetic – after all I was asking about the return on the investment of my tax dollars – but agreed with EB’s counsel that state law explicitly includes FOIA exemptions for businesses getting assistance from DECD.
To state the obvious: corporate welfare should not get its own special exemption from FOIA disclosure.
I did get some satisfaction from FOIA requests. I learned how many EB employees qualify for SNAP and Medicaid. Not a lot (316), but the common wisdom is that EB jobs are good jobs, period. People with good jobs don’t need food stamps. Now that Musk and company are dismantling the federal safety net, I doubt these workers will get raises to keep the cupboards full. I learned that EB contests property tax assessments, so its valuations to the towns where it resides, Groton, New London, and Norwich, are reduced by millions. That’s money made up by the average homeowner, or by landlords who pass expenses on to their tenants.
I started asking myself, “If EB is such a treasure, why isn’t New London more like Greenwich?” Don’t get me wrong: I’d rather hang out in New London, with its far superior music scene. But the poverty rate is 20 percent in New London, with racial disparities that make it much higher in some communities. Furthermore, EB’s presence may be raising housing costs. One bedroom apartment rents rose 37% in New London from pre-pandemic 2020 to 2023 – the biggest jump in the state.
Imagine the state spent the $83 million it handed to EB on the region’s schools, microloans for small businesses, green conversions, and so on? Seems like a better strategy to fight poverty.
Is EB really the best investment Connecticut can make? I’ve been unable to get the data necessary to answer that question. I suspect that had the answer been “yes,”  the governor and EB’s CEO would have held a joint press conference to trumpet the numbers that I was denied.
About now, some readers are probably saying, “She was working for the War Resisters League. She’s some peacenik.” Guilty as charged.
But I set out to answer a financial question, not a moral one: “Do Connecticut taxpayers get our money’s worth for the millions we hand to Electric Boat?” I found no evidence that we do – and I looked hard.
People have different visions of what they want from government. That’s why we have elections. But no one that I know thinks government exists to take money away from the poor and middle class and jam it into the pockets of the rich. I don’t know why we tolerate it on the state or the federal level.
Joanne Sheehan of the War Resisters League and I will lead a discussion about the EB report at All Souls Unitarian Universal Community Room, 19 Jay St., New London, at 5:30 p.m., Thursday, April 17.
Please consider joining us. We still have some semblance of democracy. We should use it.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Disgusted with the CT Secretary of the State,Lisa Amatruda,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/registrar-disgusted-with-ct-sec-of-state/,A Woodbury Republican Registrar of Voters says she was appalled at Stephanie Thomas's partisan and insulting rhetoric.,"This past week, the Registrar of Voters Association of Connecticut (ROVAC) held its semi-annual conference. While Registrars of Voters (ROVs) are nominated and elected based on political party affiliation —each town and city in Connecticut must have one Republican and one Democrat Registrar— the core mission of our job transcends politics. 
When we walk into our offices to oversee the integrity of elections and maintain accurate voter rolls, we leave our political affiliations at the door. This nonpartisan approach is essential to ensuring that every voter, regardless of their background or beliefs, is treated professionally, fairly, and equally. Every citizen needs to feel confident that no matter who assists them in a registrar’s office, they will be treated with respect and impartiality.
ROVAC hosts two major training events each year: a three-day Spring conference and a two-day Fall session. These events provide critical education on election laws, policies, and best practices for maintaining accurate voter registration records. Each event also includes guest speakers, who share insights and expertise on various election-related topics. On Wednesday, April 10, Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas was invited as the guest speaker.
However, what followed was a stark departure from the spirit of professionalism that is expected at ROVAC events. Secretary Thomas began her speech by claiming that she is not a political or partisan person. Yet, her speech quickly devolved into one of the most divisive, political, and vitriolic tirades I have ever witnessed. 
Half the room consisted of Republican Registrars of Voters, and the tone and content of her address felt completely out of place. Secretary Thomas repeatedly criticized President Trump and his administration, spewing misinformation about his Executive Order on “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” She espoused partisan talking points, claiming that under this administration, women and people of color would be disenfranchised. I found it deeply insulting and classless that she suggested women and people of color somehow don’t know how to obtain a driver’s license or an official ID.
The situation escalated when Secretary Thomas referred to President Trump —and by extension, half the room— using the term “SS,” implying that we were akin to Nazis. This was the moment I got up and left the room. The venomous language and partisan rhetoric made it impossible to continue listening.
What is Secretary Thomas so afraid of? In Connecticut, we’ve seen instances like the Bridgeport ballot stuffing scandal, caught on camera, which demonstrate that our elections are far from flawless. 
Registrars of Voters in Connecticut are prohibited from asking for proof of citizenship when registering voters. Why, then, does Secretary Thomas oppose efforts to ensure that our elections are free from fraud and error, and unmarred by suspicion? These are fundamental concerns that transcend partisan politics and go to the heart of maintaining the integrity of our electoral system.
As the Executive Order on election integrity states, “The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election.” This is not a partisan issue. It is a fundamental concern for all Americans that only U.S. citizens vote in our elections.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut families need earned wage access,Kerri M. Raissian,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/connecticut-families-need-earned-wage-access/,The General Assembly should pass SB 1396 allowing Earned Wage Access to meet Connecticut workers’ real-world needs.,"In January 2024, Connecticut made legislative changes that effectively shut down the ability of many workers to obtain instant transfers of their own earned wages between pay periods. However, my new study with colleagues finds that the Connecticut General Assembly should reverse this and pass SB 1396 this session. Doing so would give Connecticut workers faster access to their earned wages and help them make ends meet.
Prior to 2024, Connecticut residents were able to instantly access their earned wages through an electronic transfer via Earned Wage Access (EWA).  EWA is a service that allows workers to access the income they have already earned but not yet received. To be clear, this is not a loan or a salary advance but providing someone the portion of a paycheck they have already earned, prior to payday. 


In order to get instant access, workers had to pay a $3.49 instant transfer fee (much like Venmo).  On January 1, 2024, Connecticut eliminated the instant transfer fee option, which, by removing the mechanism that allowed EWA service providers to cover their costs, effectively eliminated EWA in Connecticut.
As a researcher and Associate Professor of Public Policy at the University of Connecticut, much of my work —centered around using economic data to understand society’s problems— is ultimately about understanding how policy changes impact families. Colleagues and I wanted to know how this seemingly small, innocuous even, policy might affect people’s lives (the study was commissioned by DailyPay, an EWA provider, but conducted independently of them). To determine the effect of the instant transfer elimination, we surveyed 508 Connecticut-based EWA users and asked them a series of questions about their lives and finances, and if, and to what extent, they noticed any impact of the January 2024 EWA changes.

Kerri Raissian PhD
Of our 508 respondents, 65% were female, the majority were non-white, and 77% reported living with children in their homes. Although most of our sample indicated that they had been employed during the last seven days before our survey, 61% also reported an annual household income of less than $75,000. Most of our survey respondents reported not having access to savings, a budgeting plan, or the ability to cover unexpected expenses. In other words, these EWA users are Connecticut workers who live paycheck to paycheck.
Importantly, when EWA users access their earned wages, it was for urgent, time sensitive needs: the main reasons were food and groceries (91%), transportation including gas (66%), rent or mortgage (55%), and utility bills (60%) (see Figure 1 below, modified from the report). 


It seems appropriate that a user would need their wages immediately rather than in a few days’ time.  Given this, the instant transfer is an integral part to allowing EWA to provide financial relief to their family. 
In addition to asking users how they relied on EWA, we asked them about their financial circumstances in the past 12 months. Many of them had fallen behind on bills (65%), overdrew their bank accounts (28%), paid bills late (25%), paid credit cards late (25%), among other negative financial outcomes (see Figure 2 below, replicated from the report).


I see several financial hardships pressing on Connecticut’s families: higher cost of living, higher cost of credit, economic uncertainty, to name a few.  Those in our survey reported accessing their wages to purchase food and groceries, cover transportation costs, and pay for rent, mortgages, or utilities. Soon, the school year will end, making it harder for families to access social services and school meals to keep their children properly cared for and nourished. Without the services provided throughout the school year, reinstating the EWA instant transfer option could be especially welcome to Connecticut’s families this summer.
To be sure, the legislature’s 2024 decision to cut EWA in Connecticut was almost certainly designed to protect workers from predatory practices and tools that could take advantage of their financial limitations and needs. Even if it was well-meaning, however, it has had unintended consequences for employees and their families. Since the EWA change, too many Connecticut users say they have fallen behind on bills, overdrafted accounts, paid bills late, taken out a money order, or taken out a payday loan. Others have even had to go without meeting basic needs.
There are no perfect options for Connecticut’s residents whose salaries are too low and who face a cost of living that is too high. But by removing EWA, the state has seemingly moved them closer to things we’d all like to avoid: going into debt, relying upon the kindness of friends and family, or going without something they need for themselves and their children. Moreover, the $3.49 transfer fee is roughly equivalent to an ATM fee; it is likely less expensive and more transparent than cumulative credit card debt, overdraft fees, or loan interest; and it provides dignity to Connecticut’s families.
Finally, the users in our study said they thought the EWA tool was useful and fair. Our study shows that eliminating it is no solution for working families.
That is why the Connecticut legislature’s Banking Committee is seeking to revive EWA this year. I commend them for unanimously voting it out of the Banking Committee. I urge the Connecticut General Assembly to pass SB 1396 and allow Earned Wage Access to meet Connecticut workers’ real-world needs.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to Nampa with a message about fighting back against policies that benefit the wealthiest at the expense of working class Americans, but the comments about health care from every speaker seemed to resonate the most with those in attendance.
Sanders, an Independent U.S. senator from Vermont and former presidential candidate, has been touring various cities nationwide under the title “Fighting Oligarchy,” often with Ocasio-Cortez as a guest speaker. The night before, the pair spoke to a crowd of 20,000 to the south in Salt Lake City and the crowd in Nampa on Monday night reached the Ford Idaho Center’s full capacity of 12,500, according to Andrew Luther, the general manager of the arena.
Sanders said they chose to come to Idaho even though it is deeply conservative — President Donald Trump won the state by 36 points in November — because “we don’t accept this blue state, red state nonsense. We are one people.”
He railed against Elon Musk, the leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, who is the wealthiest man in the world and gave Trump’s presidential campaign $270 million. Ocasio-Cortez also spoke against members of Congress trading stocks, accusing several of insider trading, and both spoke about the need for universal health care.
“We’re here to flip this state,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We might all come from different places, but we share so many of the same experiences.”

 Idaho doctor talks physician shortage, state’s near-total abortion ban

Before the politicians took the stage, local family physician Dr. Penny Beach spoke about health care in Idaho, where the number of physicians per capita is the lowest in the country and a near-total abortion ban has further exacerbated that shortage, leading some OB-GYNs and half of the state’s maternal-fetal medicine specialists to leave the state and practice elsewhere. 
Idaho’s abortion law also came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024, when state officials argued that emergency room physicians should not be permitted to perform an abortion in emergency situations as mandated by federal law.
“We have created laws that criminalize health care providers and have led to almost 25% fewer OB-GYNs practicing in this state,” Beach said in her remarks. “We’ve seen labor and delivery units shut down. We’ve seen several attempts to repeal Medicaid expansion despite overwhelming public support. … It’s wrong, and we’re here to say, ‘Enough.’”
Beach told States Newsroom the shortage of OB-GYNs has led at least one large reproductive health clinic in the Boise area to stop accepting Medicaid patients altogether because the staffing difficulties have created financial strain. Nationwide, about 40% of births are covered by Medicaid. Beach said that’s why she supports Sanders’ message about providing health care for all Americans.
“We need to treat health care as a human right, not a luxury,” she said.
 Idahoans share different reasons for attending Nampa rally

Marissa Locati, one of the attendees, said she went to the rally because she wants a better future for her 11-month-old son, particularly with his future education in mind. 
The new mom and lifelong Idahoan said she’s also worried about reproductive rights. 
“I want to make sure that I am protected,” she said. “I want to be able to have the family I want and the size that I want. If any health concern pops up, I want to make sure that I can take care of it. That my health care is just as important as my husband’s or my son’s.”
Another attendee, Dylan Neubauer, said he doesn’t quite fit with either political party. The College of Western Idaho student moved to Nampa from a more Democratic state because he was attracted to the state’s socially conservative policies, such as promoting gun rights and anti-LGBTQ+ policies. 
But Neubauer said he also believes in union rights, fighting against corporations, and said he thinks Trump has gone too far with his immigration policy and women should be the ones making abortion policy decisions.
“We’re losing our rights every moment of the day, and nobody’s doing anything about it,” said Karing Nial, a Boise resident who attended the event. “I am so disappointed in our elected officials. I’m so disappointed in Congress. I want them to stand up and do the right thing, and no one is doing it, so the people have to.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The federal government has revoked the visas of four international students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, without explanation or prior notice to students or the university, university officials said on Monday. 
“This week, we learned that the federal government has revoked visas for four individuals affiliated with UAA — one current student and three recent graduates in post-graduation training — without prior notice,” said UA President Pat Pitney in a university wide email on Monday.  
No students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks or University of Alaska Southeast have been affected to date, Pitney said. She said university staff are monitoring immigration records daily, and working to support students. She urged affected students to contact international student services offices of their campus for support.
“These immigration issues do not impact a student’s academic standing at UA,” Pitney added. “Our international students and scholars are vital members of our community, and we remain fully committed to supporting their success.” 
The federal government did not provide the student or university a specific reason for the visa cancelations, according to Jonathon Taylor, university director of public affairs. 
When asked if any of the students were detained by the Alaska Department of Corrections, a spokesperson said they were not able to immediately respond by Monday afternoon. 
Students can generally stay in the U.S. but can no longer leave and re-enter without applying for another visa. 
If there are changes to a student’s immigration status, then the government is required to provide a reason, said Nicholas Olano, an Anchorage-based immigration attorney with Nations Law Group. 
“The question is, are the regulations being followed here? And that is what needs to be looked at carefully. Are these people giving proper notice?” he said.
Olano said usually an individual must be convicted of a crime for immigration status to be affected, but under the Trump administration it can be for simply an arrest, or allegations of misconduct. “What is happening now is by all means extreme,” he said. 
Over 1,000 international students have had visas revoked at over 180 colleges and universities, according to a national tracking project by Inside Higher Ed, a news site. Several students have filed lawsuits arguing the government has failed to justify canceling visas or terminating immigration status, and denied them due process.
Many cases are related to protests or statements in connection with the Israel-Hamas war.
An executive order Trump issued early in his term cited “an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism and violence,” and called on the government to use “all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.” Last week, the Trump administration announced it would screen immigrants’ social media for what it termed “antisemitism.”
However, students and advocates nationally have said many students are targeted for their involvement in peaceful protests to support Palestinians affected by the ongoing war, and the Trump administration’s actions target First Amendment protected rights to freedom of speech. 
Olano said it’s a “huge difference” between participating in a protest and a criminal infraction leading to a notice to appear before an immigration judge and be placed in deportation proceedings, but he advised students to take extra caution.
“It’s horrible; I’m having to say this because I think that the First Amendment, the Constitution, covers every single individual that is in the United States presently,” he said. “But at this moment, you should not exercise your right to free speech because you can have consequences. That’s the most un-American thing ever. But I’m saying it.”
Olano advised students to contact an immigration attorney, adding that legal resources and information are available by contacting the ACLU of Alaska. 
In addition to the effect on international students, Olano expressed concern for the state’s economy and future.
“This is going to hurt Alaska in the long run,” he said. “In the short term, too. We’re going to see less students that bring money from their countries to spend here at the universities. Because international students pay significantly higher tuition fees than the local students, and those monies are going to stop coming in. We are going to lose prospective employees for companies. And with all that is going on, Alaska is going to be hurting even more for people.”

If the governor vetoes the bill, lawmakers must meet “immediately” in joint session to vote and either confirm the governor’s veto or override it.
Overriding a veto on HB 69 would require 40 of the Legislature’s 60 members. Lawmakers for and against HB 69 have said they doubt there are enough votes to override a Dunleavy veto on the issue. 
And even if the bill became law, actually funding the formula would require action in a separate budget appropriation bill. Overriding a budget veto would require 45 of 60 legislators.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard) Washington House lawmakers, for nearly five hours on Monday, battled through the latest round of debate in the state Legislature over parental rights. 
Democrats say the bill they approved is needed to clarify parts of a citizen initiative that the Legislature passed last year and to align it with other state and federal laws. Republicans frame the effort as a strategy to gut the earlier measure, which lays out certain rights for the parents of public school students.
The bill passed on a party-line vote, 56-39. Democrats at one point invoked a rule to halt debate on amendments, which sped up proceedings but also blocked Republicans from voicing concerns.  
“Not every child in this state or in this country has the benefit of parents who are loving, who are supportive, who are there for them,” said Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, D-Seattle, who chairs the House Education Committee. 
Republicans slammed the bill, at times characterizing it as one of the worst Democrats have put forward this year. 
“This bill is creating a wedge, putting a wedge between parents and their children,” said Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco. “I feel like the schools should not operate under the premise that the parents are bad or dangerous, that type of premise, again, creates that wedge.” 
House approval moves the legislation closer to becoming state law, but because the bill was amended, it must go back to the Senate before it can potentially head to the governor’s desk.
Initiative 2081 was a citizen initiative that more than 400,000 residents signed onto and that was approved in last year’s legislative session. It declared 15 specific rights for the parents and guardians of public school children under the age of 18. 
Two bills linked to the initiative are currently in play —  Senate Bill 5181, which the House approved on Monday and House Bill 1296, which was overhauled last month to deal largely with the rights of students. The Senate approved House Bill 1296 on Friday.
Some of the biggest changes Senate Bill 5181 would make to the law passed last year are around parents’ access to their children’s medical records, including for mental health counseling.
It would remove the rights of parents to receive prior notification when medical services are being offered to their child, except where emergency medical treatment is required. The same goes for notifications about when a school has arranged directly or indirectly for medical treatment that results in follow-up care outside normal school hours.
Democrats say some of those rights are still included in other state and federal laws but students do have privacy rights when it comes to their health care. For example, a 1985 law gives children 13 years or older the right to mental health treatment without parental consent. 
The bill also removes language from the existing parental rights law that would make medical and mental health records available to a child’s parents. But here again, Democratic lawmakers have suggested that parents should still have access to these types of records under other state laws.
“The medical records that are being referenced are not created in school environments,” said Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver. “Educational records are educational records and are governed by public school policy. Health care records are health care records. Those are not created by school personnel.” 
Similar to the law approved last year, the bill calls for “immediate notification” of parents if there’s an allegation of a crime committed against their child, or if their child is interrogated by police. It also adds other notifications, including when a child has been detained for involvement in criminal activity or if a school shooting occurs.
The bill specifies that schools don’t have to release records to parents who are under investigation for, or charged with, child abuse or neglect.  
During Monday’s floor action, Republicans introduced 15 amendments, of which two were adopted. 
These included ones calling for parents to receive a copy of a child’s public school records within 10 business days, instead of 45 days, and to publish a notice that identifies medical services made available to students without prior consent of a parent or legal guardian.  
Republicans blasted Democrats for cutting off debate. Earlier in the session, Democrats changed the House rules so they could do this with the support of a simple majority rather than two-thirds of members.
“We knew this day might come, but to see it unfold during the Parental Rights initiative — backed by nearly half a million voters — is a disgrace, ” Republican Deputy Minority Leader Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, said in a statement.
Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, said the bill “led to the censorship of representatives of the people of Washington state who strongly supported the initiative.” 
Rejected amendments included ones calling for parents to get prior notification when medical services are being offered to their child, to receive medical records, including for mental health counseling, for children under 12, and to remove the emergency clause that would allow the bill to take effect immediately and prevent it from facing a potential voter referendum. 
Republicans also proposed an amendment to block transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. 
“This amendment relies on two erroneous premises, the first that trans girls are not girls, not true, and the second, that boys are inherently better athletes than girls, not true,” said Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, before Democrats rejected the amendment. 
GOP lawmakers also sought to prohibit pornographic images from instructional materials, but Democrats said certain images may be needed to teach science and health curriculum and voted this down, too.
When the Legislature passed the initiative last year, Democrats said that they would revisit the law if it created confusion.
“That’s exactly what we’re doing, is coming back to provide the clarity that we said needed to be done in order to make sure that the bill that we pass aligns with our current state law,” said Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Auburn, the sponsor of the Senate bill on students’ rights.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1255-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-15 00:01:30.121465

(John Cole/Capital-Star)Brent Copenhaver and his wife Stacey own Talview Dairy Farm, a dairy operation in Lebanon County, and sell most of their milk regionally in Pennsylvania.
To Brent, he thinks there is currently one big issue farmers across Pennsylvania are thinking about.
“I think tariffs definitely are on people’s mind,” Brent Copenhaver said to the Capital-Star. “How that will impact us locally is still, I think, yet to be determined.”
The Copenhavers hosted several high ranking government officials on Monday morning, including U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. She was joined by U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R), U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson – Chair of the House Agriculture Committee –and U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District).
They made the case the tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration will prove beneficial to farmers.

Since Trump made his tariff announcement on April 2, the stock market has experienced volatility, leading to concerns from economists about a potential recession.
Rollins said the effort was to create better trade deals with countries, who she claimed have been taking advantage of America for decades.
“That realignment is disruptive. It’s transformative, but is disruptive,” Rollins said. “And so we’re watching the market adjust to that right now. We believe it will be a short term adjustment.”
McCormick, who supports Trump’s tariff policy, said there has been “uncertainty” with the markets as of late, but he believes that the economy will benefit as new trade deals are ironed out.
During Trump’s first term, some $25 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was used to give direct payments to farmers impacted by trade disputes with China. Rollins said the administration is prepared to provide relief to farmers “if there is damaging consequences to these (trade) negotiations.”
“The hope and the goal is that it won’t be necessary,” Rollins said, but added the administration was prepared to help out farmers, if needed.
Thompson echoed Rollins, saying he was “fully supportive of Trump” on the issue of trade and that he doesn’t expect it will be needed for farmers, but is prepared to support those payments, if needed.
Thompson referenced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and China Phase One deal, during Trump’s administration as proof he trusts the president on resolving the ongoing tariff situation. 
Rollins says “money is there for food banks” 
In March, the USDA notified Pennsylvania and other states across the country that they were cancelling programs to provide $1 billion of federal funding to schools and food banks to allow them to purchase food from farms, according to Politico.
Following the move, Gov. Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Agriculture Sec. Russell Redding held a press conference on March 25 announcing they were pushing back on the USDA action to cancel $13 million over the next three years in funding for Pennsylvania farmers. Redding said he sent a letter to the federal agency to appeal the decision and Shapiro said if it fails, he would consider further legal action.
Rollins said she respects Shapiro, but added he or other leaders in Pennsylvania, “don’t have their facts right, or they’re playing games.”
“They’re trying to make this a political issue,” Rollins said to reporters at Martin’s Family Farm in Myerstown, Lebanon County. “The money is there.”
Rollins argued since becoming the head of the USDA, they’ve “released almost one billion dollars to food banks” and said there is money sitting in state accounts from the USDA to support food banks.

Thompson says no cuts will be made to SNAP
A budget plan from House Republicans would cut $230 billion from the Department of Agriculture, according to Reuters, and Democrats are concerned the cuts would come from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. It “provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget.
Thompson called it a “mistruth” and said that he is “not going to stand for any cuts” to the program.
“These are our neighbors that are living in difficult financial times,” Thompson said. He added that changes can be made to make the program more effective.
During a Q&A with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star in March, Thompson said there would be no reductions to SNAP in the next Farm Bill and would like to expand access to “two vulnerable populations who have never been eligible” for SNAP before: Those previously incarcerated for felony drug charges when they return from prison and “adult children of families that are living in financially challenging circumstances,” who “tend to be children with disabilities.”
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cited potential cuts to SNAP as reasons he’s opposed recent GOP budget plans.

“Labor is a massive concern” Rollins says
As the Trump administration follows through on its promise of deportations, the president suggested at a cabinet meeting on Thursday that farmers could petition to keep workers without legal status, Reuters reported. Rollins recognized the concern the administration has over the agriculture workforce on Monday.
“Labor continues to be a massive concern for our agriculture community,” Rollins said.
The secretary said she and U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer have been tasked with working with legislative partners to come up with solutions to the issue.
Thompson said in the previous session of Congress, he put together a bipartisan work group to address the challenges facing the agriculture workforce and “in the not too distant future” they will put together a “discussion draft” to get input on potential remedies.
“We need to do this in a tri-partisan way,” Thompson said, making the case that Democrats, Republicans, and the agriculture industry can work together on the matter.
In the past,Thompson said the H2-A visa program, which helps American farmers fill temporary employment gaps by hiring workers from other countries, needs to be reformed, including making it “year round.”

How’s the Farm Bill?
Thompson said that the Farm Bill, which is passed roughly every 5 years, is “coming along nicely.”
In 2024, Congress approved a one-year extension of the bill, as the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are on the clock to pass the next version of the legislation.
Will it pass this year?
“You bet,” Thompson said. “It absolutely should. The sooner in the year is the better, obviously.”
Thompson previously told the Capital-Star his goal was to “get this done in the first six months and as early as possible.”
With elected leaders and Secretary Rollins on hand, Brent Copenhaver said he was “honored” to host them and “promote the dairy industry.” He described updating the Farm Bill as important to local farmers as well and specifically wanting to see updated language for dairy margin coverage (DMC).
“Those numbers are based off your production history, and those numbers are outdated,” he said. “We have improved on how we have handled our cows. We have improved our milk production, and I think they need to go back and revisit and look at that production history and allow us to increase that production history to be on a more average of what we are doing today.”
“We just need to update some of the things. It’s already in the bill. We just need it updated,” Copenhaver added. “And it’s a great program that the USDA does offer.”

Brad Little leaves his office to give the State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, at the Idaho Statehouse. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Monday issued a line-item veto on a bill to retain the governor’s emergency fund.
House Bill 482, passed nearly unanimously by the Idaho Legislature, would have eliminated the balance of the governor’s emergency fund. 
In recent years, Little has used the emergency fund to support the investigation into the killings of four University of Idaho students, and for efforts to fight fentanyl and help secure the U.S.’s southern border with Mexico, the governor’s office said in a news release. 
Slightly more than $652,000 remains in the governor’s emergency fund, according to the bill’s fiscal note. 
“As leaders, we need the tools to be agile in responding to crises that affect our citizens. I line-item vetoed this budget bill because eliminating the Governor’s emergency fund only hinders our ability to respond quickly in a fast-moving situation,” Little wrote in a prepared statement. “I share the Legislature’s vigor for ensuring government is efficient, but citizens expect government to be responsive in times of crisis.”
The bill would have zeroed out the governor’s emergency fund by directing the State Controller’s Office to transfer all remaining balance in the fund to the state’s general fund “as soon as practicable” for Idaho’s current fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
Little’s line-item veto rejected that transfer, but approved the bill’s other fund transfers into law. 
The governor’s emergency fund transfer would have, according to the bill’s fiscal note, centralized “the state’s emergency funds in the Office of Emergency Management in the Military Division.”
In his veto letter, Little called it critical for the governor’s emergency fund to maintain the funds. The fund, he wrote, “has been used to address serious and unexpected situations that fall outside of a formally declared state of emergency.”
 Unclear if Idaho Legislature will reconvene to respond to line-item veto

It’s not immediately clear how the Idaho Legislature will respond to the governor’s line-item veto.
The Legislature adjourned for the year, officially called sine die, more than a week ago on April 4. During the legislative session, the Legislature can override gubernatorial vetoes with two-thirds support in the House and Senate.

With support from 60% of members, the Legislature can call itself back in for a special session. House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, doubted that would happen but said legislative leaders could see if there’s a desire for a special session, he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Monday.
But Moyle called the veto unusual, saying the governor could still access $31 million in emergency funds if he declared an emergency. The fund the bill would’ve zeroed out was created as a response to COVID-19, Moyle said. 
“He could declare an emergency and still send the officers to the border. He could declare an emergency and still help out up there …” Moyle said. “This wasn’t to reduce funding. Usually, a veto is to reduce funding. This is to increase funding in his own budget. This is not normal.”
Shanon Gray, an attorney for the family of homicide victim Kaylee Goncalves, provided a statement from the family in support of the governor’s line-item veto.
“We are in support of keeping the governor’s emergency fund,” the family wrote. “In a case like ours, where a terrible tragedy occurred in a small jurisdiction in Idaho the promise of a Governor who prioritizes justice over dollars was pivotal in our case. Using the emergency fund to allocate resources to Moscow in order for a proper investigation to be done was one of the most critical pieces in bringing the defendant to justice.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Mainers told U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree Monday night that she and other Democrats are not doing enough.  
A litany of questions at a town hall at Westbrook Performing Arts Center delivered a post-mortem of the 2024 election: Democrats have a messaging problem. Democrats lost young voters. Democrats don’t say things plainly. Constituents also delivered sharp criticism of what they view as insufficient action from Democrats to stop President Donald Trump from dismantling the separation of powers and disregarding the rule of law.   
Pingree agreed. “I take it all as valid criticism,” she said. 
The 1st District representative also told the crowd of more than 700 that she’s working on it. “I am in the fight every single day,” she vowed. 
Her constituents commended her for hosting the forum, noting the rest of Maine’s congressional delegation has not afforded such opportunities. Pingree also hosted a town hall in Camden on Sunday but before that, the last in-person town hall she did was in 2017, when Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Trump’s first term. Pingree also hosted a virtual town hall with state Attorney General Aaron Frey last month about the importance of state-level challenges to counter Trump.
But attendees ultimately told Pingree she needs to take more of a stand. 
“Why are Democrats not doing more to resist the Trump administration and putting on a united front?” asked Alex Wu, senior at Scarborough High School and founding member of the youth advocacy team of Democracy Maine, which focuses on making government more accessible. 
“I’ve seen you wear pink,” Wu said, referring to disjointed messaging with some Democratic congresswomen sporting the color during a speech last month to call attention to Trump’s actions negatively impacting women. “I want to see disruption.”

Wu and others also shared their desire for Pingree and other Democrats to deploy the strategies Republicans have used for decades, such as interrupting normal procedure. 
“What is the vision? What’s the mission? Where’s our Project 2027 or 2029?” another attendee asked, referring to Project 2025, the blueprint written by the conservative Heritage Foundation for reshaping the federal government, some of which has now been executed by the Trump administration.   
Mainers requested Pingree take a page out of Trump’s playbook, so-to-speak. Stop acting like politicians, they reiterated. 
Pingree did not go so far as to call Trump a Nazi who was sending people to concentration camps, as one attendee continuously requested before being escorted out by police for interrupting. However, Pingree did reiterate a statement she made earlier Monday on social media demanding the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant who was in the U.S. legally that the Trump administration sent to, as Pingree put it, a “Salvadoran gulag.” 
The Democratic caucus spends a lot of time trying to get messaging right, Pingree said, and in turn ends up making things complicated, though she vowed to try to make things as clear as possible. 
At the request of another attendee, she also said she’d pitch to her colleagues having short, to the point “COVID-19-pandemic era style” press conferences to outline the implications of Trump’s policies for all Americans. 
Ultimately, however, Pingree said she’s never going to “win” as just one member of Congress, nor can the 215 Democrats in the House. 
“We’ve talked a lot about Democrats today and I’ll take it all on my shoulders,” Pingree said. “I will try to do everything better and I will do everything I can to get my colleagues to do it better. But in the long run, [Republicans] control the House. They control the Senate. We only need three of them to change their minds.” 
Not all attendees wanted Pingree to provide a better backstop against the Trump administration. One attendee from Portland questioned whether she’ll always act reflexively against whatever Trump does. 
Pingree countered that she wouldn’t always but so far she hasn’t supported the president’s actions.
“If Donald Trump does things that I’m in favor of — if there are tariffs that I think makes sense — I would be wholeheartedly behind them,” Pingree said. “If there are things that [Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] does to remove toxins from our food or get rid of dyes and colors or support regenerative agriculture, I will wholeheartedly be in favor of it.”
While much of the night focused on federal policies, some attendees asked Pingree to weigh in on related state-level issues and had some local Democratic members of the state Legislature in attendance to listen in: Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson, Sen. Tim Nangle and Reps. Drew Gattine, Suzanne Salisbury and Morgan Rielly. 
One constituent raised concern about the dismantling of the federal Department of Education having implications for the state, which is separately facing a budget deficit. 
Anna Kellar, executive director of the League of Women Voters, asked Pingree if she would oppose the referendum to require identification at the polls.
Pingree did not provide a direct answer, but Kellar raised this question in relation to the representative’s recent vote against the SAVE Act that would require voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, which Pingree criticized as a sort of “poll tax,” given the cost of passports and argued would disenfranchise married women, given that many change their name. 
Kellar told Maine Morning Star after the town hall that they weren’t surprised Pingree did not weigh in on the state issue, adding that the League hasn’t made a formal request to her office for a stance yet. 
However, Kellar appreciated Pingree’s focus on some of the lesser known consequences of the SAVE Act, such as the implications for married women, and said the League is hoping to similarly highlight impacts of the state referendum that Kellar and others argue would make voting harder. 
“I think [Pingree] can help us connect those dots,” Kellar said. “I do think that there is a really important role that she could play here.”

Brad Little signed into law a bill to let ivermectin be sold as an over-the-counter medicine — without a prescription or consultation with a health care professional.
Typically used to treat parasites in humans, ivermectin has drawn interest since the COVID pandemic — after largely conservative activists, doctors and politicians inaccurately touted it as an alternative medicine.
Usually, the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration, or FDA, handles whether drugs should be made available over-the-counter, a process that uses data on safety and effectiveness.
The FDA hasn’t approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, saying the federal agency finds existing clinical trial data don’t show “ivermectin is effective against COVID-19 in humans.” The federal regulator’s website also warns large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous,” overdose can risk death, and human-appropriate doses can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners.
Little on Monday signed Senate Bill 1211, the ivermectin deregulation bill, according to the governor office’s legislation tracker. The new law takes effect immediately — through an emergency clause.
Passed during the last week of this year’s legislative session, Idaho lawmakers didn’t hear public feedback on the bill from doctors, pharmacists or health care professionals.
The bill was cosponsored by the top Republicans in the Idaho House and Senate — Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star — along with two other lawmakers: Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene.
Pam Eaton, CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association which represents Idaho pharmacies, testified in Senate committee that without an over-the-counter label that includes information like drug interactions, Idaho pharmacies largely can’t sell ivermectin over-the-counter.
Two states allow ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter, according to local news reports: Arkansas passed a law this year, and Tennessee passed a law three years ago. North Carolina is considering a similar bill.

Nancy Mace told Republicans at a county convention Monday that she was among the targets of a Pennsylvania man charged last week with threatening to kill President Donald Trump and other officials.
The 1st District congresswoman said U.S. Capitol Police called her while she was on her way to Greenville to inform her that Shawn Monper threatened to kill her too in an online post in January.

“He wanted to put a bullet in my head. No way!” she told about 1,000 people gathered for the Greenville County GOP convention.
Monper, 32, of Butler, Pennsylvania, was arrested last Wednesday and accused of threatening to kill Trump, Elon Musk, immigration agents, and others, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday.
According to the release, threats from a self-identified “Mr. Satan” were posted on YouTube between Jan. 15 and April 5. They included a Feb. 17 threat to kill Trump, Musk, all of Trump’s appointed directors and “anyone who stands in the way.”
Mace told the crowd she was the only known member of Congress named in the threats.
Fox News was first to report Mace being a target. Mace told reporters from the Gazette and other outlets at the convention before taking the stage to address the convention as a guest speaker.
“I will not back down to the threats,” Mace told reporters. “I will not back down to the intimidation. I will not back down to anyone who is threatening to put a bullet in my head.”
U.S. Capitol Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night about Mace’s claims. And a Mace spokeswoman did not respond when asked if authorities were pursuing additional charges related to threats against her.
According to the Department of Justice, the FBI was alerted to the threats on April 8, and the internet activity of “Mr. Satan” came from Monper’s home. The statements included claims of stocking up on guns and ammunition to “do a mass shooting.”
Trump survived a pair of assassination attempts, the first at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, when the gunman’s bullets killed one attendee, seriously injured two others, and injured Trump’s ear before Secret Service agents killed him.
Mace, who is considering a 2026 bid for governor, told reporters she’s close to a decision. She said she’s spoken to Trump about running to replace term-limited Gov. Henry McMaster and knows the president’s endorsement isn’t guaranteed.
“I don’t manage what he does or how he does it or who he endorses,” she said. “But if I do run, I’ll be working very hard to get his support.”
Mace, first elected to represent the coastal 1st District in 2020, cast herself to the GOP faithful in South Carolina’s largest county as someone who will bring Trump’s “America first” agenda to South Carolina “from the state all the way down to the local level.”
She repeatedly said she will not back down despite the threats.
“I will stand up for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance every day of the week. I don’t care,” she told the crowd.
“I will never stop fighting for Donald J. Trump,” she said to conclude her speech, calling to voters’ mind the moment of defiance when Trump mouthed “fight” and pumped his fist after getting shot in Pennsylvania.
She left the stage to a standing ovation.
Next to take the stage as guest speaker was state Treasurer Curtis Loftis. The headliner was longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, who spent four months in federal prison last for defying a congressional subpoena.
Attendees told the Gazette they believe Mace definitely has a chance of becoming the next governor, citing her loyalty to Trump and name recognition.
A Winthrop Poll in February found that South Carolinians were more familiar with Mace than any other potential Republican candidate for governor they were asked about.
Mace has been criticized recently for not holding an in-person town hall to answer her constituents’ questions. She has repeatedly cited safety concerns as the reason why.
She held a surprise virtual town hall last week, though she didn’t promote it or give advance notice.
“We will do in-person town halls as soon as it’s safe to do so,” she told reporters at the convention. “But I’ve had multiple bomb threats. I’ve had people threaten to blow up my office multiple times.”
If she runs, Mace is expected to be part of a crowded field that will potentially include Lt. Gov Pam Evette, Attorney General Alan Wilson, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, and state Sens. Sean Bennett of Summerville and Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration on Monday launched an investigation into the Washington office tasked with overseeing public schools, citing allegations that the state directed a school district to implement a gender inclusion policy that conflicts with federal law.
The investigation puts the 1,800-student La Center School District at the middle of the escalating battle between the U.S. Department of Education and the state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction over approaches to inclusivity in schools.
The Department of Education alleges OSPI is violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment and Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools and education programs that receive federal funding. 
An OSPI spokesperson called the Department of Education’s intervention a “potential overreach of the federal government’s authority.” 
The probe is the latest development in a yearslong battle between the Clark County district and the state. The saga has consumed La Center to the point that a timeline of the conflict is posted on the district website’s landing page.
The clash is centered on a debate over preferred pronouns.
In 2022, district Superintendent Peter Rosenkranz ordered staff not to ask students about their pronouns. Rosenkranz told teachers they should still use students’ preferred pronouns if requested. 
A teacher, who was also the adviser for the La Center High School Gay Straight Alliance, argued the policy “creates a systemic barrier towards full inclusivity of LGBTQ students.”
In late February of this year, the state found La Center violated state law related to discrimination based on gender identity. Its gender-inclusive policy also didn’t comply with statute, the state investigation determined. 
Washington’s model policy, adopted in 2020, says school staff must “privately ask known transgender or gender-expansive students how they would like to be addressed in class, in correspondence to the home, and at conferences with the student’s parent/guardian.”
The district also differed with the state policy on communicating with parents of gender-expansive students, according to the OSPI investigation. The district’s policy tells staff to “be transparent with parents/guardians of children who question their gender identity so that the parents/guardians may provide appropriate support for their children.”
It also states that “curriculum, instruction, and gender affirming activities may cause gender confusion for children.”
In a school board meeting, a former La Center student shared how this policy affected them. They said district staff “forcibly outed” them to their family, leading to “physical abuse by a family member, significant disruption to their education, and a negative impact on their mental health,” according to the OSPI investigation.
The state’s report said La Center’s policy “does not address the unique challenges and needs faced by transgender students in public schools in a nondiscriminatory manner.”
Rising tensions
The state ordered La Center to rescind the pronoun directive and send a new proposed policy that complies with state law within 45 days. Within 35 days of approval, the district had to implement the policy. 
OSPI also required training for staff on bias based on gender identity.
The district appealed the findings last month.
In an interview Monday, the La Center superintendent, Rosenkranz, said he was “very happy” to hear of the federal inquiry. He wants the district to be able to focus on academics, but said “OSPI is trying to bully the La Center School District into submission,” with threats to withhold federal funding if school officials don’t follow state law.
“We continue to move forward to support families as they raise their children,” Rosenkranz said. “The state is choosing to deny parents of that right.”
After reading a news story about the district’s battle with the state, Department of Education officials reached out to Rosenkranz to learn more, he said, leading to Monday’s investigation announcement.
OSPI spokesperson Katy Payne said in an email that the agency “will continue to steadfastly follow the laws of the state of Washington, which provide clear civil rights protections for our transgender and gender-expansive youth that fit squarely inside the protections provided under federal law.”
The U.S. Department of Education didn’t provide comment late Monday.
The inquiry significantly intensifies tensions between the state and federal government. Most of this conflict in the education sphere since President Donald Trump took office in January has focused on transgender athletes.
For example, the Kennewick School District in eastern Washington late last month filed a complaint with the feds over the state allowing trans athletes to participate in girls’ and women’s sports. 
Also last month, the Department of Education launched an investigation into the Tumwater School District, near Olympia, for letting a transgender athlete from another school compete in a girls’ high school basketball game. 
Washington is now also the latest state to face the education department’s ire. Federal officials have also launched investigations in California and Maine over alleged Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act violations. 
In a letter last month, Education Secretary Linda McMahon told schools they must abide by the law “if they expect federal funding to continue.”
“Attempts by school officials to separate children from their parents, convince children to feel unsafe at home, or burden children with the weight of keeping secrets from their loved ones is a direct affront to the family unit,” McMahon wrote. “When such conduct violates the law the Department will take swift action.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P27-Inauguration-250115-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 22:02:23.861769

Josh Shapiro's official residence early Sunday morning. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Harrisburg man charged with setting fire to Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence Sunday had a turbulent life marked by other legal troubles, public records show. 
Cody Balmer, 38, was originally scheduled to appear in court this week to answer simple assault charges stemming from a 2023 domestic assault. It involved an altercation with his former wife and stepson after Balmer had attempted suicide by taking a bottle of pills, he told police according to court records.
Although the latest accusations against Balmer bear the hallmarks of a religiously motivated crime, an expert on extremism said the man’s online footprint shows no immediate indication of ties to extremist groups or ideology. 
“One definitely has to consider that he firebombed a Jewish governor’s residence on Passover. I don’t think that can be ignored,” said Luke Baumgartner, research fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism. “Until more robust reporting or more detailed court documents come forward, nothing is really off the table right now.”

Balmer is charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses. He was arraigned in district court Monday afternoon where he pleaded not guilty and District Judge Dale Klein denied Balmer’s attorney’s request for reasonable bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released. 
Authorities said Balmer scaled the fence at the governor’s residence in downtown Harrisburg shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday and evaded state troopers on Shapiro’s security detail after he was detected on the grounds. State police allege Balmer broke a window and threw a Molotov cocktail into the ground floor of the residence before breaking a second window and entering the ceremonial dining room, where he used a second incendiary to set it ablaze.
Balmer escaped after starting the fire, but turned himself in at state police headquarters later Sunday. He told investigators he harbored hatred toward Shapiro and that if Balmer had encountered Shapiro inside the home he would have attacked the governor  with a hammer he carried.
In a news conference Sunday afternoon, Shapiro noted he had celebrated the first night of Passover with his family and guests in that room hours before they were awakened by a trooper and directed to evacuate. A steely voiced Shapiro vowed the act of violence would not deter him from doing his job to represent Pennsylvanians or to proudly observe his Jewish faith.
Balmer’s Facebook profile shows he’s a father who worked as an auto mechanic, although a former employer distanced itself from Balmer in a social media post saying he had not worked there in more than two years. 
His mother Christie Balmer told CBS news that her son struggled with mental illness and had not been taking his psychiatric medication. Balmer said in court Monday that he had been living with his parents for the past year. 
“This would have never happened if I could have gotten some help the middle of last week because I tried to get him picked up [by police] … and I went through four police departments and I couldn’t get anybody to help,” she said.

“So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened,” she said. Balmer said in court that he had been off his medication because it “led me to different types of behavior,” but he did not elaborate.
Attempts by the Capital-Star to reach Christie Balmer and other relatives at numbers listed in public records were unsuccessful.
Although Balmer denied being mentally ill during his court appearance, Dauphin County court records suggest Balmer had experienced mental health issues several years prior.
In a criminal complaint from January 2023, police said they were called to Balmer’s home in Penbrook, outside Harrisburg, by a child who reported his stepfather was beating his mother. When police arrived, Balmer’s wife Adrian Jones was outside the home crying and yelling about Balmer having assaulted her. 
He told police he had taken a bottle full of pills in an attempt to kill himself and an argument between himself and his wife escalated to the point that his stepson attempted to intervene. Balmer admitted shoving his son and a physical altercation between all three followed. 
Jones said Balmer struck her in the face, bit her hand and struck their 13- and 10-year-old sons. He was charged with three misdemeanor counts of simple assault and was scheduled to appear Wednesday at a plea hearing in Harrisburg, court records say.
Balmer was also charged in 2015 after attempting to cash a forged paycheck for $3,560 at two separate M&T Bank branches on the same day. He pleaded guilty to forgery and was sentenced to 18 months of probation. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Court records show Balmer’s former home in Penbrook was subject to foreclosure proceedings and a sheriff’s sale in 2023. He and Jones also reached an agreement in 2023 for the custody of their daughters in which Balmer received primary physical custody.
Balmer’s Facebook posts delve into politics, but provide no clear evidence of his allegiances. Dauphin County voter registration records show he chose not to be affiliated with any party.
Baumgartner, the extremism researcher at George Washington University, said social media is often used to assess ideological leanings of a suspect in a high profile crime, but cautioned that the initial readings don’t give a full picture. 
He noted that Thomas Matthew Crooks, whom the FBI identified as the gunman who fired at now-President Donald Trump during a July campaign rally, killing a supporter and injuring two others, initially appeared to have no extreme ideological leanings. The FBI later said a social media account believed to belong to Crooks espoused political violence and anti-immigrant and anti-semitic sentiments.
Many of Balmer’s more recent posts are marked private or have been deleted and no posts more recent than the summer of 2023 were visible Sunday. Those that are available include videos from conservative former Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, now director of National Intelligence in the Trump administration, and former Libertarian U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.
His posts express opposition to former President Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, the GOP and the Democratic Party. He also posted memes critical of the COVID-19 pandemic response, suggesting that the media and government overreacted and taking pride in disobeying lockdown orders.
Other posts suggest an inclination toward political violence or crime. One post from 2022 shows a needlepoint hoop with a flaming Molotov cocktail and the words “Be the light you want to see in the world.”

Another theme among his posts are memes with misogynistic and degrading messages about women and male erasure. “Toxic women destroy good men too, but we barely talk about that,” one post says.
There was also at least one post praising a man who was arrested after allegedly hitting dozens of women and another depicting former comedian Bill Cosby suggesting that women he was convicted (and later cleared) of assaulting were promiscuous before he allegedly drugged them. 
Baumgartner said misogyny is often an underlying motivation in far-right extremism, but Balmer doesn’t appear to fit neatly into any ideological category and seems to draw from several. He also expressed opposition to racism and endorsed many traditionally liberal values.
“I didn’t see anything that is indicative of any extremist ideology,” Baumgartner said. “For the most part, it was just sort of run-of-the-mill, ‘I don’t like either party’ content.’”

Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, speaks on the House floor on April 14, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s House majority leader urged a state lawmaker Monday to forgo her legislative pay for a week of the session she missed while taking a family vacation.
Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, returned Monday after missing five days at the Capitol to go with her family on an annual vacation. 
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he met with VanWinkle to ask where she had been.
“She indicated to me that she was on vacation, and I said, ‘That’s inappropriate for a legislator to take vacation during a legislative session.’”
VanWinkle defended her absence and said she’s being unfairly criticized for spending time with her family.
“I don’t know why I’m being singled out in my absence and why everybody else isn’t,” she said. “So it’s a little bizarre to me.” 
North Dakota lawmakers meet for up to 80 days every two years. Lefor said he does not recall any lawmaker taking a family vacation during a legislative session. He said he recently missed his first day over the past 10 years to attend the funeral of his mother-in-law.
Lawmakers are paid $213 per day during the legislative session on top of a $592 monthly salary, said John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council.

Lefor said he does not have the authority to withhold VanWinkle’s pay during her vacation, but suggested she voluntarily give her daily pay back during the time she was absent.
At the end of each floor session, lawmakers routinely vote to excuse absent members. Last Thursday, while VanWinkle was absent, House members voted 55-41 to excuse absent members, with unusually high opposition to the absences.
That vote is largely ceremonial, however, according to Bjornson. State law says lawmakers are “entitled” to be paid.
The only time the Legislative Council has withheld pay from a lawmaker are instances when the lawmaker volunteers to give back the pay for being absent.
“If they ask not to be (paid), we won’t,” Bjornson said.
VanWinkle suggested the House do an audit of lawmaker absences during the session to determine if criticism of her missing days is warranted. She said she hasn’t taken any sick days and she said other lawmakers have taken additional days off around the crossover break.
“Give me the answer, are we allowed absent days, or not?” she said.
VanWinkle said the focus on her absences is an attempt to silence her for her opinions. Earlier this session, VanWinkle drew public backlash for some controversial comments about in-vitro fertilization.
“This just falls right in line with all of their efforts to basically intimidate me and make me feel like I can’t say the things that I’m saying,” she said.
Lefor said telling someone to come to work is not an attempt to silence them.
“The constituents that elect us are ultimately the final say on whether we are sitting here or not,” Lefor said. “If her constituents look at this and want her back, that’s what it is.”
The Legislative Management Committee may discuss the absence policy during the interim, Lefor said.
“It’s things that you don’t think you need to address because I didn’t ever expect to see this,” Lefor said.
Rep. Bob Martinson, R-Bismarck, said he doesn’t think the absence policy should be changed.
“Most of us don’t take vacations during the session,” Martinson said.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said it is pretty hard to tell people whether they can or cannot leave during the legislative session. If the policy were to change to authorized absences, he said he worries the leadership in each chamber would be responsible for qualifying every acceptable absence.
“I don’t think anybody in leadership wants to go down that road,” Weisz said. “The voters put them here and expect them to be here as much as possible.”

Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, mingles ahead of Gov. Mike Kehoe's inauguration ceremony. Brattin's bill on ballot measures passed the House Monday evening (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A bill that would give the Missouri Attorney General the authority to appeal judges’ decisions to temporarily block state law and change how ballot measures are written and certified was sent to the governor Monday. 
The House gave final approval to the bill in a 109-46 vote, with Democrats calling the legislation a “power grab” that targets a Jackson County judge’s temporary hold on the state’s strictest abortion regulations and opening the door for Missouri clinics to resume surgical abortions.
“There is pending litigation going on right now,” said state Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Columbia Democrat. “The Attorney General doesn’t like how it’s going because there’s a preliminary injunction issued, so (Republicans) are trying to jam legislation through so they can change the outcome of the litigation.”
The bill passed Monday would allow Attorney General Andrew Bailey to challenge the preliminary injunction before the judge issues a final ruling on the case.
Democrats argued that since the legislation allows for appeals on “any preliminary injunction that existed prior to August 28, 2025,” it is retroactive and unconstitutional.
State Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Springfield, called the accusation “ridiculous.”
“There’s only one ongoing case that this power grants that it could possibly be used for,” he said.
The House passed an emergency clause on the provision, making it effective as soon as the governor signs it into law. The emergency clause says that “immediate action is necessary to ensure judicial efficiency.”
Missouri law limits emergency clauses to when they are “necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.”
The bill’s House handler, state Rep. Ben Keathley, a Chesterfield Republican, justified the clause because action could “save the lives of women in (facilities that perform abortions) and the children that are the unnecessary victims of these acts.”
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, said this provision was not part of the bill.
“We’re not voting on what the court may do one day,” she said.
The emergency clause passed along party lines with the bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, smiling at the House dais.
Provisions on ballot measures from the General Assembly also drew criticism from Democrats who disagreed with shifting power from the courts to the Missouri Secretary of State.
The bill would give the Secretary of State three chances to rewrite ballot language proposed by state lawmakers after the initial summary is challenged. The courts are charged with giving the Secretary of State advice and approving the final language.
State Rep. Eric Woods, a Kansas City Democrat, said the legislation is an “entire upheaval” of the current process.
“The court exists as a check on us in case we turn out some language that… has ballot candy on it which is completely unrelated to the topic at hand or something that is entirely intended to trick people into voting for it,” Woods said.
He referenced a joint resolution the House is prepared to discuss Tuesday with language he says is deceitful to voters.
Keathley said the courts should be “the last step in the process.”
“We have a constitutional duty and job to send that ballot language through. The courts are only there to call the balls and strikes,” he said.
Since the court has the final say, he said, there is still separation of powers.

Alyssa Brown speaks in favor of bill that would prohibit DEI in local government on April 14, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Legislation banning diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices at the local level passed the Arkansas House of Representatives Monday, sending the bill to the governor’s desk.
Senate Bill 520 is one of several bills targeting culture war issues that have been taken up during the 2025 legislative session. The bill, if it becomes law, would prohibit DEI “offices, officers, policies, or practices in local government.”
Under the proposed law, local governments would be prohibited from implementing hiring and employment policies that take into account diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI offices, or programs, policies, practices or applicant statements that promote DEI.
Local officials or contractors would also be prohibited from compelling another official or contractor to “personally affirm, adopt, or adhere” to certain beliefs or ideals specified in the bill. 
Private citizens would have a right to sue local governments if they do not cease violations of the prohibition within 30 days of being notified under the bill.
Senate Bill 520 is sponsored by Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, in the House and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, in the Senate. Sullivan also sponsored Act 116 of 2025, which repealed state affirmative action programs and prohibited “discrimination or preferential treatment by state entities.”
Sullivan told the Senate last week that the state needed to align itself with the current presidential administration’s positions on DEI. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January that shut down DEI programs within the federal government, and the government has targeted federal grants for cancellation for not complying with the administration’s positions on DEI. 
Rep. Jessie McGruder, D-Marion, criticized the bill on the House floor Monday, asking why SB 520 was targeting local governments when state GOP lawmakers placed so much emphasis on maintaining and returning “local control” to cities and counties. 
“I’m trying to get an understanding of why we’re doing this, because we always say ‘local control,’” McGruder said. “So each city should be able to control what’s happening within their community. We don’t understand the differences in the dynamics that occur in each and every community.”
Brown appeared to take issue with McGruder’s comments when closing for her bill.
“We don’t get to gaslight members with this idea of local control that takes away what is deemed constitutional. We wouldn’t let a local government take away the Second Amendment rights of their citizens,” Brown said. “This bill is about making sure we’re consistent with what we’ve passed on a state level.”
Brown added that “discrimination is illegal under federal and state civil rights law, but this bill ensures that in the process of preventing discrimination, we do not allow our local government to discriminate in its policies.”

Time is fast running out. And there are no visible signs of progress.
But University of Idaho and University of Phoenix officials insist they haven’t given up on the idea of a partnership.
“We continue to be excited about the proposed affiliation with the University of Idaho and the opportunity to support important educational and workforce needs in the state of Idaho,” University of Phoenix spokeswoman Andrea Smiley said in an email to Idaho Education News last week. “The two universities will continue to collaborate to find solutions.”
“We continue to see incredible value in University of Phoenix,” U of I spokeswoman Jodi Walker told EdNews in an email. “However, next steps are in the hands of Phoenix and its ownership team.”
But the State Board of Education has the U of I on a deadline to close a deal with Phoenix, a for-profit online university serving some 85,000 students. That deadline, June 10, is quickly approaching.
And what’s more, the State Board agreed to an extension in order to give the two universities time to win over skeptical legislators. And that hasn’t happened — at least not publicly.
The 2025 legislative session came and went without a Phoenix bill, a committee hearing, or any kind of vote. That silence stood in a stark contrast to the 2024 session. The Legislature stymied the $685 million Phoenix deal — with the Idaho Senate killing a bill that would have restructured the purchase — after lawmakers complained that they had been left in the dark by the parties’ closed-door negotiations.
In short, U of I and Phoenix officials now have less than two months to settle on a deal to meet the State Board’s deadline. And with the Legislature adjourned until January, it isn’t clear how lawmakers would have a chance to weigh in on a revamped deal — unless they returned to Boise for a special session.
In the meantime, as the U of I suggests, the next move belongs to Phoenix.
The State Board’s extension also gave Phoenix the latitude to talk to other would-be buyers. Phoenix is continuing to explore “other transaction opportunities,” Smiley said.
One option could involve going public.
As Bloomberg reported in March, Phoenix’s ownership groups are considering an initial public offering, perhaps as early as the third quarter of 2025.
And what about the State Board — which has the U of I on the clock?
The State Board did not respond to a request for comment.
The board meets Wednesday and Thursday at the U of I. And while U of I President C. Scott Green is expected to address the board and deliver the university’s annual report, the board has no Phoenix-related item on its agenda.

Senate Bill 2307, sponsored by Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, would allow people who challenge library content to seek a state’s attorney’s opinion if they don’t agree with a local content review process. 
If the content is deemed obscene by the state’s attorney and not removed, state funding to the library or school could be withheld. The bill also allows a state’s attorney to prosecute violations, though it’s not clear who would be prosecuted.
Implementing the bill is estimated to cost $1.1 million for 2025-27, or $2 million over the next four years, to add an age verification system for the state’s online library database. 
Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, who voted against the bill, said the bill’s fiscal note doesn’t address the costs that will be added to county state’s attorney’s offices.
Committee recommends ‘do not pass’ on controversial North Dakota library content bill

“The cost of this was not determined and, of course, was a concern for the (Appropriations) Committee,” Murphy said.
Other critics of the bill have said there will be additional costs for local libraries to implement it.
The House Appropriations Committee issued a do-not-pass recommendation for the bill on a 22-1 vote Friday.
Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, who voted in favor of the bill, said the $1.1 million in costs for the age verification was a small price to pay to ensure that obscene content is kept from children.
He said he found it odd the House Judiciary Committee voted 12-1 to recommend passage of the bill while the House Appropriations Committee came to the opposite result.
Many comments from lawmakers referred to some library content as pornography.
“By passing this bill, we affirm that taxpayer dollars should never be used to purchase pornography,” said Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake.
One book lawmakers objected to was the “Heartstopper” LGBTQ graphic novel series that had been challenged at the Forman school library. The bill sponsor also distributed a list of the American Library Association’s top challenged books, along with a list of which North Dakota libraries carried them. Many of the books have LGBTQ themes or discuss sexual assault. 
In a statement, the ACLU of North Dakota said the bill amounts to censorship and questioned who will decide what is considered obscene or sexually explicit.
“Government officials cannot impose their personal moral values on others,” Cody Schuler, ACLU of North Dakota advocacy manager, said in a statement. “If you don’t like a book, don’t read it – or don’t let your kids read it. It’s as simple as that.”
Barring a reconsideration of Monday’s House vote, the bill will be sent to Gov. Kelly Armstrong for his consideration.

(Photo by F. Jimenez/National Park Service)Opponents of a controversial predator control program in Western Alaska are seeking a court order to halt this year’s work before state officials kill any more bears.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance last week filed an application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the state Department of Fish and Game from starting its planned bear- and wolf-killing program in late spring and early summer. If the predator control takes place, it would be the third year of a state program that has so far killed 180 bears and 19 wolves.
The program is aimed at boosting the population of the faltering Mulchatna Caribou Herd. The herd, which in the 1990s numbered about 200,000, is down to only about 15,000, according to the Department of Fish and Game. Hunting of those caribou has been closed since 2021.
Even though a state judge ruled on March 14 that the program violates the Alaska constitution, the Department of Fish and Game is preparing to embark on its third year of bear and wolf removals. The Alaska Board of Game on March 27 approved the department’s emergency petition to resume the program.
Department officials, in arguing in favor of the emergency determination, told board members that they needed to be able to get into the field in time for the caribou calving season to make sure that bears are not preying on newborn calves.
The department contends that predation, mostly by bears, is keeping the Mulchatna Caribou Herd population low.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance and other opponents of the predator control program contend that the state’s plan is based on faulty science and that other factors, including habitat changes, are responsible for the drop in caribou numbers. They argue that the state’s program could harm bear populations, including the internationally famous population that roams Katmai National Park and Preserve.
The March 14 ruling came in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi found that the predator control program violated constitutional mandates for due process and sustained yield.
A separate but similar lawsuit filed by Anchorage attorney Michelle Bittner is still pending.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance, in its April 10 memorandum in favor of a restraining order, said the state’s efforts to continue killing bears “suggests the Department and Board are contemptuous” of the judiciary’s role in interpreting the state constitution.
The emergency regulation was not justified or legal, the memorandum argued. “The effort to circumvent the court’s ruling (in) this case through an emergency regulation is misguided and unlawful. Blatant efforts to sidestep court rulings must be recognized by the judiciary as such, and rejected,” the document said.
The Alaska Department of Law will take action to support the predator-control plan, a spokesperson said.
“The State’s position is that the Board acted within the available law to address an emergency regulation petition. The State intends to oppose the motion,” Patty Sullivan of the Department of Law said by email.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate voted Monday to set residency requirements for classes enrolling in University of Iowa medical and dental programs, despite concerns from some lawmakers that it would create an unfair, affirmative action program in highly sought-after fields.
House File 516, which would require that 80% of students accepted to the UI doctor of medicine or dentistry programs be residents of Iowa or fulfill other qualifications, passed the Iowa Senate with a vote of 34-11.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, filed an amendment that would have barred the UI from lowering its admission standards and the Iowa Board of Regents from penalizing the university if it doesn’t reach the 80% mark. Trone Garriott said these changes would ensure that lower-quality candidates are not chosen over their peers because the university needs to meet a quota.
“The most qualified applicants should be our priority for Iowa’s medical school, but the majority party is going to mandate quotas give special status to one group of students over others based on identity rather than merit,” Trone Garriott said.

She was joined by Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, and other Senate Democrats in calling the proposed requirements an affirmative action program, as it gives preference to a certain group of people based on an aspect of their identity. The debate comes as Republican lawmakers and the governor-appointed regents have been purging programs and policies from state universities related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
To make exceptions for certain applicants because they’re from Iowa would put a stain on all others enrolled in the programs, Bisignano said, and a codified requirement to maintain standards would help push against the possibility of giving Iowans special treatment.
“We’re not talking in those terms, but it’s an affirmative action program. We’re going to weight it towards Iowa applicants,” Bisignano said. “But that doesn’t work in medicine, because not only do you want the best and the brightest, but that’s what draws your investment money in your research, is the quality and the level of your doctors and your research scientists.”
The amendment failed to pass.
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, also filed an amendment that would have applicants state whether they are an Iowa resident, have graduated from an Iowa high school, have family in Iowa or who graduated from an Iowa high school or college, or have lived in a rural community with similar characteristics to Iowa communities.
If none of these qualifications apply to the applicant, Klimesh said they can express interest in completing their medical residency or practicing in the state after graduation. The amendment passed.
“The additional questions we’re asking an amendment 3069 now put Iowa in the same league as other states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, who ask very specific questions of their incoming applicants to ensure they’re getting the mix they need to provide health care in those specific states,” Klimesh said.
The bill returns to the House for consideration of the Senate changes.

Photo by Erick Diaz VelizOn Friday morning, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees meeting at the Hannah Administration Building was disrupted several times by members of the public who advocated for issues including climate change and sexual assault awareness.
Terry Link, 65, founding director of the MSU Office of Campus Sustainability from 2000 to 2009, raised his hand several times without being seen while the board discussed the approval of the Spartan Gateway District.
The project is a major redevelopment effort aimed at transforming about 14 acres located at the southwest side of campus. It will include a hotel, market-rate housing, retail shops, restaurants, office space, parking, a roughly 6,000-seat arena for Olympic sports, and potential future facilities for academic or healthcare purposes.

Before the project was approved by the board, Link stood up and walked toward the podium. He emphasized what he said would be the project’s deceptive ecological impact and called for a reconsideration of its approval. His voice was drowned out by the audience’s applause and the insistent request by board secretary Stefan Fletcher for him to sit quietly.
Regardless, Link expressed his desire to bring up the environmental impact issue, claiming it was something that he needed to do before the approval could be made.
“The university continues to grow. With that growth, we construct new buildings, but instead of building, we’ll be destroying a large number of trees. As we continue to expand, we leave behind an immense footprint,” said Link. “Development we can no longer sustain. We have to reduce. We are exceeding our planet’s capacity. If we don’t change this, younger generations will have no place to live.”
The project was approved 5-1, with the lone no vote from Trustee Myke Balow. 
As Trustee Rema Vassar was finishing her final comment of the meeting, Valery Von Frank, director Parents of Sister Survivors Engage, or POSSE, an organization made up of survivors and parents from ex-MSU doctor Larry Nassar’s abuse, disrupted the meeting from the back of the room.
“None of you have talked about sexual assault awareness,” said Von Frank in her disruption. “You don’t remember. We don’t recall. It should be on the agenda, and yet you spend all your time reading other things.”
Earlier this year, this organization called for an investigation into three MSU trustees: Brianna Scott, Kelly Tebay, and Renee Knake Jefferson, arguing that they had violated the board policy that defines trustees’ fiduciary responsibilities.
“MSU has too soon forgotten what happened on this campus when 547 survivors came forward to MSU about the sexual assault that were committed by their employee,” Von Frank declared after the meeting ended.

The board did not provide any comment on the allegations Link and Von Frank made during the meeting, which followed the arrest of 19 people the night before during a pro-Palestinian sit-in protest held inside the building’s lobby.
The only comment that addressed the arrests during the meeting was from Balow, who stated that the university cares for students regardless of nationality or belief and that they will always be open to dialogue.
“As long as we are talking and discussing issues under the flag that guarantees our free speech, which many people have died for, we will move in the right direction. So, let’s deal with each other on a human level, lower the temperature, and seek to understand one another.” said Balow.
Beyond that, no member of the board directly addressed the arrests.
David Hogan, 20, a social relations and policy student and member of the Hurriya Coalition, who was part of the group of students who engaged in a dialogue table with university officials, said he wasn’t surprised nothing was said about the arrests. 
“They refuse to acknowledge the arrests because acknowledging the arrests would mean they would be forced to admit that they chose to have students arrested rather than actually working in any constructive way to come to some sort of agreement, or even a commitment to work towards some sort of agreement,” Hogan said.
A request for comment on the arrests, as well as the statements made by Link and Frank, was sent by the Advance to a university spokesperson, but was not returned.

The debate over spending is taking place alongside a discussion about how the state can keep paying for its needs — and whether legislators can keep adequate oversight and control over state dollars.
Friday, Senate Finance and Claims voted 13-9 to approve HB 2 after passing several amendments that added to its bottom line, and it will likely be on the floor Thursday.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, said HB 2 was costing a lot more for the 2027 biennium than the 2025 biennium, and he would be opposing it.
“My constituents did not send me here to spend 18% more than we did two years ago,” Fuller said.
But Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy, D-Box Elder, said he expected to see other proposals that would add more money to HB 2, and it was time to move the $16.6 billion legislation out of committee.
“I think that we need to use this as a cutoff, at least for now, slow it down a little bit,” Windy Boy said.
Some legislators want to slow down House Bill 924, too. Sponsored by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, the controversial piece of legislation would create a new trust fund for Montana.
Jones said the bill collects a lot of small funds that already existed — and people figured out how to raid — into one trust.
He said that fund will earn money for Montanans for generations to come in housing, childcare, disaster resiliency and more.
“This is kind of a Montana-made legacy and investment in the future,” Jones said.
Detractors, though, fear it was rushed into existence and loosens the grip legislators have on their ability to appropriate funds.
On the House floor last week, Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell, said he’d never seen a larger fiscal note than the one for HB 924.
The bill initially directs $679 million from the general fund into the trust.
Monday marks day 74 of the 2025 session, the Montana Legislature has 90 days to complete its work, and both bills are progressing.
At this point in the session, the state budget sometimes looks like it won’t pencil out, with numerous proposals to reduce income and property taxes still in play, and plenty of spending bills alive.
On top of that, prior to the session, a report from the Legislative Fiscal Division warned of the risks of recession and potential federal cuts.
It said continued income tax reductions and spending pressures raise a question about whether the governor’s proposed budget will mean income can match expenses by the 2029 fiscal year.
“Decisions of this magnitude will be made by the 2025 Legislature and will set up Montana’s state finances for success or failure for decades to come,” the report said.

The most recent calculation of bills in play by the Legislative Fiscal Division shows ongoing expenses outpacing ongoing revenues by 2026, and a gap of $500 million by the 2029 fiscal year.
However, the Legislature won’t pass all the bills that reduce income, and it will kill some of the spending ideas, although in a debate last week on the House floor, Falk said he’s worried by the trend.
“Even just the last few days, the line between structural deficit and breaking even has gotten quite a bit worse,” Falk said.
In a press availability Friday, Sen. Christopher Pope, D-Bozeman, said HB 2 is large in part because legislators want some ideas to stay in the mix, but only for the time being.
“There will be a reckoning, and there has to be a reckoning,” Pope said.
Too complex, or an investment for generations?
Jones described HB 924, the Growth and Opportunity Trust, as an opportunity for the legislature to have a significant and positive impact on Montanans for decades.
The bill, which received bipartisan support and opposition with a 53-44 final vote in the House, is a combination of several proposals the Montana Legislature had already heard, Jones said.
He said the trust “is a kind of a conservative, forward looking trust” that takes a portion of volatile revenues and “turns them into long-term assets.”
Montana has a coal trust, but Jones said it’s worth only about $1.2 billion, while other states have tens of billions of dollars in similar trusts, such as Alaska, with $80.3 billion, and Wyoming, with $11.6 billion.
The Montana trust fund would take in about 50% of volatile revenue, such as income from capital gains. He said half of the trust would reinvest funds, and the other half would distribute funds.
A fiscal analysis of the bill said allocations would go to local disaster resiliency, state property tax assistance, water development, bridges and early childhood programming.
Jones said the principle is protected, and withdrawal would require a two-thirds vote by the legislature. He said the bill allows Montana to store money, but it includes recession triggers for hard financial times.
“This is the acorn,” Jones said of the bill. “I’m hoping it will grow into an oak tree.”
Although the bill passed to the Senate, it elicited criticism from both Republicans and Democrats on the House floor.
Falk said the bill came much too late in the process given its heft and complexity, and he would have liked such legislation to be thoroughly vetted by the Legislative Finance Committee.
“If we’re taking tax revenue that creates a surplus, and it’s too high, I think we need to give it back to people,” Falk said. “We don’t even give them interest on their money.”
Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said the bill allocates money for specific purposes in advance, and she wasn’t sure legislators should box themselves out of future decisions that way.
“What this bill does is it takes away from your ability to spend future funds and ties the hands of future legislatures,” Gillette said.
Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said she liked the idea of being able to save money and prepare for the future.
However, Sullivan said she had concerns both about the authority the governor’s office has to reduce the size of transfers and how the bill reserves a portion of future income tax revenue.
She said the structure gives away some legislative power and oversight in the appropriations process.
“The legislature is in charge of appropriations, and we should keep doing our job in that space,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan also said property tax rebates proposed in the bill amount to just $40 for residents, and “we need to amp that up so it’s meaningful for taxpayers.”
Jones agreed that property taxpayers need more help, but he said the only way the executive can touch the funds is during emergencies as outlined with specific language and set triggers in the bill.
In support of the bill, Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, said it might not be the way he would write it, but it would make a difference for Montanans.
Karlen said legislators don’t always have the chance to take up bills that affect their constituents for generations to come.
“What’s in this bill is an ongoing, fiscally responsible way to support pensions, housing, critical infrastructure, water, our early childhood system,” Karlen said.
The bill will have a hearing Tuesday in Senate Finance and Claims.
HB 2 is expected to be on the Senate floor later this week, and the most recent report said the legislative proposal is 0.7% more than the governor’s budget.
In the meantime, a plan still needs to gel for a property tax decrease for residential payers, and an income tax reduction is expected too.
Falk said he’s only in his second session, but he thinks every session, projections show a negative structural balance “in the out years.”
“I think this is worse — way worse — than normal,” he said.
He said legislators will make reconciliations, erasing here and there, and the governor may veto some spending, but he sees the need for work ahead.
Pope sees work ahead as well.
He said he is proud of the work Democrats have done on their priorities, at times with help from nine Republicans in the Senate, whether it be increasing provider rates or help for housing.
At the tail end of the session, he said, the legislature is entering the firefight.
“We have to not only keep pursuing the things that remain undone, and there’s a fair amount of that, yet we also have to circle back every half hour to protect something that’s already been decided, and it can be harrowing,” Pope said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-520632182-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-04-14 20:06:24.441040

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Jumping into the discourse over Nebraska’s budget shortfall, State Auditor Mike Foley sent a letter to state senators Monday alerting them of the financial weight of previously-passed business tax incentive laws.
In a 20-page letter, he wrote that over the next four fiscal years, Nebraska companies stand poised to call in more than $1.5 billion in corporate tax incentives, an expense he said would significantly impact the availability of state general funds.

The auditor’s letter focuses on the Nebraska Advantage Act, adopted in 2005, and a newer version called the ImagiNe Nebraska Act of 2020.
He also highlighted the state’s “steadily increasing delinquent tax balances,” which Foley noted were generally unrelated to business tax incentives but still could constitute “hundreds of millions of tax dollars owed but not collected” by the Nebraska Revenue Department.
“When you combine over $1.5 billion in business tax incentives to be used over the next four fiscal years plus potentially hundreds of millions of dollars more in uncollected tax proceeds, the result is a staggering loss of revenue to the state  — all of which must be counterbalanced in some way,” Foley said in a media statement.
He added: “The Legislature must be made aware of these facts in order to pursue sound fiscal policies.”
33,000 jobs in two decades
Before he was auditor, Foley served as lieutenant governor under then-Gov. Pete Ricketts and before that was a state senator. He acknowledged that he supported economic development tax incentives.
But with lawmaker turnover and the “crush” of so many other policy matters and responsibilities, Foley said he suspects that “many senators may not be fully informed of how yesterday’s legislative decisions will most assuredly influence tomorrow’s policy choices.”











Regardless of how the credits are used to receive a tax benefit, the result is a reduction of the state’s tax revenues. 


– State Auditor Mike Foley



The auditor said he and his team recognize the benefit of business-focused economic incentive programs in that they can spur construction, investment and jobs to expand the tax base that helps pay for public services.
Foley acknowledged data from the Nebraska Department of Revenue indicating that corporate tax incentives reportedly have led to more than $25 billion in qualifying capital investments since 2006 and helped create more than 33,000 new full-time Nebraska jobs.
“Whether the claimed benefits are accurate or not, the significant tax breaks now being paid to corporate taxpayers are real and measurable,” Foley said. 
The auditor‘s team concluded that the Nebraska Advantage and ImagiNE Acts appear to contain some “operational inadequacies” that could result in the legislation becoming a “drain” as opposed to a “boon” to the state economy.

Gov. Jim Pillen said he appreciated Foley’s report. He said that when the “current iteration” of tax incentives passed, Nebraska was a high tax state. He described Nebraska now as competitive from an income tax perspective.
“I am of the firm belief that we need to refocus our tax incentive strategy and make them more people-focused and less company-focused,” Pillen said in a statement. “All Nebraska’s tax credit and relief programs should be focused on working class Nebraskans, not Fortune 500 companies.”
 Probe goes back decades

Foley said he does not mean to “opine” on the merits of the tax incentives, but hoped that the information he compiled for lawmakers would “prove worthy” of review in the Legislature’s search for additional revenue sources.
Lawmakers are starting to debate more fully on the floor different components of the two-year budget that by law must be balanced. The session ends June 9, and the latest projected shortfall is $289 million.
Last week the Legislature advanced to a second round of debate a package that would help close the budget gap by about $71 million, partly by clawing back several business-focused incentives and other initiatives that had been previously approved by Pillen and the Legislature.

The auditor’s Monday letter is based on several sources, including financial data found in the state’s accounting system and tax incentive reports, some dating back more than 25 years.
Foley explained incentives under the two key laws, Advantage and ImagiNE: A qualifying company earns annual credits for meeting specific employment and investment benchmarks, and those credits may be used at a later date for any of the following benefits: credit refunds of sales and use taxes paid; credit refunds or offsets of income taxes paid, and credit refunds of real property taxes paid. Additional benefits include direct refunds of sales and use taxes and personal property tax exemptions.
“Regardless of how the credits are used to receive a tax benefit, the result is a reduction of the state’s tax revenues,” said the letter. 
Under the Advantage Act, Foley said, participating companies have already qualified for $2.6 billion in tax credits, and about $1.4 billion remains unused. As of November, the letter said, requests by 57 businesses were pending to claim more credits.
 ‘Serious deficiencies’ 

Foley said that over the next four years, the Revenue Department projects the state will cover more than $1.1 billion in tax credits and direct sales and use tax refunds. That amount, in addition to the $421 million for the ImagiNE program, accounts for the $1.5 billion expense that the auditor foresees over the next four fiscal years.
He said the tax credits also impact other smaller political subdivisions. Said Foley: “When qualifying businesses use credits earned to obtain a refund of prior tax payments, including local-option sales and use taxes levied by municipalities, those local communities are denied an important source of revenue.”
He said that since 2005, nearly $163 million in local sales and use taxes have been refunded to qualifying companies, “resulting in a direct reduction of tax revenues originally intended” for the municipalities.
Foley pointed out “serious deficiencies” in state processes that check on businesses using tax incentives. He said the Department of Revenue is supposed to perform an initial qualification audit and, after that, periodic audits to verify the information. He said those are the department’s only mechanisms for ensuring that participating companies qualify for the benefits received.

The audit team reported that 14 of 20 companies reviewed lacked a timely qualification audit and 17 of those 20 never had a maintenance audit.
“Without the proper and consistent performance of qualification and maintenance audits, the department is incapable of confirming the occurrence of reports for either qualified capital investments or increases in new jobs — both of which were expected when the (Advantage Act) was being promoted to the Legislature,” he said.
The audit noted that the Advantage Act contained no limits on the amount of investment and compensation credits that companies may earn or use. The ImagiNE law did cap the total new annual tax incentives that can be granted.
 Business chamber perspectives 

Bryan Slone, outgoing CEO of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the 2005 Nebraska Advantage Act served the state’s economy through challenging economic times, and needed modernization. He described its successor, the ImagiNE Act, as a streamlined incentive program with “more targeted incentive benefits and reasonable structural caps on the potential state budget effect.”
In designing ImagiNE, Slone said, “the Legislature helped avoid the same tax administrative delays and uncertainties that have plagued the Nebraska Advantage Act.”  He said ImagiNE is “relevant to today’s economy, while fiscally constrained.”

Slone said Nebraska should still review business tax incentives periodically, in part to measure competitiveness with other states.
“With all of the economic uncertainties these days and a slowing of the economy, we need now more than ever to continue to remain focused on jobs, people attraction and retention, business expansion in our communities and economic growth.”
Heath Mello, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and former state senator, said his network remains steadfast in support of business tax incentives as “critical tools” in attracting and retaining quality jobs and investment.
Mello said a recent analysis from a site selection group ranked Nebraska 45th nationally in economic incentives. He called that a “disappointing” indicator of Nebraska losing opportunities to other states, “depriving” Nebraska of growth and tax revenue.
“The Chamber urges policymakers to stand firm in defense of Nebraska’s economic competitiveness and ensure we are positioned to win in an increasingly competitive national marketplace,” Mellow said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate sent legislation to the governor Monday making changes to Iowa’s election recount process.
House File 928, passed 31-14, would change who can request a recount for an election in Iowa. In races for local offices and the Iowa Legislature, the election would need to have a difference of 1% or 50 votes — whichever is less — for a candidate to request a recount. For statewide and federal races, that threshold is lowered to a 0.15% difference.
Election recount boards would change from their current make-up of a person designated by each candidate, alongside one other individual agreed upon by both candidates. The new system would have county auditors lead the board with their staff and hired election workers, with a requirement that boards must have equal numbers of workers from each political party. Candidates could also be able to choose up to five people to observe the recount in each county.
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, said these changes put Iowa’s recount process in line with other states, and addresses existing problems with potential conflicts of interest that exist in allowing campaigns to oversee the recount process.
“There’s no uniformity, no reliability or enforcement,” Rozenboom said. “That creates distrust the system.”
However, Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said the proposed changes to the recount system — allowing auditors to oversee election recounts — could create conflicts of interest if they are the incumbent party involved in an election recount. Rozenboom countered that county auditors would still be bound by the law to fairly administer recounts.
“I understand the nature of your question, but in the unlikely event that that happens, there’s still their responsibility to do that,” Rozenboom said. “And please note that there will be observers to watch that process.”
But Winckler said the current recount process serves Iowa well, without bringing up potential conflicts of interest posed by the county auditor — who is a partisan elected official — and their staff overseeing the process.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said in the recount elections she has been involved in, “balance” in the process was not an issue as both candidates got to appoint a member of the recount board, and saying that candidates “come out with much greater respect for the process” for ensuring fair election results.
“What we will have if we shift through this new model is candidates feeling very suspicious, very uncertain and not knowing if they can trust what they’re hearing as part of this process — and not feeling represented in it,” Trone Garriott said. “Just because someone is a member of the same political party does not ensure that that person has that candidate’s best interest at heart, or is qualified to be the representative, or is qualified to be part of this process.”
Rozenboom argued that these criticisms do not acknowledge that partisan county auditors are already overseeing elections.
“If we trust them to conduct the election in the first place, it seems reasonable to me that we would trust them to conduct a recount,” Rozenboom said.
The bill would also implement an earlier deadline for requesting a recount, requiring requests be submitted by the end of the day of the second Wednesday after an election. The current deadline is the second Friday after an election. Recounts would be requested through the Secretary of State’s office for legislative, statewide and federal races, a change from the current system where campaigns make requests to each county auditor.
Another portion of the bill requires recounts to be conducted using vote tabulators, whereas current law allows hand-counting in some areas.
Rozenboom said the measure will bring “consistency, reliability, fairness, uniformity and enforcement” to the state’s election recounts.
“Election law is maybe the most important legislation that we can pass in this state, because election law, fair elections, are the absolute bedrock of our system of government,” Rozenboom said. “This legislation will correct flaws in our current system.”

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor/Baraka photo by Fran Baltzer)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka joined members of major progressive organizations in New Brunswick Monday to celebrate their decision last week to endorse his gubernatorial bid.
Baraka, on his third term as mayor of New Jersey’s largest city, has made a push to claim the progressive lane in the crowded race to become New Jersey’s next governor as he vies with five other Democrats to win their party’s nomination on June 10.
He has rallied with protestors outside a planned immigrant jail in Newark, said the state should discuss reparations for slavery, and pushed for a universal basic income. And on Monday he called for “economic prosperity for all working families” alongside members of his new progressive backers, including the New Jersey Working Families Party, New Jersey Citizen Action, and Make the Road Action.
“This is not only our chance to push back against the failed and bankrupt and racist policies of Donald Trump, but it’s also an opportunity for us to build the democracy we want to see in New Jersey, to build economic prosperity for all working families so they’re not crushed by medical bills, they’re not crushed by housing costs, not crushed by inequality and lack of opportunity,” Baraka told an excited crowd outside a union building off the Rutgers University campus.
There are few public polls that have gauged Baraka’s support compared to his Democratic rivals. But a March 5 Fairleigh Dickinson University poll measuring the candidates’ favorability put Baraka on top with self-described progressives, with Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop tied for second. The other three Democrats in the race — Rep. Josh Gottheimer, teachers union chief Sean Spiller, and ex-state Sen. Steve Sweeney — were further behind.
Dan Cassino, director of the poll, said Baraka has taken a simple path to win the support of progressives: going far to the left of the median progressive. But Cassino said it’s unclear what will matter more to progressive voters — progressive policies or opposition to the establishment.  If progressive voters are mad about Trump’s policies, that may play out in Baraka’s favor, while Fulop may gain if more of them are upset about Democrats not standing up to Trump, Cassino said. Fulop has campaigned as an alternative to Democratic machine politics.
“If the race is framed around policy arguments, Baraka is likely to do very well, as his policy stances are rather to the left of his competitors,” Cassino said. “But we’ve seen that Fulop is doing his best to frame the race around opposition to the institutional party: if that’s what people are using to make their decisions, he’s likely to do better.”
Fulop, the three-term mayor of the state’s second-largest city, has touted his “smart, progressive leadership,” but on Monday said he doesn’t define his campaign as a progressive one, adding that he wants to win over moderate Democrats.
“We’ve been tremendously responsible on the financial front, how we think about housing, how we think about driving costs — so I think our campaign is a little different,” he said. “It is the broadest breadth of a coalition of anybody, and I think you’d be hard-pressed to peg us in one corner.”
Fulop brushed off the endorsements Baraka cinched from progressive groups, calling it “fine.” Tens of millions of dollars will be spent in the primary, Fulop said, and no single organization will influence the outcome.
Fulop said he wants to be the candidate with the most detailed policies. Appearing near his childhood home in Edison Monday, he discussed his new plan to make New Jersey more affordable, with ideas ranging from consolidating municipal resources to overhauling the nascent Stay NJ tax cut program for seniors.
Fulop did not mention Trump during his event, while Baraka made Trump’s economic policies and billionaire allies a focal point of his own rally. Baraka said voters are looking for leadership and conversations instead of wonky politician-speak that makes them feel left out.
“If policy was how you win elections, Elizabeth Warren would be on her second term,” he said. “The reality is, people need leadership. They need your voice. They need your action. They need you to inspire them. They need hope.”
Cassino believes the fight over the progressive voting bloc is “less about policy than it is about framing.”
“The question of who most appeals to progressive voters is a question of what concerns are on top of mind among voters at that moment,“ he said.

Rebecca Reimer, R-Chamberlain, speaks on the South Dakota House floor on March 6, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Getting an initiated constitutional amendment on the ballot in South Dakota is plenty tough for citizens. House Bill 1169 would have made it almost impossible.
HB 1169 required that signatures representing 5% of the votes cast for governor in the most recent election be collected from each of the state’s 35 Senate districts to get an initiated constitutional amendment on the ballot. Current law calls for collecting signatures totaling 10% of the votes cast for governor in the last election. Those signatures can come from anywhere in the state.
HB 1169 would have been something of a jobs program for accountants. Not only would petition carriers have needed to figure out 5% of the votes cast for governor in each Senate district, but they would also have had to make sure that their overall total of signatures equaled 10% of the vote total for governor.
The good news about HB 1169 is that it was vetoed by Gov. Larry Rhoden. In his veto message to the Legislature, Rhoden said he feared that the geographic requirement for the collection of signatures would be workable only for big-money groups that have the resources to canvass the entire state.
Legislature sustains veto of geographic signature requirement for constitutional amendment petitions

To override a veto, a two-thirds vote is needed in both chambers in the Legislature. That’s 24 votes in the 35-member Senate and 47 votes in the 70-member House. Fortunately, the Senate vote of 16-16 was not enough to override the veto. The governor’s veto stands, and that’s the good news. However, there’s plenty of bad news to go around.
Part of the bad news is the wide-ranging support that such an onerous change had in the Legislature. Bills with such success are usually destined to become law. HB 1169 flew through the House State Affairs Committee on a vote of 10-1 and through the House on a vote of 60-9. In the Senate State Affairs Committee, it fared just as well, earning passage on a 7-1 vote. It was only in the Senate where the bill met some resistance, but still passed, 19-15.
There was more bad news on the last day of the legislative session as the House voted 50-18 to override the veto. Fortunately, both chambers need to override the veto for the bill to become law.
Clearly, HB 1169 has plenty of backers in the Legislature. The bill’s main sponsor, Rep. Rebecca Reimer, a Chamberlain Republican, recognizes that and said in a South Dakota Searchlight story that she would work on the language in the legislation and bring it back next year.
In her testimony to the House State Affairs Committee, Reimer said passage of HB 1169 would ensure that rural voices are heard rather than letting petitioners set up shop in only Rapid City or Sioux Falls to collect signatures. She said the bill “ensures fairness, strengthens voter representation, protects the integrity of our constitutional amendment process.”
Maybe that’s one way to describe the bill. Another would be to say that it’s a cynical, bordering on sinister, attempt to cut citizens out of the initiated amendment process.
This isn’t the Legislature’s only accomplishment when it came to making it tougher for citizens to get their measures on the ballot. Already the subject of a lawsuit, legislators endorsed a bill that would cut the amount of time for gathering signatures by three months. Another measure they placed on the 2026 ballot would raise the threshold for approving a constitutional amendment to 60% rather than relying on a simple majority of voters.
It’s easier for lawmakers to get something on the ballot. They only have to convince a majority of their colleagues. If you’re not lucky enough to be in the Legislature, you have to collect 17,508 signatures for an initiated measure or referred law, or 35,017 signatures for an initiated constitutional amendment.
The bill that was so popular with lawmakers didn’t take into consideration the eccentric nature of legislative districts, the borders of which can veer off in odd directions. It would take a cavalry scout and a GPS for petitioners to figure out if they’re collecting their signatures in the right Senate district.
If one legislative district is stingy with its signatures, the entire effort fails. The state Supreme Court in Idaho struck down a similar law, saying it amounted to giving each legislative district veto power and calling it “tyranny of the minority.”
If Reimer has her way, that tyranny will make its way back to the Legislature in the next legislative session. Here’s hoping the governor has his veto pen ready.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republicans in the North Carolina Senate released their blueprint for state spending Monday evening, outlining a budget that raises pay for teachers and state workers, moves ahead with planned income tax cuts and sets aside money for future Hurricane Helene recovery spending.
The new plan from the GOP majority came with a pledge from its leader that legislators would eliminate “waste” and “bloated” spending from state government.
The two-year budget proposal sets out modest increases in spending, totaling $32.6 billion in 2025-26 and $33.3 billion the year after.
“Without a doubt, this is one of the fastest timelines that we’ve seen for pulling a budget together,” said Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) during a press conference.
Senators will begin moving the budget through their chamber this week; it is set for its first hearing Tuesday morning. When it passes the full Senate, it will move to the House. Leaders have agreed to a top-line spending total with the Senate, but the NC House will make changes and additions of their own.
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, has requested that the GOP-led legislature approve more extensive pay raises, spending on child care and affordable housing.
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch strongly criticized the plan Monday, calling it a “blueprint for neglect and cowardice.” She said it offered “pathetic raises” to public servants and “shortchanges” infrastructure needs.
“Budgets reflect priorities,” Batch said. “And this one, unfortunately, sends a loud, clear message about what my Republican colleagues care about: protecting the wealthy, ignoring working families, and leaving workers behind.”
Pay raises for teachers, state workers
The Senate Republicans’ budget would increase salaries for teachers, law enforcement and government workers over the next two years.
Educators would receive an average 2.3% pay increase next year, and an average 3.5% total increase over the next two years. They’ll also receive a $3,000 bonus over the next two years.
That would bring the average teacher salary in the state to $62,407, according to Berger.
Most state workers would see a 1.25% raise next year, as well as a $3,000 bonus over the next two years. That’s in addition to raises for correctional officers, probation and parole officers, state-funded nurses and other workers.
“This makes concerted efforts to target funds to areas with the most pressing workforce shortages,” Berger said.
Setting aside money for future Helene recovery
State lawmakers have thus far spent about $1.4 billion on recovery from Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina. Any future spending will likely come in a separate bill — but Senate Republicans would set aside another $700 million for future relief spending.
In the meantime, some money would flow to western colleges and Stein’s teams spearheading recovery efforts.
The state is facing major uncertainty on the federal level, with FEMA ending its cost-share and other programs and no new congressional spending on the horizon.
“We remain hopeful that the federal government will provide increased and expedited reimbursement,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell). “But we must be prepared to fend for ourselves.”
Income tax cuts continue, and pledge to cut ‘waste’
The governor has urged lawmakers to pause a series of planned cuts to the state’s income tax rate. He points to a joint forecast of legislative and executive branch economists who predict a shortfall in the coming years.
The Senate Republicans’ budget effectively doubles down on those tax cuts, guaranteeing they take effect in 2027 and 2028 and adding two more triggered cuts in years down the line.
Berger, who has been a leading advocate for the cuts, said Monday he was skeptical of the joint forecast, saying he had “rejected it in the past.” It was used to model this year’s budget, he said, but that he did not have confidence in its accuracy long-term.
“What we have seen is the state’s economy continuing to grow and flourish,” Berger said.
And echoing sentiments on the federal level, Berger said their budget would target “waste” within state government to curb unnecessary spending. He did not provide specifics Monday on what those eliminations might look like, besides a proposal to consolidate community colleges’ administration.
Much of it could come from eliminating long-empty jobs. The budget plan lays out workforce reductions in many departments and agencies that have struggled to chip away at a 20% vacancy rate. It’s not clear as of Monday evening whether those cuts could impact currently employed workers as well.
Health care, Rainy Day funds and DEQ
The Senate Republicans’ budget proposal also :

Requests the Department of Health & Human Services to add work requirements to Medicaid, and repeal “certificate of need” requirement for health care facilities.
Continues to fund NC Innovation, the private research nonprofit that has come under scrutiny by lawmakers, but changes the way it’s funded.
Sets out $638 million for a new children’s hospital in the Triangle. It would be funded through an ARPA fund and money transferred from NC Innovation to the UNC Board of Governors.
Replenishes the state’s “Rainy Day” reserves fund to $4.75 billion — its level before Hurricane Helene.
Orders a “comprehensive review” of academic programs across the UNC System.
Provides $110 million over two years to the Department of Environmental Quality to send grants for PFAS sampling and monitoring.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A highway closure Monday morning postponed a scheduled trip to the Pecos for members of New Mexico’s federal delegation, state and tribal officials, who instead gathered at Harry’s Roadhouse to discuss next moves in protecting the fragile Upper Pecos watershed from mining and logging.
Last week, all five members of the all-Democratic federal delegation reintroduced a bill to ban new mining activity in the Upper Pecos watershed, citing Source NM reporting that the new federal administration has reversed its plans to pursue such a ban.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration issued executive orders to increase logging and mining projects across the country. U.S.Sen. Martin Heinrich and Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, both of whom had announced plans to be in the Pecos area Monday, condemned the reversal in interviews with media Monday and noted that local and tribal governments, farming, ranching, acequias, conservation, hunting and fishing groups have called for added federal protections.
“When you have a process like this temporary mineral withdrawal just upended because somebody made a decision in Washington without speaking to anyone on the ground, I think that that should make us concerned for more decisions coming down the line,” Heinrich said.
Pueblo of Jemez 2nd Lt. Gov. Matthew Gachupin Jr., joined the delegation on Monday, as his pueblo has cultural ties to the area.
“The Pecos Watershed Protection Act is a tool we need now, it’s the weapon we need to fight this battle,” he said Monday. “We are in full support of this legislation and pray it will be successful.”
That being said, the Republican Party holds majorities in both chambers of Congress and will slow the bill’s progress, Leger Fernández said.
“We can’t tell you exactly when it will get heard,” she said. “What we are telling you is that if there is an opportunity to move it, to bring attention to the legislation, we will.”
Ralph Vigil, an organizer in Pecos for the nonprofit New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, as well as a member of the Stop Terrero Mine Coalition, said the group will continue to host meetings and river cleanups to keep the issue at the front of people’s minds.
“We have to keep getting people more involved in the community so we can really make a stand, if things go backwards,” Vigil said.
Much of the community opposition dates to the 1991 Terrero mining spill, when floodwaters breached a defunct mine and sent tailing sludge downriver, killing thousands of fish and buried Willow Creek. Cleanup remains ongoing and has cost tens of millions of dollars, including state environment officials’ request for $5.7 million from the Legislature this year.

Heinrich praised state efforts including a ban from the New Mexico State Land Commissioner and designating the Upper Pecos watershed a New Mexico “outstanding natural resource water,” which requires the state’s strictest water quality protections and offers some guardrails for the 200-some mining claims already existing in the region.
“When those designations went in place at the state level, they made it so that those mining claims — even if they are developed — do not have a right to put pollution in any of those tributaries,” Heinrich said. “So it really hems in how much damage could be done.”
Claresse Romero, the president of the San Miguel del Bado Land Grant, said the community will fight back harder, and will seek lawyers to fight new claims by Australian company New World Cobalt to do some exploratory drilling in the old Terrero mine and nearby deposits.
“I feel that our very lives are at stake,” Romero said in a phone call with Source NM. “Our health, the health of our community, the health of our ecosystem, the health of the farming communities, the health of our culture; because it ultimately is all under attack by these corporate means.”
Rep. Anita Gonzales (D-Las Vegas) who attended the impromptu gathering at Harry’s Roadhouse, told Source NM the state will work quickly to adopt a state program to take over regulating pollution in New Mexico’s surface waters — including from future mining — which was made possible by a law governor signed last week.
In the meantime, Gonzales said the local groups will lobby for the legislation to pass through Congress.
“We’ve done a good job of getting the support in place from the tribal governments, acequias, land grant governments, city, county and state. The next step is this federal protection,” Gonzales said. “We just have to hold the line long enough to where we’re able to pick up the momentum again, federally.”

John Gray/Verite News)Fourteen international students at Louisiana universities have had their permission to attend school in the United States revoked by the Trump administration.  
Seven Southern University students, three at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, two at the University of New Orleans and two more at Tulane University have had their visas pulled, according to representatives with the schools. 
 The Southern students had their visas revoked in early April, school spokeswoman Janene Tate said in a statement to the Illuminator. The university was not given a reason for their visas being revoked, she said. Tate said she could not disclose the students’ names or the exact dates the visas were revoked, citing the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
Marcus Jones, chief operating officer with the University of Louisiana System, confirmed the visa revocations at UL Lafayette and UNO. 
Tulane spokesman Mike Strecker said two international students had their visas terminated “based on prior criminal arrests unrelated to any protest activity.” 
The Trump administration has cracked down on international students they say have forfeited their right to be educated in the U.S., leaving hundreds at risk of deportation. 
Inside Higher Ed has identified more than 1,000 international students and recent graduates who have had their legal status suddenly changed. Attorneys for many of the students have alleged they were targeted for their speech. The Trump administration announced last week it would monitor immigrants’ social media for “antisemitism.” 
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last month the State Department had revoked more than 300 student visas from international students, many of whom engaged in pro-Palestine demonstrations that have swept college campuses.
The Trump administration has taken a hard line against universities where students have protested Israel in the nearly 18 months since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack in which some 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed and more than 250 people kidnapped. The incident kicked off a war between Israel and the extremist organization in which nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the United Nations, mostly women, children and elderly people. 
Trump and other Republicans have painted the largely peaceful protests — and support of Palestine in general — as antisemitic. His administration has threatened 60 universities, including Tulane, with the revocation of federal funding if they fail “to protect Jewish students on campus.”

Josh Shapiro’s official residence was held without bail after his first court appearance Monday afternoon.
Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg pleaded not guilty to eight counts, including attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. 
District Judge Dale Klein denied a request by Balmer’s attorney for reasonable bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released. Balmer is being held at the State Correctional Institue- Camp Hill in Cumberland County..
Balmer’s arraignment had been scheduled for earlier in the day Monday. But, it was postponed when he suffered a medical event not related to his arrest or the events of the night before, state police said.
He was brought to court after receiving treatment at an hospital wearing civilian clothes – blue jeans and an inside-out thermal shirt. Bald-headed, sunken-eyed and wearing a large beard, Balmer let out a long sigh after taking a seat in the courtroom and stared straight ahead waiting for the judge.
During the brief hearing in West Hanover Township outside Harrisburg, Balmer gave terse answers to Klein’s questions. Asked whether he suffered mental illness, he replied, “That’s the rumor, but no ma’am.”

Balmer also told the judge he has “a lot of children,” but refused to disclose how many and said he had been living with his parents for the last year. 
In charges filed Sunday, state police accused Balmer of scaling a fence at the governor’s residence in downtown Harrisburg and using Molotov cocktails to set fire to a ceremonial dining room where Shapiro had celebrated the first night of Passover with family and guests hours earlier.
In a news conference after Balmer turned himself in at state police headquarters in Harrisburg, Shapiro said he and his wife Lori were thankful to first responders and others who had offered support. He added that the attack would not prevent him from serving Pennsylvanians or proudly celebrating his Jewish faith.

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)The only difference between trial lawyers and insurance companies, Gov. Jeff Landry told state lawmakers Monday in his speech to open the 2025 legislative session, is that one wants to skin you from the ankle up and the other wants to skin you from the ear down. 
Landry’s stance that both sides are to blame puts him at odds with the historical approach his fellow Republicans have taken, which has largely put trial lawyers and their roadside billboards in their crosshairs. With his flashy statements, the governor teed up the fight over insurance legislation, which is certain to take center stage in the 59-day session. 
“The only thing worse than a little boy crying wolf is two little boys crying wolf,” Landry said, referring to trial attorneys and the insurance industry. 
 While no Republican lawmakers joined Landry’s staff in standing to cheer for his remarks about insurance, legislative leaders are not necessarily against his plan to hold both parties responsible. 
“It needs to be everybody,” House Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, said in an interview after the governor’s remarks. “I agree with that 100% because none of us are perfect, and certainly those two groups have room to be better.” 
Legislative Democrats seemed inclined to work with the governor. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Matt Willard, D-New Orleans, praised Landry for calling for legislation that would prohibit credit checks for setting insurance premiums. 
“This is a time to do right by the rate payers, by the people of Louisiana,” Willard said in a press conference after the speech.

Lawmakers will start debating insurance bills Tuesday, with the aim of getting the legislation approved as soon as possible. Lawmakers hope Landry will embrace the bills they send him. If not, their early passage could give them the opportunity to override his vetoes. 
Last year, Landry vetoed a highly anticipated, so-called “tort reform” bill that would have further capped damages an auto accident victim can seek from the insurance company of the driver at fault. Trial lawyers, who donated considerable amounts of money to Landry’s gubernatorial campaign, opposed the bill. 
Exiting his honeymoon period after 15 months in office – and on the heels of voters rejecting four of his priority constitutional amendments – Landry is now taking a tougher tone with the trial lawyers community that has largely supported him. 
“I am just as tired of seeing Morris Bart as I am of seeing the lizard,” Landry said at a news conference last week, referring to billboards and commercials from the New Orleans personal injury lawyer and the national insurance company Geico. 
Bart later hit back on social media. 
“Maybe I should learn how to hunt?!!” Bart wrote, referencing a turkey hunting trip to Texas that Landry took the week before with Gordon McKernan, one of Bart’s competitors, and several members of legislative leadership. Those gathered discussed insurance legislation, The Advocate reported. 
At the same time, Landry’s relationship with Commissioner of Insurance Tim Temple has declined, with the pair openly feuding. In an interview Monday, Temple was hesitant to criticize Landry but said he was looking forward to working on the insurance issue with Landry. 
While insurance prices will be the primary theme of the session, Landry also previewed his other legislative priorities for the year, including reorganizing the state Department of Transportation and Development, funding vouchers for private school and a list of “Make America Healthy Again” or MAHA bills. 
Landry’s proposal to provide more funding for private school vouchers through his LA GATOR program, one of his major legislative victories last year, faces an uphill battle. Lawmakers are also seeking money to keep teacher pay at last year’s level, which will require finding approximately $200 million. 
LA GATOR is supposed to cost the state $50 million this year, and some lawmakers are hesitant to fund private school tuition while cutting public school teachers’ pay. 
“Make America Healthy Again” is the slogan of President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime Landry ally. The governor and Kennedy are largely ideologically aligned, including on vaccine skepticism. 
Landry is backing Sen. Patrick McMath’s Senate Bill 14, which would ban “ultra-processed” foods in schools. Similar proposals are being considered or passed by other states. 
Several other bills are being touted as MAHA bills, but Landry has not yet taken a stance on them. They include proposals to remove fluoride from public water systems, to prohibit injecting chemicals into the sky to control the weather and creating the crime of “intentional exposure to a self-spreading pathogen.” 
While Willard commended Landry for wanting to make the population healthier, he emphasized the importance of making decisions based on science. 
“So encouraging exercise and healthy eating patterns, that’s great,” Willard said. “Removing fluoride from the water source and some of the other proposals out there, you know, major concerns.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill on Monday codifying a “Parents’ Bill of Rights” for West Virginians. The Republican-backed measure says, “The Legislature finds that it is a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, education, care and medical care of their minor children.”
More than 20 states — mostly red states — have similar legislation. 
“We’re just trying to make sure parents have the authority to raise their own kids here,” said bill sponsor Del. Jim Butler, R-Mason, when he presented the bill to House of Delegates members in February.
Jordan Carpenter, legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative nonprofit, praised the governor for signing the bill. He said the legislation will ensure parents remain free to guide the upbringing of their children.
“Parents love and know their child best, and they have the right and duty to direct the upbringing and care of their children,” Carpenter said. “In no world should the government intrude on parenting choices just because it disagrees with the parents.” 
House Bill 2129 includes language that a parent has a right to educate their child through homeschooling or in public and private school, and they can access and review all school records relating to his or her minor child. 
It also says parents have a right to make health care decisions for their child.
It does not apply to a parental action or decision that would end life, like a minor accessing an abortion. West Virginia has a near-total abortion ban that includes a narrow exception for rape and incest, including for minors who are victims of rape and incest and can currently access an abortion up to 14 weeks.
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, opposed the measure when the House Judiciary Committee vetted it in February.
“What I object to is carving out abortion based on the religious beliefs of some people in this Legislature, even though there are religions and parents who strongly disagree with that viewpoint,” he said. “If we’re going to pass a bill that preserves parental rights, for parents to decide about medical care for their minor children, we shouldn’t pick and choose.”
It also excludes a parent seeking to access gender-affirming care for their child because the state Legislature nearly banned that type of care, including gender reassignment surgeries, for minors in 2023. The ban included a narrow exemption for children who are diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria who are at risk of self harm and suicide, and Morrisey could sign a bill — passed by lawmakers on the final day of the legislative session — that would eliminate that carve out. Medical professionals warned lawmakers that it will lead to increased child suicide risk or death.
The bill does not authorize a parent to engage in child abuse or neglect, it says. 
While the legislation does not lay out any criminal penalties for entities that violate the law against parents, the measure can be used by parents in court as part of their defense in relevant cases. The bill will take effect in July.
The House passed a similar bill in 2024, but it wasn’t taken up by the Senate for consideration.

Six conservancies throughout the state will oversee work largely in Southern California and the Sierra Nevada.




Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed new legislation that will provide more than $170 million in state funding to help prevent wildfires while signing an order aimed at speeding up the work by easing environmental permitting.
The funding — which the Democratic governor said was part of a broader effort to better protect communities ahead of peak fire season — comes as the state is under extraordinary pressure after the January infernos that devastated Los Angeles communities. 
California has already experienced its second most destructive fire year on record, with more than 16,000 homes and other buildings damaged or destroyed by the two major fires in the Los Angeles area. Most of the destruction occurred in neighborhoods where development meets wildland, a high-risk area known as the wildland-urban interface.
The money comes from a $10 billion bond measure for environmental projects approved by California voters last year.Authorized as part of a fast-tracked, early action budget bill approved by the Legislature, the funds will be paid to six conservancies throughout California. The agencies, which operate under the governor’s Resources Agency, will manage the removal of vegetation and thinning of forests within their regions.
At least half, $85 million, will be directed to conservancies in Southern California, while $54 will focus on the Sierra Nevada. The approval of the funding comes after Newsom in March declared a state of emergency to clear flammable brush. 
“With this latest round of funding, we’re continuing to increase the speed and size of forest and vegetation management essential to protecting communities,” Newsom said in a written statement. “We are leaving no stone unturned — including cutting red tape — in our mission to ensure our neighborhoods are protected from destructive wildfires.”
The challenge of fire prevention in California, which experts say has been worsened by climate change, has become increasingly political. During President Donald J. Trump’s first term, the president repeatedly blamed wildfires on California failing to manage vegetation growth, even though the majority of forestland in the state is under federal, not state, ownership.
“You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests,” Trump said during a campaign speech in 2020, according to Politico. “There are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they’re like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up.”
In the wake of the Los Angeles fires, Trump also inaccurately blamed the state’s water policies for the blazes and threatened to withhold federal aid unless the state addressed a variety of policies related and unrelated to wildfires.
Included is about $31 million each for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, State Coastal Conservancy, and the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy. The California Tahoe Conservancy and the San Diego River Conservancy will receive about $23 million each.
In addition to the legislation, Newsom signed an executive order that allowed wildfire prevention projects to benefit from streamlining provisions outlined in his March emergency proclamation, which suspended certain environmental laws, including the California Environmental Quality Act and the California Coastal Act for projects deemed urgent.
“Unfortunately, this money will go toward logging projects that skirt environmental review and harm forests and the climate,” said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity. “This funding doubles down on forest destruction rather than investing in real wildfire safety measures like home hardening in communities.”
Newsom earlier this year promised $2.5 billion for various wildfire resilience projects. Prescribed burns, a land management tool designed to reduce fuel loads, are a major part of the state’s strategy.
Wildfire season is starting earlier and lasting longer, exacerbated by climate change. Altered cycles of dry and wet years build up vegetation that is vulnerable to fire, and California’s wildfires are acting more erratically and burning longer.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature will continue to meet every other year after the Senate on Monday defeated a bill to meet annually. 
House Bill 1408 called for shorter legislative sessions every year. It was seen by advocates as a way for North Dakota to be more nimble and to make it easier for more people to run for the Legislature, especially as the effects of the state’s term limits is expected to result in more turnover in the Legislature. 
Sen. Robert Erbele, R-Lehr, said he felt some legislators were overreacting to the effect of a term limits law passed in 2022. 
“Let’s see how it plays out,” Erbele said. 
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, noted that much of North Dakota’s tax revenue is reliant on ag and energy commodities that are influenced by global events. He said annual sessions would allow legislators to react to fluctuations more quickly. 
North Dakota is one of just four states where the Legislature does not meet every year. 
The House of Representatives passed the bill in February.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A lawsuit over the alleged defamation of a political candidate during the 2020 election has finally made its way to a jury trial.
On Monday, opening arguments were delivered in the case brought by a state legislative candidate, Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City, against the Nebraska Republican Party.

Palmtag, who lost the election to then State Sen. Julie Slama of Peru, has accused the GOP of defaming her by falsely stating, in political mailings, that Palmtag had broken the law in Iowa and had lost her real estate license in that state. Palmtag, who denies the allegations, is seeking damages for financial losses and emotional distress.
The case hinges on whether Nebraska GOP leaders acted with “actual malice” in making the claims, or whether it was an honest mistake during a heated political campaign that pitted two Republicans in a race for the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
The contest illustrated a split in the state party. Executives then running the Nebraska Republican Party, along with then-Gov. Pete Ricketts (who appointed Slama to her post) backed Slama, while Palmtag, a long-time Republican volunteer and real estate broker, had the support of former Gov. Dave Heineman and then-U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb.
Palmtag’s attorney, Dave Domina of Omaha, told jurors that it was “a case about words and the damage they can do” and that “democracy is not savagery.”
“We can’t get along in this country with the political extremes calling each other stupid things,” he said, pausing for effect. “You have a big role to play in that.”
Fight over facts
But the lead attorney for the state GOP, Kamron Hasan, told jurors there was insufficient evidence to prove by “clear and convincing evidence” (the standard in civil cases) that GOP officials had acted maliciously or with willful disregard for the truth.
“The evidence is going to show that the mailers … were not false,” Hasan said.
Instead, the attorney said, he would show that Ryan Hamilton, the executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party in 2020, had checked and doubled checked records of the Iowa Real Estate Commission before mailing two fliers in October 2020 that stated Palmtag had “broken the law and lost her real estate license” and was a “liberal” who was “irresponsible.”
  State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar. Oct. 28, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Domina repeatedly stated that Palmtag had never been disciplined for her work as a real estate broker or as owner of her real estate brokerage, J.J. Palmtag, Inc., which operated in Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa.
In 2018, he said that Palmtag agreed to pay a $500 fine as part of a “consent” agreement with the Iowa Real Estate Commission to settle a mistake made by one of her agents, who was gravely ill from cancer. The settlement, over the 2017 sale of a home in Thurman, Iowa, made no admission of a law violation, Domina said, and did not result in her losing her real estate license.
“(Her license) was not suspended, it wasn’t revoked. To say that is a lie,” he said during his opening statement.
Domina, one of the state’s most prominent lawyers and a one-time Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, said Hamilton, the State GOP executive director, had “giggled” when Palmtag asked him to retract and correct the claims.
But Hasan told jurors that Hamilton had looked up the Iowa Real Estate Commission’s settlement with J.J. Palmtag Inc., which was signed by Janet Palmtag. It stated that her firm “did not contest the alleged violation” of state laws pertaining to such financial transfers, he said.
Hasan told jurors that Hamilton had also checked the status of the Palmtag firm’s Iowa license, and it indicated that it had been “cancelled.”
“These (records) are accurate. This is true,” the GOP attorney said.
A ‘vicious time’
While Domina portrayed Palmtag’s campaign in 2020 as fairly passive after she was roundly out-polled by Slama in the 2020 primary, Hasan called it a “bitter” contest at a “vicious time” in politics during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There was negativity. There was hostility,” Hasan said.
When called to testify, Palmtag told jurors she had no role in the sale of the Iowa home and had only learned later, via a routine audit by the Iowa commission, that the permission to transfer a $5,000 earnest deposit on the sale had been signed by only the seller and not also the buyer. Both signatures are required in Iowa.

“I did pay a $500 fine for Dale,” Palmtag testified, referring to her agent, Dale Rogers, who has since died.
She also testified that she had voluntarily taken “inactive” status as an Iowa real estate broker and voluntarily “cancelled” her company’s Iowa license in the wake of devastating floods along the Missouri River in Iowa during 2019 because the floods had ruined the market there.
The case took so long to get to trial, in large part, because of an appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court. The trial judge, Lancaster County District Court Judge Andrew Jacobsen, had initially dismissed the case, agreeing with the Nebraska GOP that Palmtag had failed to show that the party had acted with actual malice.
But, after Palmtag appealed, the State Supreme Court ruled last year that a jury, and not the judge, should decide if there was a “genuine issue” of malice. That ruling sent the case back to Jacobsen for trial. The trial is expected to continue most of this week.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate on Monday passed a bill that backers say ensures farmers in the state will have access to needed ag chemicals, while protesters outside the Capitol lobbied against legal protections for pesticide manufacturers.  
House Bill 1318, which is similar to legislation being considered in several other states, passed on a vote of 29-18. The bill was amended and will return to the House, which had previously given the bill unanimous approval. 
Much of the discussion on the bill has centered on the product Roundup, produced by the German company Bayer. Bayer has been hit with several lawsuits alleging that Roundup causes cancer even though the Environmental Protection Agency has not determined that the herbicide causes cancer. 
  Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said the bill confirms that “the label is the law” and that a court ruling can’t lead to the product being pulled from the market. A California case threatened to temporarily pull Roundup from the market in some western states.    
The bill says that the EPA label provides adequate warning to the hazards of the product and shields manufacturers from lawsuits if the product is labeled and manufactured property. 
Myrdal and other supporters referred to “frivolous lawsuits.” 
Bayer has been ordered to pay billions of dollars to people who have successfully filed lawsuits claiming they have been harmed by Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate. 
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, one of the opponents of the bill, said he understands farmers want to use pesticides, but he feared they will regret the bill should a product later be found to cause health problems. 
“Farmers themselves are giving up some protection,” Mathern said. “Don’t give it away.” 
The bill spurred a small protest in front of the Capitol before the vote. 
Sam Wagner, who focuses on ag issues for the Dakota Resource Council and helped organize the protest,  said the group wanted to make sure North Dakota citizens have a “fair shot” if they challenge prominent pesticide makers in court.
“(The bill) isn’t going to stop them from filing a lawsuit,” Wagner said. “It’s just going to make the bar so high.”

He said the national group Modern Ag Alliance is trying to get similar bills passed in other states to insulate ag chemical companies from liability.
Charlene Nelson of Casselton said the bill would strip away a fundamental right of people to use  the court system if they feel wronged.
“If this passes, it will be almost impossible for someone to win a case,” Nelson said.
While the focus of discussion has been on Roundup, she noted that there are about 16,000 different chemicals registered for use with the North Dakota Department of Agriculture.
  Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, on April 15, 2025, spoke in favor of a bill that protects availability of pesticides to North Dakota farmers. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)
“We don’t know what the full effects of all of those are,” Nelson said. “What if five, six, 10 years down the road, we find out that they really are dangerous? We will have no way to recover the losses or the damages that those incur.”
Other arguments in favor of the bill included helping ensure that Bayer and other manufacturers would not pull out of the U.S. market because of the product liability claim, and that it would encourage further research and development of ag chemicals. 
Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, said without protections for the chemical industry, “any new investment would be chilled.”

Montana University System officials last week announced that four foreign students had their F-1 visas[...]","Montana State University welcomes students back to campus for the first day of the Fall 2023 semester. (Provided by Montana State University)Two graduate students at Montana State University are asking a federal court to stop the Trump administration and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from terminating their foreign student status, which could allow officials to immediately deport them.
Montana University System officials last week announced that four foreign students had their F-1 visas revoked and their F-1 statuses cancelled, meaning they could be subject to immediate deportation. Their cases mirrored hundreds of other cases across the United States.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Montana filed the motion in court on Monday on behalf of two of the four students. Laywers said that both students were sent identical form letters which said their status had been revoked because of criminal status, although neither has been convicted or charged with any crime, leading to confusion and panic.
The identity and status of the other two students mentioned by MSU are not publicly known.
The Department of Homeland Security has not just revoked the F-1 visa, which is a document that allows a student entry into the United States, it has apparently wiped out their F-1 status, which allows a student to remain lawfully and allows them to be employed in certain jobs, like teaching assistant positions or research. By cancelling the status, the lawsuit argues, the Trump administration has made it impossible for the students to keep employment or be paid.
The lawsuit also points out that cancelling a F-1 visa is not necessarily cause to revoke the student’s entire status. The ACLU of Montana says the actions of the Trump administration violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of due process, which extends to residents who are not U.S. citizens, but still lawfully in the country, like the students.
According to court documents, neither student has been convicted of a crime, and neither student has participated in protests or demonstrations.
The court documents also shed light into the inner workings of the moves by the Trump officials to boot foreign-born students. For example, officials did not appear to give either the students or the universities any advance warning. The four students in Montana learned of the changed status after officials with the university system were doing a routine check of the database on April 10.
It is unknown when the change was made, and the lawsuit said the university system officials have had no communication explaining the status change. However, with both the F-1 visa and the F-1 status being changed, the court filing said there’s little to stop an immediate deportation, and officials worry about due process rights being protected.
“This policy appears to be primarily targeting African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim and Asian students,” the court brief said.
The court filings say that both students fear that years of work and research could be abruptly ended with the decision.
The ACLU has asked for “emergency relief” for the two unnamed students so that they couldn’t be immediately deported, and to have their status restored. Moreover, the lawsuit asks federal court Judge Dana Christensen to prohibit the administration from arresting, detaining or transferring the students from beyond the Montana federal court’s jurisdiction without providing adequate notice to contest any action.
Students who come to the U.S. under a F-1 status must maintain a full course of study, and have limited options for income, usually related to that field of study. One of the MSU students is a doctoral student in electrical engineering and physics, with a completion date around December, 2025.
“He has never been convicted of a crime in the United States or elsewhere,” the court filing said. “He does not understand why his visa was revoked and his (foreign student) record was terminated. Neither the government nor MSU has provided any additional details or explanation for the change in (his) status or the revocation of his F-1 visa.”
In addition to placing his entire doctorate in jeopardy, the student’s sister is a graduate student at the University of Colorado. He financially supports her, and according to the lawsuit, the sudden status change has threatened both of their ability to support themselves.
The second graduate student from MSU is studying microbiology, and she has never been convicted of a crime in Montana or her native country.
“This has placed her in an extremely difficult financial and academic position, as her teaching assistantship is not only her only source of income, but also a core component of her master’s training,” the suit said.
In addition to violating the Administrative Procedures Act, the lawsuit said, terminating their status already violated the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.
“Plaintiffs were not afforded the most basic of notice nor opportunity to heard that was owed to them before having their F-1 student status terminated,” the lawsuit said. “The letter did not include any further information as to why (their) F-1 status had been revoked, or how they might seek further information about their specific situations, or even of any available procedures they could follow to challenge the termination.”
The court filing also says that without the federal court taking immediate, emergency action, the students will continue to be at risk, not just of deportation and financial hardship, but that they will have their study interrupted unfairly.
“(Their) due process rights are being impaired,” the court filing said. “(They) face the imminent risk — indeed, likelihood — that they will be unable to complete their graduate studies, that they will be unable to earn an income, and support their families,” the suit said. “(They) also current face the serious risk of immediate arrest and detention for deportation because they no longer have lawful status to remain in the United States.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MSU-enrollment-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 19:04:03.326357

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)It’s out with the new and in with the old again for students in South Dakota’s English and Language Arts classrooms. 
The South Dakota Board of Education Standards approved revisions to the English and language arts state standards Monday in Rapid City, aligning them with a once-abandoned instructional approach in hopes of improving students’ declining reading scores.
The revision follows a global debate — often called the “reading wars” — about how best to teach children to read. One side advocates for phonics, which focuses on the relationship between sounds and letters. The other prefers a “whole language” approach that puts a stronger emphasis on meaning, with some phonics mixed in. A phonics-based approach was widely used in the 20th century until a “balanced literacy” approach that includes phonics but favors whole language gained favor in the 2000s.
Noem’s phonics literacy effort advances in Legislature

Low reading scores in recent years led to a push to reconsider the merits of the phonics-based “science of reading” methodology. 
Just under 50% of South Dakota students didn’t meet English and language arts standards last year, according to the state report card.
School district credits science of reading for 50-point jump in proficiency
Studies in recent years have re-ignited interest in phonics as a learning tool, and one South Dakota school district presented results Monday that suggest it can work. 
Douglas School District leaders presented the district’s increased literacy rates since implementing science of reading curriculum district-wide in 2021. 
Fifty-five percent of Douglas elementary students in the spring of 2019 did not meet expected standards for reading ability, according to district student assessments. The district made systemic changes, such as hiring instructional coaches and allowing all students to apply for Title I interventions, in addition to implementing science of reading methodology. 
In the same year the district implemented the science of reading strategy, rates above expected standards increased to 64% of students. That grew to 72% district-wide by the spring of 2024.


“Our teachers are working tirelessly to meet the needs of all students, and this success doesn’t happen overnight,” said Ann Pettit, Douglas executive director of elementary curriculum and instruction.
Board of Education Standards Board President Steve Perkins said the data shows “things can be done” to address English and language arts proficiencies in the state.
The state put $6 million toward training teachers in phonics during the 2024 state legislative session. Part of the funding will go toward courses to train teachers in phonics-based teaching methods, and some will be used to pay for a literacy conference on Science of Reading strategies.
A $54 million Comprehensive Literacy State Development federal grant awarded, meanwhile, is set to help local school districts implement a phonics-based approach over the next five years. The grants will be awarded based on the number of low-income students in a district, and can be used for literacy coach salaries, teacher training or curriculum reviews.
On Monday, Perkins said the changed standards are a “big deal.”
“If kids can’t read — or don’t read to standard is a better way to put it — then we’re shortchanging them,” Perkins said.
The unanimous vote came after a fourth public hearing on the standards. 
Board approved Indigenous content standards despite opposition
Board members also approved optional content standards for computer science and the Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings, which educate students on the culture and traditions of Indigenous South Dakotans.
Survey says nearly two-thirds of SD educators use Indigenous standards

Several opponents with connections to South Dakota’s tribal nations borders spoke against the Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings revisions.
Opponents criticized the underrepresentation of Dakota and Nakota tribes in the revised standards, and said there should  be a more concerted effort to involve tribes.
“The problem with this process is it was conducted without meaningful, reciprocal, formal tribal consultation,” said Sarah White, founder and executive director of the South Dakota Education Equity Coalition.
White and others asked the board to hold off and reach out to tribal government leaders. But board members unanimously approved the revisions.
South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves told board members the revision “was not a rushed process,” and incorporated opinions from a 34-member review committee, as well as tribal education leaders on the Indian Education Advisory Committee.
Perkins told opponents before casting his vote that the changes move the state in the “right direction.” He added that he takes direction from Gov. Larry Rhoden to press “reset” on tribal-state communications.
“What I hear is that what we may have isn’t perfect, and we clearly need to work harder on communication,” Perkins said.
The standards will be available for use by the South Dakota teachers who choose to teach them in fall 2026.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Federal layoffs have hampered the city of Milwaukee’s ability to respond to growing concerns about lead contamination in Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) denied the city’s requests for assistance after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut the agency’s response team, which would have helped Milwaukee tackle lead contamination in its K-12 schools. 
“This is a pretty unprecedented scenario to not have somebody to turn to at the CDC,” said Mike Totoraitis, commissioner of the Milwaukee Health Department (MHD), during a Monday press conference. Totoratis learned of the development, which he said left him “quite shocked,” in an email as the Health Department was planning further responses to lead contamination in MPS. “To see that all of our partners at the CDC had been let go was pretty…pretty difficult,” he said.
Although a local network of partners will continue supporting MHD’s efforts, Totoraitis said that the department now has no CDC contacts to consult with on  childhood lead poisoning. The commissioner called it “a pretty stark moment for us at the department to not have someone to reach out to federally.” 
In February the Health Department began reaching out to the CDC as staff members realized the scale of the lead problem e in MPS buildings. Totoraitis said the department might have to assess the school district’s 68,000 students and over 100 school buildings. 
The CDC initially connected the city to specialists at the National Center for Environmental Health’s childhood lead prevention program. City health officials had hoped national teams would help investigate potential lead exposure cases and help with evaluating which schools were likely to have the worst problems.
Totoraitis explained that while there are acute exposures to lead — such as ingesting paint chips — chronic exposure from dust was paint degrades over  time is also a hazard. 
With closer analysis, the health department would be able to learn more about how children in Milwaukee are getting exposed to lead, including whether they’re exposed at school or at home. 
CDC was expected to send three to four people to Milwaukee for up to five weeks, he said, as well as provide technical assistance from individuals advising the department remotely from Atlanta. 
“That’s why we engaged them right away,” said Totoraitis. He described the team as “the top experts in the field for lead exposure,” with experience dealing with lead hazards at a much wider scale than local experts in Milwaukee.
There was “no indication” that the CDC teams would be let go, said Totoraitis. “So that was pretty startling,” he added. Preparation to deploy the teams was underway when the CDC abruptly canceled “overnight” on April 1. 
So far, nearly 250 MPS students have been tested for lead poisoning and several schools have been shut down as work crews undertake remediation efforts. 
In early April, MPS announced that it was separating with its facilities director Sean Kane, who’d been with the district for 25 years. Officials said Kane had not allowed health department staff into Golda Meir School to do a full risk assessment and did not disclose that remediation work had been attempted after a student tested positive for lead contamination. 
Childhood lead contamination has been linked to cognitive disorders including degraded impulse control, learning disabilities and violent behavior. About 85 MPS schools were built before 1970 and are therefore at high risks of lead contamination. 
Totoraitis said that so far, there isn’t a timeline on when MPS schools that have been closed due to lead will reopen. Fernwood Montessori School, Starms Early Childhood Center and LaFollette School were closed, while four others that had been closed were re-opened. 
Totoraitis said that remediation work is farthest along at Fernwood, which is beginning its fifth week of closure. Fernwood was “significantly worse off” than investigators anticipated and required extensive repair work, he said. 
As the city works to respond to the lead issue, federal staff and the unpredictability of federal assistance will remain a challenge. Just a couple of weeks ago, the city lost $11 million in COVID-19 grants that were geared towards “recovery” rather than “response,”  officials said.
“The part that’s really concerning for us is there hasn’t been any communication warning us of these changes and shifts in personnel,” said Totoraitis. “April 1 is a really stark moment for public health here across the country, and specifically here in Milwaukee, where now we don’t know who to call. We don’t know how to respond to some of the challenges that we’re dealing with right now because we don’t know if I’m reaching out to someone today, if they’re going to be there tomorrow.”
Totoraitis said the Health Department and its local partners stand ready to respond, but he questioned what could happen if the department encounters a complex challenge, such as a particularly complicated blood screening data.  
“The CDC brings that expertise, that bigger picture, that we just don’t have eyes to because we’re here focused on an issue in Milwaukee,” said Totoraitis.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee’s cost-saving proposal to move Rhode Island’s minimum security inmates into a segregated building within the state prison’s medium security by next January has been dropped because of projected high costs.
The governor’s recommended budget asked the General Assembly to allocate $1 million to close its mostly empty minimum security facility by the start of 2026. McKee’s administration projected an annual savings of $12.7 million for the state starting fiscal year 2027, reducing per-inmate cost by more than $40,000.
But a feasibility study conducted by Miami-based CGL Companies for the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) found that the work needed to conduct such a move would cost the state between $67 million to $71 million.
CGL’s report notes “Extensive modifications” would have to be made including new fencing, a new sally port at the rear of a new minimum security building, administrative spaces, along with more toilets and showers. 
The new minimum security facility would have had  capacity for 192 inmates and no room to add beds should the state need to expand. The existing minimum security building, which is now at 19% of capacity, can house up to 710 inmates.
McKee’s office deferred comment on the scrapped plan to the Department of Corrections.
“The initial estimate was made prior to the completion of the feasibility study, and it was always contingent on the findings of the study,” Department of Corrections spokesperson J.R. Ventura said in an email.
Findings from the study were presented before the House Finance Subcommittee on Public Safety last week as part of its annual look at department budgets.
“A direct housing transfer was just not feasible,” Assistant Director Brenda Brodeur told the committee.
Bordeur said prison officials will now look to find budget savings through reductions in overtime spending, which the Department of Corrections has increased in recent years due to triple-digit vacancies.
A presentation to the subcommittee from House Fiscal Office staff notes that the state’s prison had 117 open positions as of March 22, which is expected to cost the state $42.9 million in overtime expenses by the end of the fiscal year.
There are 72 correctional officer vacancies.
McKee’s latest tax-and-spend plan assumes $36.8 million will go toward overtime expenses in the fiscal year starting July 1.
The governor’s proposal to consolidate the state’s minimum and medium security facilities quickly drew ire from the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, whose members nearly picketed one of McKee’s fundraisers in February.
RIBCO called off its protest after its members had “a series of productive meetings” over officers’ concerns.
Union president Richard Ferruccio wrote to the subcommittee that the officers are thankful to see the consolidation proposal scrapped, but wary of plans to reduce overtime spending.
“Staff and post reductions during a time of increased disciplinary problems and record drug problems is a recipe for disaster,” he wrote.
DOC Director Wayne Salisbury Jr. had sought to hire 150 more staffers under his proposal to the governor, but McKee opted to keep the department’s staffing at current levels.

(Photo by Darwin Brandis/iStock Getty Images Plus)A Senate subcommittee moved forward a bill Monday allocating $42 million from the Opioid Settlement Fund to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to combat the impacts of the opioid crisis.
Senate Study Bill 1226 would provide a $12 million grant for Community and Family Resources, an addiction recovery and treatment center in Fort Dodge and $30 million to Iowa HHS for efforts to “abate the opioid crisis in the state,” taking into account recommendations from the seven district behavioral health advisory councils throughout the state.
Moving forward, the bill states 75% of unobligated money from the settlement fund will go to HHS and 25% will go to the Attorney General’s office, to be disbursed “in accordance with the requirements of the master settlement agreements.” Each year, the two entities will have to submit their recommendations on appropriating the funds for the next fiscal year to lawmakers as a bill, again with consideration for regional behavioral health advisory council recommendations.

Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, said this bill will not necessarily be the final version of the legislation, but that he wanted to get the conversation started early to ensure that opioid settlement funding is distributed.
“We’ve been in negotiations a little bit with the House,” Kraayenbrink said. “And I just think, rather than holding on and waiting for additional negotiations, we need to get a bill (moved) … and hopefully come to a resolution on what’s going to happen.”
There is currently more than $56 million in Iowa’s Opioid Settlement Fund, received as settlement in lawsuits brought by states against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies for their roles in the opioid epidemic. Iowa will receive more than $325 million from these settlements between fiscal years 2021 through 2039, according to the AG’s office. The funds are split, with half going to local governments and half to the state — with both levels of government obligated to use at least 85% of the funds received for opioid addiction treatment and prevention services.
Lawmakers set up the Opioid Settlement Fund in 2022 to collect and distribute this money given to the state. However, the Legislature has not dispersed any of the fund’s money in the past two sessions — disagreements between the House and Senate on how to allocate these funds were not resolved before the session ended in 2024.

The House had moved in 2024 to designate money to go to specific nonprofits — $3 million to Youth and Shelter Services and $8 million to Community and Family Resources. In the Senate proposal this year, $12 million was allocated for Community and Family Resources. Executive Director Michelle De La Riva told lawmakers at the subcommittee meeting the funding would go toward a new campus providing resources like a detox program and adolescent residential program.
When asked if other programs could be given direct funding in the 2025 bill, Kraayenbrink said more allocations could be made as negotiations occur between the two chambers.
“I don’t know if I really see it being exactly like this when it’s done, but this is just to get the momentum going,” he said.
Amy Campbell with the Iowa Behavioral Health Association praised the measure for including input from the district behavioral health advisory councils in the distribution of the funds. She said these councils will be able to see funding needs in their communities as disbursement begins from local governments and through the state.
“We think one of the good parts of this bill is actually getting that local input from the regional advisory board, since they will be on the ground and they’re going to start seeing the gaps as the new system kind of comes online,” Campbell said. “And I think they’re in a good spot to be able to provide advice on that.”
The House had offered an amendment creating a grant program for settlement funds through HHS in addition to establishing an advisory council to oversee and make recommendations about funding these grants each year. The advisory council was not approved by the Senate, leaving the settlement funds undistributed last year. Kraayenbrink said he was not sure if House members would pursue this oversight component again, but said he wanted to ensure that negotiations begin on the Opioid Settlement Fund.
“I just felt, from a prudent standpoint of the Senate, is that I just can’t sit and watch nothing happen again,” Kraayenbrink said. “It’s time that we at least move, and kind of force the conversation to be had.”
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said she supported starting the conversation on the settlement fund.
“I’m glad to see that we have this bill before us, because Iowans have been waiting too long with this money stuck in the freezer,” Petersen said. “… These dollars need to be getting out the door to help Iowans. We lost over 1,000 Iowans in the past five years, and we know people are struggling.”
The bill moves to the Senate Appropriations Committee for further consideration.

(File/Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Hundreds of 4-year-olds across South Carolina are on waitlists to access state-funded preschool programs, even though there are thousands of open seats, according to a report presented Monday to the state Education Oversight Committee.
The state funds a dual system of full-day kindergarten for 4-year-olds deemed “at risk.” Students are eligible under state law if they qualify for Medicaid or free or reduced-price meals, or if they are homeless, in foster care or show developmental delays. Many public school districts use local property tax dollars to expand that eligibility.
The state Department of Education oversees programs in public schools, while First Steps, a separate state agency, oversees state-funded classes in approved private schools and child care centers.
As of November, 400 4-year-olds were waiting for spots to open up to enroll at their local public school. At the same time, First Steps 4K reported more than 2,300 open seats, often in the same counties as the districts with the longest waitlists, according to the report.
“It’s just a matter of finding an open seat for a child on a waitlist or finding an eligible child for the open seat,” said Jenny May, a committee researcher who presented the report.
When ‘universal’ pre-K really isn’t: Barriers to participating abound

Because 4K is a one-year program, students who are on the waitlist are unlikely to end up in a preschool program before starting kindergarten. Children need at least 120 days of preschool to prepare, so even if a slot happens to open up toward the end of the school year, they will start kindergarten less ready than other 5-year-olds, according to the study.
It’s not clear why some 4-year-olds are on a waiting list for a public school when vacancies exist in private programs, May said.
In some cases, the issue could be that another preschool program isn’t available nearby. The four counties with the longest waitlists — Lexington, Anderson, Berkeley and Newberry — all have at least one First Steps 4K program with availability, according to the report. However, that doesn’t account for potential cross-county drives.
Other parents may not know that other options are available, May said. Having a person designated to help direct parents to other preschool options, such as the nearest First Steps 4K program with open seats, could help reduce that waitlist, May said.
“It’s likely that if we had a more efficient process, we could serve most of the 400 kids on a waitlist on one of the First Steps seats,” May said.
The state already has several websites meant to help parents figure out what programs they’re eligible for and how to enroll. Palmetto Pre-K, launched in 2020, tells parents whether they’re eligible for state-funded preschool programs. First Five SC does the same but includes all early childhood programs with federal or state funding.
But having a person parents can call, or who can reach out to families with children on waitlists, could help reach some parents who might not know about the websites or have other concerns, the study suggests. That person, who the committee dubbed a 4K navigator, could then talk parents through the differences in programs, find available seats and answer any other questions parents might have, researchers said.
First Steps 4K has a similar program, in which applicants are directed to a central phone line or website that helps parents find the right fit for their child. That has helped prevent First Steps from having its own waitlist, May said. The 4K navigators, who the study suggested trying out in areas with the largest waitlists first, would have a broader knowledge of pre-K programs, the report said.
Hundreds of SC preschoolers suspended each year for offenses like hitting, spitting

If a school district has a persistent waitlist of more than 20 students, that suggests the population has risen in that area, and state officials should consider giving the district more funding to create enough slots for those students, the report suggested.
The waitlisted students represent less than 1% of students who are eligible for the program but not enrolled. More than 18,000 4-year-olds, or about 55% of all eligible, are living in poverty but not enrolled in a 4K program, according to the report.
That’s a decrease from the 2022-2024 school year, when 60% of eligible students were not enrolled in districts. Still, it’s not enough, May said.
Even if every student on a waitlist enrolled in one of the available spots, programs would have space left over to take on at least 1,900 more students, according to the report. That suggests there are barriers other than program space keeping parents from enrolling their students in state-funded preschool, May said.
In many cases, the problem might be that parents don’t know about 4K programs or their benefits, May said. The state should put more funding and effort into outreach to help those students, the report suggests.
Data shows preschool programs are highly beneficial, helping students learn skills in reading, math and socialization, studies have found. According to the report, at-risk students who attended a state-funded pre-K program were more likely to be prepared for school than their counterparts who didn’t, according to the report.
“So, we want those students who are eligible and not served to be able to access it, and we definitely want those students who are on a waitlist to be able to access the program,” said Dana Yow, executive director of the committee.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/admin-ajax.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 19:04:03.326357

Getty ImagesFive international college students and two recent graduates studying in Georgia have filed suit against the administration of President Donald Trump after attorneys say the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unlawfully terminated the immigration records allowing them to keep studying in the United States.
Many of the students believe the actions were taken against them because of past run-ins with law enforcement, mostly over traffic citations, some of which were ultimately dropped, according to the lawsuit.
Unless the U.S. District Court of North Georgia puts a temporary block on the government while the case moves forward, the students could be subject to arrest, detention and deportation in addition to loss of academic standing and degrees.
The termination of the students’ SEVIS, or Student and Exchange Visitor Program, records comes as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration, targeting student visa holders in the country legally for “self-deportation.”
“Over the past week, visa revocations and SEVIS terminations have shaken campuses across the country and Georgia,” the lawsuit reads.
“ICE has created chaos as schools have attempted to understand what is happening and do their best to inform and advise students.”
The lawsuit names Attorney General Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons as defendants.
The Georgia students, who came to the U.S. from Colombia, China and India, studied at schools including Kennesaw State University, Georgia Tech, Emory University and the University of Georgia. They filed suit along with 10 other students from various other universities including Duke University, North Carolina State University and Cornell University, all under the name Jane or John Doe, citing fear of retaliation from the administration.
The students facing deportation include doctoral students, recent graduates completing optional post-graduate work and a student-athlete with a 4.0 GPA, according to the lawsuit.
One of the students was arrested and charged with domestic violence in November, but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence in February, according to the lawsuit. Other cases involved expired license plates or tags or speeding. Another involved a DUI charge that was reduced to reckless driving. One Chinese national who studied electrical and electronics engineering said she was never arrested or cited for any traffic violations.
The attorneys for the students and alumni argue that the student’s alleged actions do not meet the legal threshold for revoking their SEVIS registration and that the government’s actions violate their due process protections under the Fifth Amendment.

Gabe Vasquez called militarizing the U.S.-Mexico border ""misguided and wasteful,"" following President Trump's orders last week for a military buffer zone. (Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-New Mexico) on Monday called militarizing the U.S.-Mexico border “misguided and wasteful,” following President Donald Trump’s direction late last week authorizing a military buffer zone stretching from California to New Mexico.
Creating that zone would mean migrants crossing the border into the U.S. would be trespassing on a military base and could then be held by military personnel and transferred into the custody of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, members of the military having direct contact with migrants could be a violation of federal law.
“Deploying military assets to the border, during a record time of low crossing numbers, is a misguided and wasteful use of military resources and taxpayer dollars,” Vasquez, who represents border towns in New Mexico’s 2nd congressional district, told Source NM in a written statement. “As a lifelong border resident who has spent years working with border stakeholders, I can tell you that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work—and in some places, including parts of New Mexico’s Bootheel, this kind of made-for-TV stunt does little to nothing to solve our nation’s broken immigration system.”
The strip of land Trump directed the military to occupy is known as the Roosevelt Reservation and stretches from the southwestern edge of California through southern Arizona and ends at New Mexico’s border with Mexico and Texas, near El Paso. The zone also stretches 60 feet north of the border.
Vasquez told Source that investments in border security should be “strategic” and beneficial to border communities, the economy and the country as a whole.
“Militarizing the Roosevelt Reservation won’t solve the humanitarian crisis or improve public safety, it will take warfighters away from real national security threats like Russia and China,” Vasquez wrote.
Vasquez was among 48 members of Congress who last week signed onto a letter by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida) calling for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to reinstate several immigration oversight offices that were closed in late March. The offices include the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman; the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties; and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, all of which are required by Congress and advocate for the humane treatment of migrants in federal custody.
“The closure of these offices raises serious questions about DHS’s transparency and compliance with the law,” the letter states. “This will have impacts far beyond detention: it will cut off avenues for the public to file complaints about DHS policies and practices from airport screenings to ICE raids against schools, hospitals, and religious centers.”
In a statement last week, Vasquez called the closure of the oversight offices; potential violations of due process against people in custody; and unsanitary detention conditions “un-American.”

(Photo by Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal, via press pool)A judge has entered a restraining order barring Glenna Bevin from any contact with her adopted son, Jonah Bevin, following his request that his adoptive parents, former Gov. Matt Bevin and Glenna Bevin, be ordered to have no contact with him.
Matt Bevin already is subject to a six-month protective order barring him from any communication or contact with Jonah, who has alleged the Bevins abandoned him at age 17 in a brutally abusive youth facility in Jamaica.
Now 18, Jonah appeared in court last month, seeking orders to protect him from the Bevins — who are now divorced — alleging they tried to get him out of the country by hastily arranging a trip to Ethiopia where they claimed they had located his birth mother.

Jonah says in a court filing he believes they were trying to “get me to disappear.”
Neither Matt nor Glenna Bevin has responded to requests for comment.
Dawn J. Post, a lawyer representing Jonah, said she has been unable to verify the existence of a mother in Ethiopia whom Jonah had been told was dead since his adoption by the Bevins at age 5. He was one of four children the couple adopted from Ethiopia in 2012; they also have five biological children, all adults except one.
Post said Jonah is eager to learn any information about his mother or other relatives but her independent inquiry has not identified any proof they exist.
“We are going to pursue our own search,” she said. “It is still very important to him.”
The protective order issued Monday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Angela Johnson gives the Bevins seven days to provide all information in their possession about Jonah’s adoption and his biological family.
Meanwhile, another hearing in the case is scheduled April 21 on whether to seal the Bevins proposed divorce settlement. In a court filing last month, the couple reported to the judge they had reached a settlement but wanted it kept confidential and out of the public record to protect their privacy.
The Courier Journal and Jonah have both filed motions asking that it remain public. The media company argues the case is of public interest and Jonah argues he needs to know the information to be able to protect his interest, since he has had no support from his adoptive parents.
He also has alleged he experienced abuse and neglect in the Bevins’ home.
“At present, no one who has Jonah’s interest is involved in the litigation,” said the motion filed by Louisville lawyers John Helmers Jr. and Melina Hettiaratchi. “Jonah’s best guess is that his parents never revealed their abuse and neglect of him to this court, including their failure to meet his basic needs and to provide a safe home and a complete education as required by law.”

(Provided, South Bow)The Keystone Pipeline resumed operations Monday at a reduced pressure as cleanup efforts continue from an oil spill in North Dakota.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said it approved operator South Bow’s plan to restart the pipeline, after a corrective action order issued by the federal regulators.
The company shut down the Keystone Pipeline on April 8 after a drop in pressure. South Bow later estimated that about 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons, of oil spilled in a farm field near Fort Ransom. The spill was contained to the field.
The failed section of pipe was excavated and replaced, according to a statement from PHMSA. The failed section will be sent to Houston for testing.

South Bow in a statement described it as a “carefully controlled restart” of the pipeline. The repaired line will be tested at various pressures, regulators said.
The Keystone Pipeline carries Canadian oil through the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba then south through the Midwest. 
Regulators remained at the spill site and planned to continue monitoring the operator’s compliance.
As of Friday, an estimated 1,170 barrels, or 49,140 gallons, of oil had been recovered by five vacuum trucks.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Supporters of a Colorado bill that would set standards for how social media companies respond to users who violate a platform’s illegal sales policy are urging Gov. Jared Polis to sign the legislation.
Senate Bill 25-86 passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan support, but sponsors fear Polis, a Democrat, will veto it based on First Amendment concerns.
“This bill simply says that for users egregiously harming our kids, they cannot be given endless chances to continue victimizing others. If this kind of conduct that we see on these social media platforms was happening on the street, there would be no question about intervention. None,” Sen. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican and bill sponsor, said at a press conference Monday at the Capitol in Denver.

The bill targets social media users who illegally sell drugs and firearms or attempt to sex traffic on the platform. It would require companies to determine if a user violated those policies within 10 days of a notification, during which time their account would be suspended. If a company determines someone broke the policy, it would have 24 hours to kick the user off the site. Those companies would need to comply with a search warrant for materials from Colorado law enforcement within three days.
The legislation is an attempt to protect the young users of social media and help law enforcement identify perpetrators and prosecute cases successfully.
“No one sells fentanyl to a kid online just once and then decides the next day ‘You know what? I’m never going to do that again.’ This is repeated conduct,” said Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty. “In the meantime, while we’re waiting for those search warrants to be returned and those records be provided so investigations can move forward, additional people are hurt and killed.”
He pointed to multiple drug cases in his district where most of the sales were occurring over social media platforms.










If this kind of conduct that we see on these social media platforms was happening on the street, there would be no question about intervention. None.


– Sen. Lisa Frizell


The bill has bipartisan sponsorship and support. Sen. Lindsey Daugherty, an Arvada Democrat, Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Parker Republican, and Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat, ran the bill alongside Frizell. It passed the Senate on a 28-5 vote in February and the House on a 46-18 vote in March. Those margins, if they stick, could override a Polis veto.
Michael McReynolds, the legislative liaison for the Governor’s Office of Information Technology, said the office is worried about assigning private social media companies as the arbiters of whether a user broke the law and should be removed from the platform.
“Our main concern is the discomfort with this bill’s reliance on private companies to interpret and enforce the First Amendment. Delegating the nuanced and complex task of balancing free speech rights with the protection of vulnerable populations to private entities raises significant concerns about consistency, transparency and potential for overreach,” he told lawmakers during a House committee hearing on the bill in March.
“If someone is using an expression and talking about that activity, where is that line and how is that being interpreted?” he said.
But that argument is “absurd” and “insulting,” according to Chelsea Congdon, who lost her 19-year-old son to a fentanyl overdose in 2020 when he bought counterfeit drugs over Snapchat to ease his pain after a shoulder dislocation.
“There are no First Amendment rights to sell illegal drugs or guns to anyone, especially children,” she said. “If Senate Bill 86 had been law in 2020, Miles might be alive today. The person who sold him fake Percocet might have been off that platform, and if not before Miles died, then at least before the next kid did.”
Under the bill, social media companies would also need to provide an annual report to the state attorney general’s office with specific data about illegal firearm sales, drug sales, sex trafficking of minors, and creation of sexually exploitative materials involving minors.
McReynolds also raised concerns about how that data collection provision could interplay with the state’s data privacy laws.
The bill has the support of Colorado Ceasefire, the Colorado Children’s Campaign, the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police and the Colorado District Attorneys’ Council.
It still needs to be signed by House Speaker Julie McCluskie before it gets sent to Polis. That begins a 10-day timeline for him to sign or veto it, or it goes into law automatically. If he vetoes it, the Legislature could move to override it with a two-thirds vote. Polis has never had a veto overridden during his time as governor.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House on Monday voted to give the Ethics Commission a six-month deadline to resolve ethics complaints while also removing a new position approved by the Senate.
The amended bill, which passed by a 65-29 vote, will head to the Senate for a concurrence vote before it can go to Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s desk for a signature.
Supporters of the bill say its policy changes would address the Ethics Commission’s growing backlog of ethics complaints. The commission has received more than 60 complaints since the beginning of this year.
House committee recommends removing new Ethics Commission position, adding deadline

Under amendments adopted Monday, Senate Bill 2004 would require the commission to dismiss complaints 180 days after they are filed.
Rep. Mike Nathe, who brought the amendments, said that he believes some North Dakotans are “weaponizing” the Ethics Commission to lodge frivolous complaints against public officials that can drag on indefinitely. The commission has some complaints that are more than two years old.
“It’s just a matter of fairness to the accused,” the Bismarck Republican said. “They shouldn’t have to sit there with this hanging over their head for years at a time.”
House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, spoke against the bill. He said a 180-day deadline would prevent the commission from properly probing cases. It may encourage people accused of ethics violations to not cooperate with investigations in an attempt to run out the clock.
Ista noted the constitutional amendment that created the commission says the Legislature may not do anything to impede its implementation. 
“We’re literally tying their hands,” Ista said.

If the bill is signed into law, it would take effect immediately. Lawmakers indicated their intent is for the clock to start ticking on all the commission’s pending complaints.
The Ethics Commission last week called the changes “a roadblock intended to hamper the commission’s work.”
The House amendments also removed roughly $250,000 for an additional staff member the Senate previously approved. That employee would have focused on education and communications. The funding would have covered a two-year salary, benefits and other costs.
Some House committee members said in hearings they weren’t convinced an additional employee is necessary. The commission has three staff members.
Ista urged the floor to add the education and communications employee back in. He said an employee dedicated to teaching the public about government ethics would help reduce the commission’s caseload by preventing violations from happening in the first place.
“Our Ethics Commission does not want to play ‘gotcha’ games,” Ista said. “What they want to do is help us learn to do what’s right.”
House defeats bill to streamline North Dakota Ethics Commission

The budget does include $50,000 for a new case management system that would track filings with the commission, which staff have said will help streamline its workload.
Some other amendments were lifted from bills that died earlier in the House, including House Bill 1360 — which the Ethics Commission supported — and House Bill 1505.
One new provision gives the board more power to dismiss complaints, for example. Commission staff have said that under current law, the person who submits the complaint wields outsize power over when a complaint may be thrown out, which is partly why some complaints have gone unresolved for extended periods of time.
The amendments also allow people accused of violations to discuss complaints against them.
Another section would protect lawmakers from being prosecuted with a conflict of interest crime for voting on legislation if they adhere to legislative conflict of interest rules or the informal advice of an Ethics Commission staff member.
Additionally, the bill contains a new requirement for the commission to publish an annual report detailing its work.

Carolyn Bosn and Beau Ballard, from left to right, both of Lincoln. April 10, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Legalizing online sports gambling in Nebraska appears to be a risky bet for some state lawmakers. A proposed constitutional amendment advanced Monday but faces an uphill legislative climb.
Legislative Resolution 20CA, from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, would put the decision on whether to legalize online sports betting to voters at the November 2026 election. It advanced 27-16 on the first round of debate in the 49-member body. But as at least one opponent promised a full-fledged filibuster during the next debate stage, the measure would need 33 votes instead.
“Let’s not leave this money on the table,” Bostar said, adding that Nebraskans are already placing bets but revenue is going to neighboring states.
Staying in the ‘driver’s seat’
State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a freshman whose Omaha district is on the Iowa-Nebraska border, repeated Monday what he said in his 2024 campaign: from his front porch, he can see people going over a bridge to Iowa, pulling off into a gravel lot and placing bets. He said Nebraska’s inaction is moving tax dollars to Iowa.
“I don’t want you to like sports betting,” Bostar said, “but I would hope that you would find an offense in us giving our money away to Iowa.”

Bostar said he knew his bill would face tight margins but that at least three of the six lawmakers who missed Monday’s vote are in favor of his measure. It’s getting the remaining three votes that could be tricky and could require flipping at least one current “no” vote. Bostar pledged to work with his colleagues on any desired changes.
Of the senators who haven’t yet voted on Bostar’s measure, State Sens. Beau Ballard of Lincoln and Tom Brandt of Plymouth and Jane Raybould of Lincoln said they support it. State Sens. Rita Sanders of Bellevue and Brian Hardin of Gering opposed an identical measure in August.
State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender, the sixth lawmaker, said he remains “on the fence.”
Constitutional amendments have narrower changes that can be made compared to legislative bills. If approved next year, lawmakers would need to carry out voters’ wishes in 2027.
Bostar has repeatedly defended the legislative push as a way to keep lawmakers in the “driver’s seat of what regulation looks like” and direct new revenue toward property tax relief. Bostar has estimated that the change would generate at least $32 million each year.
‘Don’t sell out our young people’
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who chairs the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, led opposition to Bostar’s bill. He distributed handouts during the debate about the potential social harms of gambling, including depression, anxiety and bankruptcy.
Von Gillern said gambling is predatory by nature, particularly for young men who might face an “illusion of control” from the rapid gratification of 24/7 access to online sports betting.
”Please don’t sell out our young people for property tax relief,” von Gillern told his colleagues.

In a letter Thursday to state lawmakers, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb.; former Gov. Kay Orr; former Huskers football coach and former U.S. Rep. Tom Osborne, R-Neb.; and State Auditor Mike Foley urged senators to reject Bostar’s measure.
The quartet, who have regularly opposed gambling, said lawmakers should “protect our youth and families from the suffering that comes with the addiction that online gambling brings.” Osborne testified against the previous Bostar proposal last summer.
Gov. Jim Pillen has voiced support for legalizing online sports betting, in contrast to his predecessors and his former NU coach and mentor. Pillen has made property tax relief a key goal of his administration.
Multiple senators, for and against Bostar’s measure, agreed that if lawmakers don’t act, gambling advocates might push for getting a broader measure to voters next year anyway.
  State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney echoed Bostar that lawmakers needed to act now to determine what that should look like. He and Bostar said that when the Legislature fails to meet voters’ demands — such as paid sick leave, minimum wage or medical cannabis — the people often go beyond original legislative attempts.
Guereca said that if lawmakers waited, rather than the state collecting 20% of revenue for taxes, the potential revenue might drop, foregoing funds for tax relief or to help problem gamblers.
State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln, who selected Bostar’s measure as his 2025 priority, said passing LR 20CA would allow lawmakers to set proper guardrails and consumer protection measures around online betting.
‘We have to stand up’
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, the only progressive to vote against Bostar’s measure, said she has gambled at the WarHorse Casino and connected racetrack in her Omaha neighborhood. She said she read a lot of information during the debate and was struck about the scale of debt that could be built up in a matter of moments.
“I think that I would rather see people come to the casino, come to my neighborhood, have fun, and I guess make more of an effort than having it at your fingertips,” Juarez said. “I could see how that could be so much more out of control.”
  State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area said taxation wouldn’t help families, and State Sen. Jared Storm of David City called the measure “taxation by exploitation,” most hurting young college students who might gamble away rent or tuition.
“As state senators, we have to stand up for those people,” Storm said.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, noting her son falls in that demographic, said she struggled with supporting LR 20CA while the Legislature is advancing online protections for youths on social media through LB 504 from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln or LB 383 from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman to require age verification.
Bosn supported Bostar’s measure while Storer did not. Storer said the measure should include an explicit provision requiring age verification to ensure bettors are 21 or older.
Voters would get final say
State Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth and Ben Hansen of Blair pushed back on opponents and said the Legislature shouldn’t stand in the way. Brandt described it as becoming a “nanny state.”

Hansen pointed to other addictive behaviors — alcohol, smoking and refined sugar — and said if opponents were against addiction they had a line of other activities to go after. He said the line was between “the side of liberty or tyranny” and that he would “always err on the side of liberty.”
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, who voted against LR 20CA, said she’s not against the issue going on the ballot, but she said supporters should go through the petition process.
Juarez said that petition process could be good, such as through more in-depth, one-on-one conversations with voters.
Even if LR 20CA passes, not all supporters said they would vote for it on the ballot, such as State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte.
“At the end of the day, if it goes on the ballot, I’m going to vote ‘no,’” Jacobson said. “But I think that people should have the opportunity to make that decision.”

A bill that would tighten homeschooling regulations in Illinois missed a key deadline on Friday. But its sponsor, Rep. Terra Costa Howard, said it’s still alive — and she’s working on changes recommended by fellow lawmakers to get it passed.

“We recognize that there’s some more changes that need to be made and so we want to be respectful of the process,” Costa Howard, D-Glen Ellyn, told Capitol News Illinois. “I want to pass a bill that we can be proud of. And even though I’m proud of the bill now, I want to be able to take into consideration some of the other suggestions that have been made.”

The proposal, amended twice in recent weeks, would require parents to file a declaration of intent with their regional office of education. If a truancy investigation arises, officials could ask for schoolwork or lesson plans.

Costa Howard introduced the bill after a Capitol News Illinois and ProPublica investigation last summer revealed Illinois' lack of oversight in cases where children weren’t receiving an education. Illinois has some of the loosest homeschooling laws in the country, and multiple truancy officers told reporters that when they investigated a truancy case and parents claimed they were homeschooling, the investigation came to a grinding halt, even if concerns remained.

In the worst cases, children disappeared from school and endured abuse or neglect at home for years before authorities became aware.

The bill has become one of the most divisive issues at the Capitol this session, drawing thousands of opponents led by two Christian homeschooling organizations: Illinois Christian Home Educators and the Home School Legal Defense Association.

On Thursday, Will Estrada, in an upbeat message on the Home School Legal Defense Association’s Facebook page, shared news that the bill’s sponsors “did not have the votes currently on the floor to move the bill.” The organization's chief legal counsel called it “hard to overstate how significant this news is.” Estrada congratulated homeschooling families for their efforts, adding, “The good news is your phone calls, your efforts, your talking to your friends, your continuing to get the word out to the legislators in Springfield, your voices are being heard.”

However, Estrada cautioned that the stall “doesn’t mean the battle is over.”

On Saturday, Estrada joined Illinois Christian Home Educators Executive Director Kirk Smith in a Facebook video message from a homeschooling conference in Peoria. They urged their followers to tone down their efforts during the legislative break that coincides with Passover and Easter.

“We have kind of a change of strategy,” Estrada said.

“We want to limit the activity politically this week,” Smith added. “We encourage those who may have friends who are representatives to reach out to them lovingly during this time. But let’s give the legislature a little time to catch their breath.”

Though both organizations have stressed their members to communicate their opposition politely with lawmakers, Costa Howard says these organizations have stoked fear, amplifying fringe voices.

Since introducing the bill, Costa Howard said she’s been inundated with hostile calls and emails, even including a letter she perceived as a death threat. The anonymous letter, addressed to Costa Howard at her legislative office in Lombard, referenced HB2827 — the Homeschool Act -- contained five lines:

""It’s all over the country. We all know.
It starts here and must end here.
If we have to break the 6th Commandment, so be it.
God said “Do Not Kill,” but also said “Smite thine enemy.”
We’re watching …."" –Anonymous

Costa Howard turned the letter over to police, who she says are investigating it in her home district.

The bill has also drawn opposition from minority communities. Pastor Chris Butler testified against the bill last week when the amended version came before the House Education Policy Committee.

“I am here today as somebody who grew up in Chicago public schools,” Butler said. “I am here today sitting next to somebody who taught in Chicago's public schools. And we too have grown up, and we too have something to say about the education that we received, and it is why people in our generation have stepped up and said, we must do something different.”

He argued that any regulation would impede minority families from homeschooling to escape failing public schools and encouraged opponents to continue filing witness slips opposing the bill and speaking out against it.

Editorial boards at The Chicago Tribune and The Wall Street Journal have also opposed the bill. The Tribune said the bill “overreaches,” while the Journal raised privacy concerns about the information homeschool families could be required to provide on the forms.

The anonymous letter to Costa Howard was postmarked from a mail distribution site in Kearny, New Jersey, on March 24 — three days after the editorial appeared in the Wall Street Journal. The return address was listed simply as The Rancher, East Coast.

Under Illinois law, threatening a public official is a Class 3 felony. The Lombard Police Department declined to comment, but did provide, under a Freedom of Information Act request, a copy of the report that contained the typewritten, unsigned letter.

Costa Howard also alerted the Illinois State Police regarding the letter. An ISP spokesman said the agency assesses potential threats and determines needed actions based on the findings of the assessment, which may include further consultation and, if necessary, makes recommendations to enhance security.

Despite the vitriolic communication, Costa Howard said she is pressing forward because of those who’ve also reached out to say they were victims of inadequate homeschooling and want more protections in the law.

The bill missed a procedural deadline on Friday for non-budget bills to clear their chamber of origin. But lawmakers can request an extension, which Costa Howard has done.

“The one thing I’ve learned about Springfield is don’t ever count something out,” she said.

Rep. Amy Elik, R-Alton, disagreed.

“This bill was doomed from the beginning,” Elik said from the House floor Friday after Costa Howard made a brief speech about the bill.

Costa Howard says changes to the bill have already been made to address concerns, and that she’s working on more. The amendment that passed a House committee on Wednesday, April 9, provided more specific details for the declaration form, ensured that an online version would be available, and clarified that a truancy investigation would be required to compel families to turn over homeschooling portfolios.

Another change addresses concerns from private schools, which had opposed having to provide a list of students to the Illinois State Board of Education. Under the change, private schools would only need to verify a student’s attendance record if asked in a truancy investigation.

Costa Howard said she remains open to negotiations on the bill’s finer details but believes passing new safeguards is critical to protect children from parents who claim they are homeschooling, but don’t follow through.

“I do not back down from bullies,” Costa Howard said. “And there are victims that have reached out to me constantly thanking me because it has also allowed them to raise their voices and feel that they could speak out about the experiences they’ve had as well.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas House committee approved a proposal Monday to remove all seven members of the State Library Board and allow Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to replace them later this year.
Senate Bill 640 passed the Senate Thursday with support from 27 Republicans. Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, and Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, filed the bill late Wednesday night, less than two hours after Senate Bill 536 hit a dead end with a week left in the legislative session.
Beaty was among a bipartisan group of members of the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs to vote against SB 536. The bill would have abolished both the Arkansas State Library and its board and transferred their powers and responsibilities to the state Department of Education.
Beaty told the same committee Monday that the current board should be replaced because of its “dysfunction” and “infighting.”
Arkansas Senate approves State Library Board overhaul after dissolution bill fails

“There were legitimate concerns that were raised, and those haven’t been addressed,” he said. “[It shows] the lack of consideration of what we need in this state and what our constituents are telling us.”
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, filed SB 536 last month in response to the State Library Board’s failure to pass two measures he requested as conditions for him to drop his promise to abolish the board.
Sullivan has targeted the State Library for its affiliation with the American Library Association, which he claims is a leftist political organization, and for the board’s refusal to adopt policies directing public libraries to keep certain materials out of the hands of minors.
The board rejected both efforts with a 4-3 vote in March. The latter would have created nonbinding policies to protect children from “sexually explicit” content in libraries and detached the State Library from the ALA.
The three board members who supported Sullivan’s requests were all Sanders appointees: former Republican state senator Jason Rapert of Conway, who moved to approve the requests; Shari Bales of Hot Springs, whom the Senate confirmed alongside Rapert; and Sydney McKenzie of Rogers, who joined the board in January and is married to GOP Rep. Brit McKenzie.
Rapert has been the board’s most outspoken advocate for keeping “sexually explicit” content out of children’s reach and has called for the board’s abolition due to the majority’s consistent refusal to back his efforts.
 Committee debate

SB 640 would require the seven new members to draw lots determining how their terms will be staggered, ending between one and seven years from when the bill becomes law. Subsequent appointees would serve seven-year terms, the current length of time board members serve.

Those terms end in October every year, and Rep. Julie Mayberry reminded the committee that Sanders will be able to appoint a new board member in just a few months.
The Republican lawmaker from Hensley said she would not support SB 640 because she personally knows and respects a State Library Board member.
“I know her work and her dedication to students, to families across the state is exemplary,” Mayberry said. “There’s no reason to eliminate every single position on this board.”
Lupe Peña de Martinez of Mabelvale is a former principal at a public school in East End, which is in Mayberry’s House district, and her term on the State Library Board is currently set to expire in 2028.
At the March board meeting in which Sullivan’s two requested motions failed, Peña de Martinez made a successful motion to create nonbinding policies aimed at protecting children in libraries while honoring the First Amendment and library material selection standards. All three Sanders appointees voted against the motion.
Nothing in SB 640 would prevent current State Library Board members from being reappointed, said Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle. He and other Republicans expressed support for the bill as an alternative to SB 536, particularly since SB 640 does not involve the Department of Education in the State Library’s responsibilities. Lawmakers and members of the public both included this as a reason to oppose SB 536.

Mayberry joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting against SB 640.
House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, challenged Beaty’s assertion about State Library Board “dysfunction.”
“They are continuing to have meetings [and] they are continuing to make decisions, even if they’re not the decisions that some people would like,” Collins said. “It’s a functional board. It’s just a board that some people disagree with.”
Collins said he did not believe the Legislature should set a precedent of reconstituting state boards if some lawmakers are frustrated with them. Beaty said he disagreed and was “not concerned in the slightest” about setting such a precedent.
Kristin Stuart of Little Rock, the only audience member to speak against SB 640, agreed with Collins that the proposal is a “power grab.” She said reconstituting the board would “disrupt its mission” of supporting Arkansas libraries and preserving people’s access to information and learning.
“[SB 640 is] opening the door for political appointees who may not have the experience, objectivity or commitment to intellectual freedom that the board requires,” Stuart said.
The State Library Board is scheduled to meet the second Friday in May and in August. If SB 640 passes the House this week and if Sanders signs it, it will go into effect Aug. 1, and it gives Sanders 30 days to replace the board.

(Photo courtesy of Bret Stephens/Loess Hills Landfill)When household waste decomposes at a landfill, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas that traps significantly more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that large landfills monitor and capture the gas, but some landfills in Iowa are going a step further and “upgrading” the landfill gas into renewable natural gas. 
John Foster, the board president of the Iowa Society of Solid Waste Operations, said this process can make economic sense for a landfill and provide an environmental impact during a time when “there’s an energy crisis around the corner.”
Landfills that upgrade their gas end up shifting their wells into what Foster called a “production” model that captures far more methane and carbon dioxide than what is required for compliance with the Clean Air Act.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to EPA, landfills account for 17% of overall U.S. methane emissions and the agency holds that renewable natural gas and other gas upgrading processes help to reduce the amount of methane emitted. 
Only a handful of landfills in Iowa are converting their landfill gas, so some advocates hope to involve smaller facilities by making the process more accessible.
Evolution of landfill gas uses 
When combusted, methane is converted to carbon dioxide, which while still a greenhouse gas, has a much lower global warming potential than methane. 
Sending captured landfill gas up through a flare reduces the emissions of a landfill, by converting that methane to carbon dioxide. But Foster said there is also a potential for energy capture that the industry became interested in. 
He said 20 years ago, the focus was on direct uses of this energy, like using the flare to heat water needed for part of the landfill processes, or using it to power equipment at the facility. 
Then the industry began to realize that energy could replace some fossil fuels and offset some of the environmental cost of burning coal. Foster said some facilities installed generator sets that essentially converted landfill gas into electricity for use either in the plant or to connect and sell into a power grid. 
But, Foster said, as the renewable energy sector continues to focus more on wind and solar, the purchasing price for electricity “doesn’t justify” the cost of maintaining, and installing those generators. 
Updates to the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard program created a structure to sell renewable fuel credits, as it does for other biofuels, for landfill gas converted into renewable natural gas. The program presented an economic incentive for landfills to pursue the costly process of upgrading gas in this way. 
Foster is also the administrator of the Black Hawk County Solid Waste Management Commission, a landfill in Waterloo that is converting its landfill gas into renewable vehicle fuel. 
“We’re taking gas that’s just naturally going to be emitted into the atmosphere from our activity … but instead of just letting it go into the environment as carbon dioxide, we’re actually offsetting diesel fuel by putting it into a vehicle,” Foster said. 
The renewable natural gas, or RNG, facility in Black Hawk County started operating during the summer of 2024. Foster said part of the process involved switching the landfill capture system from “compliance” to “production” to pull as much gas from the landfill wells as possible.
This process reduces the amount of methane emitted into the atmosphere from the facility by an estimated 5,000 tons annually.

Automation maximizes LFG capture, simplifies landfill operations
The Loess Hills Regional Sanitary Landfill in western Iowa is similarly operating with a production capture system.  
The facility installed an automation system that maximizes the amount of landfill gas, or LFG, captured from landfill wells. The gas is then pumped to the Loess Hills Landfill RNG Facility, where the gas is cleaned and injected into a pipeline as natural gas. 
On average, the automated monitoring on the wells, from the company LoCI Controls, increases the amount of methane captured by 15-20%. 
Andrew Quigley, the director of environmental attributes for LoCI, said the technology increases LFG capture by monitoring the gas temperature, flow and composition every couple of hours.

Traditionally, these same metrics would be taken manually, once a month and the valves adjusted to meet the measurements. But, Quigley said landfills are “dynamic” and the gas composition “changes constantly” because of temperature and atmospheric pressure fluctuations. 
“Between these once a month measurements, you can have a ton of variation on what’s going on with the gas generation and what gas collection systems should be doing to better effectively capture that gas,” Quigley said. 
The automated system analyses the readings it takes throughout the day and tunes the system to “most effectively” capture the landfill gas, and provide consistency in the gas that is sent to the RNG facility. 
According to LoCI’s data, the Loess Hills facility processes 1,500 standard cubic feet of landfill gas per minute to upgrade to RNG. The facility hopes to increase that amount to 4,000 standard cubic feet per minute within 15 years, as the amount of waste grows at the facility, which would convert to renewable natural gas equivalent to the energy needed to power nearly 14,000 homes in Iowa per year. 
Bret Stephens, the plant manager at the Loess Hills Landfill RNG Facility, said the automation system gives “real time data” on the wells, which helps not only to pull more landfill gas, but also to identify oxygen leaks in a well which saves time and manpower. 
“What those units can do with their automated tuning in minutes or hours, it would take us all day to do manually,” Stephens said. “If the barometric pressure changes again, we’d be out there readjusting all the wells, and so we’d be constantly chasing our tails.” 
Stephens said the landfill is also able to capitalize on some early action carbon credits, by operating the LoCI systems on waste piles that have been in place less than five years. 
Like the Black Hawk facility, RNG upgraded at the Loess Hills facility is injected into a pipeline and used as renewable vehicle fuel. 
Increasing participation in methane capture 
Foster said the next step is to get these practices onto smaller landfills, many of which don’t currently have the tonnage requirements set by EPA that require landfill gas capturing. 
Some landfills are preemptively building out capture systems and engineering their outfits with methane capture in mind. He said the infrastructure costs of building something like an RNG facility, which was a $40 million investment at Loess Hills for example, continues to be a barrier, though he has seen the cost drop some in recent years as it becomes more widespread. 
A landfill in Dubuque also cleans landfill methane and converts it to natural gas. According to the EPA database, the Loess Hills site has the highest rate of gas flow out of the three RNG facilities in the state. 
  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data shows a growing number of methane capture projects, both at landfills and on agriculture operations. (Graph courtesy of EPA)
EPA also shows that RNG facilities, both in landfills and those on agricultural operations that capture and clean methane from manure are growing in popularity. In the past 10 years, the number of landfill RNG facilities in the country has more than doubled, with more than 100 facilities in 2023. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds introduced a bill that would create regulations for anaerobic digesters as part of her plan to expand energy programs in Iowa.
Foster said energy derived from anaerobic digestion is “really the next step,” though he said the digesters can be applied to many types of organic waste, like food waste for example, and not just from digesting manure on agricultural operations.
The energy bills are advancing through both the Iowa House and Senate.
Foster said public-private partnerships can also be a way forward for landfills wanting to implement methane upgrading technologies. 
The Black Hawk County Landfill’s operation is a partnership with Pine Creek RNG, a private company that invested in both the gas capture system at the landfill and the gas upgrading facility. 
“A landfill is not just this pile of trash,” Foster said. “Once you start realizing that there can be value to it — if somebody can see that value, they’re going to invest in it.”
Foster said he envisions the Black Hawk County facility to eventually work in a “hub and spoke” model and partner with area landfills. This would  allow the landfills to transport their captured gas to the Pine Creek RNG facility to be “cleaned” and put on the pipeline, without the smaller landfills bearing the capital investment of building the facility.
Foster said he believes the RNG market will persist, despite changes to energy policy from the current administration. To him, President Donald Trump’s “drill baby drill” policy is less about fossil fuels and more about prioritizing domestic energy over imported fuel. 
“Renewable energy, it fills in that gap,” Foster said.

Kevin Stitt on Monday said he will appoint a special investigator to look into the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.
The announcement was made in consultation with Commissioner Allie Friesen, and amid “multiple disturbing discoveries with the previous leadership’s finances and contracting practices,” Stitt’s office said in a press release.
“I’ve had frustrations with the mental health department for years and now that we have Commissioner Allie Friesen putting a fresh set of eyes on the department, it’s clear there are problems that need special attention,” Stitt said. “What we need is an independent third party who can focus all their energy on shining a light on this agency and rooting out bad actors.” 
The special investigator will examine the agency’s finances, employment records and contracting practices and report to Stitt’s office. 
Two weeks ago, Friesen told providers her agency was facing a $43 million shortfall. 
“The department welcomes this investigation and will fully cooperate,” Friesen said.
The Governor’s Office did not say in its press release how Stitt’s latest probe would differ from his March 5 request to the Oklahoma Auditor and Inspector’s Office.
At the time, Stitt sent a letter to state Auditor Cindy Byrd, requesting that she conduct a “special investigative audit of the books of accounts” of the agency that probes the “financial management” of the agency over the past five years.
Lawmakers have also tasked the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency to look at the agency.

(Photo courtesy criminal complaint)An Albuquerque man faces federal charges for alleged politically motivated arsons at a local Tesla dealership and Republican Party headquarters, an arrest touted Monday by United States Attorney General Pamela Bondi and other prominent federal law enforcement officials in Washington, D.C.
Jamison Wagner, 40, was arrested late last week following an investigation by multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies, charged with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives. He could face between five and 20 years in prison for each count, according to a news release from the United States Department of Justice. 
“Let this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a news release announcing the charges, which included comparable sentiments from FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy United States Attorney General Todd Blanche. “We will arrest you, we will prosecute you and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.”
Bondi has previously referred to property destruction of Teslas as “domestic terrorism” and promised harsh consequences for those who are accused of it.

Investigators believe Wagner used “improvised napalm material” to ignite Tesla sedans on Feb. 9 of this year at the dealership at the Santa Ana Pueblo in Sandoval County. Two Tesla Model Y sedans were damaged, one of them significantly, in the alleged arson, according to a federal criminal complaint.
Investigators also accuse Wagner of starting a fire that occurred in the early morning hours of March 30 at the headquarters of the Republican Party of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The fire destroyed the front doors to the building but was quickly extinguished without spreading. 
Neither either alleged arson caused any injuries, according to investigators. At both scenes, investigators said, graffiti was sprayed with red paint through stencils that said things like “Die Elon,” “Dia Tesla Nazi” and “ICE=KKK.” Investigators also found glass jars containing the improvised napalm with either an “I” or an “H” handwritten on the lids.

Agents traced Wagner’s white Hyundai sedan from the Republican headquarters to his home in Albuquerque, according to charging documents. In his garage, they found more jars with the incendiary liquid, along with stencils they suspect Wagner used in the graffiti at both crime scenes, according to the documents. 
Charging documents describe the “interstate nexus” for both the Tesla and Republican headquarters attacks, which is used to justify federal charges. The fact Tesla components are made in Germany and China is one reason the alleged arson meets that standard, according to the documents. Additionally, the Republican headquarters sells items from the “The MAGA Mall” based in southern Florida, including hats, bumper stickers and signs, was another way to establish the “interstate nexus,” according to the documents. 
NM GOP renews call for special session on crime after alleged arson at Albuquerque headquarters

Following the damage to the Republican headquarters, statewide Republican leaders held a news conference calling on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call a special legislative session devoted to getting tougher on crime. 
On Monday, New Mexico Democrats and Republicans applauded the arrest. 
“The Democratic Party of New Mexico is grateful to law enforcement for arresting and charging a suspect for the recent arson and vandalism at the Tesla showroom in Bernalillo and the Republican Party of New Mexico office,” the Democrats said in a statement. “Should this individual be found guilty, we hope the U.S. Department of Justice holds them accountable. Politically motivated violence and vandalism are never acceptable.”
Republicans also called for unity in a statement Monday afternoon. 
“We applaud local and federal law enforcement agencies in their swift investigation of these acts of domestic terrorism. Let this serve as an example, political violence and domestic terrorism will not be tolerated,” spokesperson Brandon Harris said in an emailed statement. “Let us come together and move beyond political division to work towards a better future for ALL New Mexicans.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-14-at-3.13.35-PM.png,,,2025-04-14 18:09:05.167269

Travis Jett’s selection marks Stitt’s fourth appointment on the state’s highest court. The court has nine members. 
“I’m committed to using all of my abilities to make sure that the law is applied in a fair, predictable and just manner,” Jett said.
Jett replaces Yvonne Kauger, who voters removed from her post during a November retention vote. Kauger’s defeat marked the first time in history that voters opted not to retain an Oklahoma Supreme Court justice. 
Kauger was one of three justices targeted by dark money groups, including one with ties to Stitt, for being too old and too liberal and being appointed by a Democrat governor.
Voters kept the other two justices, Noma Guruch and James Edmondson, on the bench.
“As he takes a seat on the bench, I look forward to his prudent interpretation of the Constitution and the new energy he brings to the court,” Stitt said.
Stitt and Jett took no questions at a press conference Monday announcing the selection. 
While Jett’s bio contains no previous judicial experience, the Governor’s Office said he has represented a former governor and the State Board of Education. He’s also represented other clients before the state’s ethics, corporation and tax commissions. Jett has also presented oral arguments before Oklahoma’s highest court.
Jett graduated from Oklahoma State University in 2008 with a bachelor’s in agribusiness. He earned a law degree in 2011 from Georgetown University.
He is a past state and national president of the FFA.
Jett previously worked in private practice for GableGotwals, Fellers Snider, and Crowe & Dunlevy before returning to Northwest Oklahoma to practice with the Hodgden Law Firm in Woodward. 
He’ll be sworn in at a later date.

Getty Images Motherhood is a gift — but let’s be clear — it’s also taxing. And I don’t just mean emotionally or physically taxing. I mean financially. Socially. Systemically.
There is a motherhood tax in this country.
And it doesn’t show up on your tax return — it shows up in the grocery aisle, in the child care application, in the quiet spaces where a mother chooses to stay home, not because she wants to, but because she can’t afford to go to work.
At Helping Mamas, the nonprofit I founded in Georgia over a decade ago, we see this cost every single day. We see it in the mothers who wait in line for two hours for a single package of diapers. We see it in the parents who tell us they’ve used plastic grocery bags or cut-up t-shirts when diapers run out.
These stories don’t reflect weakness — they reflect strength.
These women are doing whatever it takes to care for their children. They are creative. Resilient. Resourceful. But the fact that they have to be this resourceful to meet their children’s most basic needs is a policy failure.
Diapers cost an average of $80 to $100 per month per child. There are no federal assistance programs that cover them. And yet, most child care centers require parents to supply diapers in order to enroll. That means if you can’t afford diapers, you can’t access child care. And if you can’t access child care, you can’t go to work.
It’s not just a parenting problem. It’s an economic justice issue.
Add to that the gender pay gap — women are still paid less than men, and mothers are paid less than non-mothers. It’s not uncommon for a woman to lose income, benefits, and long-term financial security the moment she becomes a parent.
This is the motherhood tax. It’s the sum of policies and pressures that make raising children harder and more expensive for women — especially low-income mothers and women of color. But the costs aren’t just financial. The motherhood tax is also social.
Mothers facing diaper need often isolate themselves. They skip doctor appointments, avoid family events, and pull back from their communities out of shame or fear of judgment. And it takes a toll. Diaper need has been directly linked to maternal depression and anxiety. It compounds the already serious crisis in maternal mental health — especially here in Georgia, where we have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country.
The truth is: families need more than praise. They need policies that reflect how much we truly value mothers.
We need elected officials to understand that motherhood isn’t just about moms — it’s about their children, their families, and their communities.
When mothers thrive, families thrive. When families thrive, communities thrive.
We know what the solutions are:

Create an avenue for diapers to be covered through public assistance programs.
Provide tax credits or stipends to cover the cost of essential baby supplies.
Invest in diaper banks and community-based distribution as part of public health
infrastructure.
Eliminate wage penalties for mothers and expand paid family leave and child care
subsidies.

Helping Mamas distributed over 3.2 million diapers last year across Georgia and Tennessee — and we’re still not meeting the full need. We’re doing what we can. But nonprofits alone cannot solve what policy has ignored for far too long.
Motherhood should be a joy — not a financial penalty.
Let’s stop taxing women for raising the next generation. Let’s invest in them instead.

Josh Shapiro’s official residence admitted hatred toward Shapiro and planned to beat him with a hammer if he encountered Shapiro inside the home.
Police on Sunday arrested 38-year-old Cody Balmer in connection with the firebombing that heavily damaged the Pennsylvania governor’s residence early Sunday morning as Shapiro and his family slept inside. The Dauphin County district attorney’s office filed charges early Monday morning against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses.

A criminal complaint filed in district court in Harrisburg says Balmer’s ex-girlfriend called state police to say he was responsible for the fire and that Balmer had asked her to turn him in. A short time later, Balmer approached a member of the state police outside the agency’s Harrisburg headquarters to surrender. In an interview with police, Balmer admitted feeling hatred toward Shapiro and that he used Molotov cocktails made from empty beer bottles to start the blaze, according to the complaint.
He also told investigators he was aware that it was a possibility that Shapiro was in the residence when he set the fire and people could be injured because of his actions. The complaint doesn’t elaborate on the reason for Balmer’s hatred for Shapiro. Public records show a Harrisburg property Balmer owned was recently subject to foreclosure proceedings and Balmer faced simple assault charges that were pending in Dauphin County court.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said. “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”
State police said Monday morning Balmer had suffered a medical event unrelated to the fire or his arrest and was transferred to a Harrisburg-area hospital. His arraignment on the charges was postponed, a court spokesperson said.
Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m., by a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders. The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not OK, and it has to stop.

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania.”
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith. The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said. Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
  ‘Large and complex crime scene’ 

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Chris Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI. Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case. While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said. Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chainlink fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds. 
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
  A Facebook posting on the homepage of Cody Balmer, the Pennsylvania man accused of arson and attempted murder.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
According to the court document filed Monday morning, security video showed Balmer gained entry to the residence grounds by climbing over the fence. He was wearing a black Snap-on Tools jacket, black boots and was carrying a bag, which were later recovered at Balmer’s home along with a small sledgehammer.
Balmer approached the residence and broke an exterior window to the piano room, through which he threw a Molotov cocktail. He then entered the home by breaking a second window and used another firebomb to set the dining room alight. Before he left through the dining room exit, video footage showed he was wearing two different colored gloves — one orange and one yellow — that were later found in a trash can along Balmer’s escape route.
A Facebook account that matched Balmer’s name and personal details showed he had worked as an auto mechanic and included postings expressing dissatisfaction with government generally, President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden. Public records show Balmer last voted in 2022 and had no party affiliation.
The Facebook account, which has since been removed, also included a meme of a needlepoint hoop depicting a Molotov cocktail and the words, “Be the light you want to see in the world.”
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

On Monday, the University of Connecticut confirmed that thirteen international students have had their visas revoked by the Trump administration. 
The revocations are part of a government effort that has left hundreds of students across the country at risk for deportation. The State Department announced on March 27 that it had revoked more than 300 students visas across the U.S.
Roughly a dozen college students across the country have also been detained by the government, including the high-profile case of Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral student from Turkey who was taken into custody in late March and is being held in an immigration detention facility in Louisiana. Ozturk was targeted for co-writing a 2024 op-ed in the student newspaper critical of the university’s response to the Israel-Gaza war.
According to UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz, the students at Connecticut’s flagship university who’ve had their visas revoked include six undergraduates, six graduate students and one person in a post-graduate professional program. In an emailed statement, Reitz said none of the individuals had been given a reason for why their visas were revoked. UConn has a total of 3,450 international students. 
Reitz also said UConn could not provide legal representation for the students. “The University cannot devote resources to funding or otherwise supporting what would be considered the personal costs of individual students and employees based on their association with UConn. This would be using public resources to provide a private benefit not available to the general public,” the statement read.
Reitz’s email added that university leaders are “committed to doing anything we can to support our students, faculty, and staff on this or any issue.”
Last week, Ozan Say, Director of Yale University Office of International Students and Scholars, confirmed that two students at Yale also had their visas revoked by federal officials. An article in the Yale Daily News reported last Friday that the number had risen to four. 
Other Connecticut universities declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment from the Connecticut Mirror. 
Sen. Derek Slap, D-West Hartford, who co-chairs the legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, called the situation “very distressing.” 
“ It’s not about public safety. It’s not about national security … I think it’s just a part of a continued attack on both immigration and then higher education,” Slap said. 
The senator added that if visa revocations end up discouraging international students from studying in the U.S, that could have a negative effect on domestic students as well. “A lot of these international students pay full tuition, and help subsidize the cost of college education for other students,” he said. 
“Right now … the United States is really the higher education capital of the world,” Slap said. “And so if that starts to change, there’s going to be a shift [in] cost to domestic students, who are going to end up having to pay more.” 
Rep. Greg Haddad, D-Mansfield, Slap’s co-chair, said in a statement that there had been “no credible evidence” that any of the students who had their visas revoked had “violated the terms of their stay.” 
“No one should face the threat of deportation for voicing opinions contrary to those held by the current presidential administration. This unprecedented action is wrong,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Unknown.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 17:08:50.331573

(Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images)The Trump administration on Friday denied Washington’s request for federal disaster relief to recover from last year’s bomb cyclone that caused tens of millions of dollars in damage. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s one-page letter doesn’t explain the reasoning for the denial, other than to say federal aid “is not warranted.” 
“FEMA’s Region X Regional Administrator will communicate any additional resources that may be available through Other Federal Agencies and/or volunteer organizations to address unmet needs for survivor assistance,” the letter says. “In addition, FEMA will coordinate with the State of Washington to identify additional damage information to support an appeal if necessary.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, plans to appeal the decision. In a statement Monday, he said “this is another troubling example of the federal government withholding funding.”
“Washington communities have been waiting for months for the resources they need to fully recover from last winter’s devastating storms, and this decision will cause further delay,” Ferguson said.
The state has 30 days to appeal.
After the intense November storm that damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, caused widespread power outages and killed two people, then-Gov. Jay Inslee declared a disaster in a number of counties.
The declaration opened up $1 million in state recovery funding for those hit by the storm in King, Snohomish and Whatcom counties. The U.S. Small Business Administration also made low-interest disaster assistance loans available for residents and businesses in Chelan, King, Kitsap, Kittitas, Pierce, Snohomish and Yakima counties.
In January, Inslee asked for federal aid from FEMA to repair damage to highways, public utilities and more. His request focused on Grays Harbor, King, Pacific, Snohomish, Wahkiakum and Walla Walla counties.
The federal funding typically reimburses at least three-quarters of eligible costs from disasters. 
On the other side of the country, FEMA on Friday also canceled its agreement to fully reimburse North Carolina for the ongoing response to damage from Hurricane Helene. North Carolina’s governor is a Democrat. Republicans control the state Legislature.

(Getty images)Senator Daniel Zolnikov brought one of life’s biggest dilemmas to the Senate floor over the weekend: When you’re microwaving leftovers, how do you determine the perfect amount of time needed to evenly heat your food?
Specifically, how long should you heat up your takeout pork carnitas in its styrofoam container?
“Is it a minute? A minute-and-a-half? The ultimate, ultimate microwave dilemma” Zolnikov asked. “Better to do it a little longer than have it still be cold in the middle.”
However, that decision comes with increased risks
“But you microwaved it too long, and the styrofoam has had some small portions that now also melted.” 
Zolnikov carried House Bill 477 through the Senate, a bill that would ban the use of styrofoam containers in the food industry within five years. He, and other proponents of the legislation, urged lawmakers to consider the known health risks of polystyrene foam, as well as the environmental concerns of using a material that doesn’t break down easily.
But opponents in the Senate, and in prior House debates, decried the legislation as governmental overreach and asked for free-market solutions to handle the problem. 
HB 477, introduced by Rep. Marilyn Marler, D-Missoula, provides for a phase out of expanded polystyrene foam — commonly called styrofoam — containers used to serve or package food from restaurants and food establishment, including coffee cups, plates, trays, and other food and drink carriers. The law would affect roughly 7,500 establishments in Montana, according to the bill’s fiscal note.
The bill creates a three-step process for the phaseout beginning in 2028 with the use of styrofoam containers used to serve food consumed on site. The next year it expands to packaging prepared food, and in 2030 will apply to food packagers and include bakery items and other prepared food. The Department of Environmental Quality would be tasked with ensuring compliance with the rule and issuing fines. 
House lawmakers passed the bill 56-44 in March, and the Senate on Saturday passed the bill 26-24.
In Zolnikov’s microwave example, he asked lawmakers to contemplate a meal of pork carnitas, ordered as takeout from a favorite restaurant, a delicious dish that is hot, fatty and acidic. 
Those three conditions enhance the leaching of chemicals into food, increasing the amount ingested, and contributing to the growing number of microplastics found in all human bodies, including newborn babies. 
In addition, styrene and other chemicals found in food packaging have been linked to cancer, hormone disruption and other chronic health conditions.
 “The thing is, consumers assume our food and food storage products are safe and healthy, and when we realize they aren’t, we take action, or we’re supposed to,” Zolnikov said. 
The bill applies only to styrofoam in the food service industry — not its use in transportation, construction or health and safety industries. It also exempts “raw, uncooked meat, fish, or eggs,” where styrofoam is often used as an insulator to keep those items cold, lowering the risk of chemical leaching. 
Despite the health concerns — widely agreed on by lawmakers — several Senators opposed the bill for its overreach into people’s lives. 
“You should not be heating up food in your microwave in a styrofoam container, in a plastic container, on melamine plates, just about anything, except maybe glass. What you should be doing, if you’re concerned about your health and your kids’ health and your grandkids’ health, heat it up in a frying pan. Not a frying pan with Teflon in it. A good old cast iron frying pan,” said Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, adding that he felt such a law should be the role of the federal government. “That’s the problem with this bill. There are so many other products out there that are causing harm to our health … I don’t like styrofoam either, but this isn’t the answer.”
Eleven other states have passed similar statewide laws, as have numerous local governments.
Other opponents raised concerns that the bill might set a precedent to expand to other industries in the future, while proponents expounded on the environmental benefits. 
“I’ve seen them floating in ponds or water. I’ve seen fish eating the particles that break up,” Sen. Shane Morigeau, D-Missoula said. “…You also will see birds picking up styrofoam, using it in nests and other places eating it as well. And so there’s other things that styrofoam is actually impacting, not just on the food service side.”
The bill was amended in a Senate committee to extend the phase-out timeframe from five to 10 years, but the Senate body changed the bill back to its original form on the floor. 
“If all those arguments aren’t enough to get everybody to vote yes on this, I’ve got a few more,” said Sen. Bruce “Butch” Gillespie, R-Ethbridge, who brought the amendment on the floor. He said that businesses in Montana could manufacture biodegradable packaging using sustainable sources such as hemp. “Let this be the beginnings of a whole new industry for Montana here.”
HB 477 contains a process for a business to request a waiver if they can show undue hardship, such as finding no suitable alternatives for food packaging. A fiscal note for the bill also shows the state would fund a half-time employee to develop and oversee the exemption program. 
“We have chemicals in our food, we have chemicals touching our food, we are being poisoned in more ways than we know,” Zolnikov said. “This is an easy way to say if the feds aren’t gonna do it, we’re gonna do it. We’re gonna phase it out.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1324568012-2048x1167-1-1024x584.jpg,,,2025-04-14 17:08:50.331573

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma is offering bonuses up to $20,000 and thousands more in retention incentives to attract special education teachers to the state.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education budgeted $1.875 million for the initiative with the goal of attracting 110 more teachers to special education classrooms in the 2025-26 school year, the agency announced Monday. The money will come from a federal fund called IDEA Part B, which supports students with disabilities.
Special education teachers working in schools out of state could earn a $20,000 signing bonus if they accept a position in an Oklahoma public school. A newly certified special education teacher could earn a signing bonus of $10,000 to enter the profession.
Out-of-state hires could earn a $5,000 retention bonus in their second year teaching in Oklahoma. Those who are newly certified would receive $2,500 in their second year.
The state agency will send the money to the hiring school district, which would pay the teachers after verifying their employment, according to a news release. The agency will accept applications from May through Sept. 1, and it will award bonuses on a first-come-first-served basis.
“Oklahoma is ready to lead the nation in recruiting and retaining the best special education teachers,” state Superintendent Ryan Walters said in the announcement.
This is the Education Department’s third round of signing bonuses since Walters took office.
The first round offered between $15,000 and $50,000 to certified early elementary or special education teachers who hadn’t been working in Oklahoma schools the year before. The program attracted more than 500 educators, though the agency paid a handful by mistake.
A second round of singing bonuses recruited 61 educators to rural districts to teach middle- and high-school science or math. The Education Department offered these teachers up to $25,000 and budgeted $1.2 million in total.
A bill that would have encoded $35,000 teacher signing bonuses in state law failed to advance in the state House this year.

Suzanne Wikle raised concerns that House Bill 2240 will slow down state agency processes by requiring legislative approval for state assistance changes, among other things. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bill barring Kansans who use food benefits from buying soda and candy failed to move forward last week, while another bill passed that opponents said would stall stage agencies’ ability to react to changes in assistance programs and intellectual or developmental disability services.
Senate Bill 79, which would have stopped anyone using  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits from purchasing soda and candy, died when the House failed to take up the bill to override Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto. The Senate voted to overturn the veto, 29 – 11.
Both chambers, however, voted along party lines to override the governor’s veto on House Bill 2240. Opponents expressed concerns that it would create obstacles for state agencies to move quickly in making needed changes in Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs. The bill requires legislative approval for any changes expanding eligibility for public assistance programs, increasing state costs or making certain changes for individuals receiving IDD services. If the Legislature isn’t in session, decisions will be made by the Legislative Coordinating Council, which has 14 days to act.
“Just the Medicaid ones, every single administration that we’ve had since I’ve been an adult has over 100 things that would have had to go before a legislative body,” said Rep. Suzanne Wikle, a Lawrence Democrat, during a March debate.  “I don’t think we understand how many things we’re talking about. This bill requires that all changes — simple, mundane changes that all states make to programs all the time to keep in compliance with federal regs, update certain things for Medicaid, for SNAP, for child care assistance, for TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) — those are all going to have to go before some sort of legislative body now.”
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Democrat from Overland Park, echoed those concerns before the Senate override vote last week.
“It shifts power away from actual experts in our agencies, and this will hurt our response time for critical programs and cause bottlenecks in our processes,” she said, adding that there are appropriate processes in place for oversight of spending.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican, said this bill puts the responsibility for spending where it should be.
“The reason for this is that the Legislature, not bureaucrats, should be overseeing the allocation of funds and making those decisions,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3110948-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-14 17:08:50.331573

A group of over a dozen people from the Manor House Tenants’ Union held a press conference with Rep. Bobby Gibson, D-Hartford, and representatives from the Connecticut Tenant’s Union, a tenant rights group that has 18 chapters across the state. 
The Manor House tenants said their housing complex doesn’t dispose of garbage adequately and has frequent sewage problems. There isn’t enough parking for tenants and many of the units are ridden with mold, they said.
“Everybody has a different inconvenience that we are dealing with,” said Morrison Hughes, chapter vice president of the Manor House Tenants’ Union.
The event comes as lawmakers are once again grappling with the complicated political question of how to best regulate the relationship between landlords and tenants. Legislators have proposed several bills this session, notably one that would largely ban no-fault evictions that typically occur at the end of a lease.
Landlord groups say that bill, H.B. 6889, would make it difficult for them to evict problem tenants, and they say it interferes with their personal property rights. But tenants argue that one of the reasons people often face no-fault eviction is because they’ve asked for repairs, like those requested in Bloomfield, and their landlord retaliates. Many tenant union members and leaders have faced no-fault evictions after complaining about living conditions.
Lawmakers are also considering a bill that would require all towns to have fair rent commissions. These town-level commissions can hear complaints about unfair rent increases and poor housing conditions. Often, these cases come in the form of a landlord who wants to raise the rent and tenants who dispute the increase, saying repairs haven’t been made.
“A lot of the issues with rent increases and lack of adequate living conditions are reflected across the state,” said Hannah Srajer, President of the Connecticut Tenant’s Union. “We hope that elected representatives know their responsibility to their constituents means giving tenants what they need to live fuller lives.”
The tenants’ union movement has been growing in Connecticut over the past few years. The unions operate similarly to labor unions, and tenants collectively bargain for better housing conditions and against rent increases.
Friday’s press conference was the latest show of that growth, which has resulted in more political power over the past couple of sessions as tenant union members have shown up in droves to speak at public hearings and talk to legislators.
Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the statewide tenants’ union, said the group is channeling its energy towards advocating for H.B. 6889, which would expand tenants’ rights by making landlords give a valid reason for eviction or release of a tenant from a property. “We wanted to put a lot of our energy into something we thought we could feasibly win this year” he said.
Residents at Manor House originally tried to address the issues directly with the landlord. After they had seen no change they decided to take actions into their own hands. The Manor House chapter was formed in July of last year in response to ongoing issues with the apartments.
During the press conference, Rep. Gibson expressed sympathy with the residents of Manor House and said he would continue to aid their ongoing fight for better apartment standards. He said has had a conversation with Navarino Property Group, which owns the complex, to ask them about poor conditions at their properties.
Justin Goldberg, founder and principal with Navarino, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Julian Alleyne, a Manor House renter who co-leads the tenants’ union there, said he started noticed the issues with mold, garbage disposal, sewage and poor drainage last year. “They are treating families like dollar signs. It is a problem,” he said.
Hughes, of the Manor House union, said he felt a sense of responsibility to work to improve conditions for his fellow residents. “Whatever we accomplish today extends far beyond [us],” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0411_SR_PressConference_076-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 17:08:50.331573

House Bill 651, sponsored by Rep. Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, creates an exemption in state fire code for temporary door locks in public buildings.
Temporary door locks can help save lives, according to a study published in the Journal of Mass Violence Research. In fact, the Sandy Hook Commission, a report by the federal government, found in 2015 that there has never been an active shooter event where the shooter breached a locked door.
“Currently, our fire code is fairly direct and provides no exceptions,” Regier said during the bill’s hearing on March 21 before the Senate State Administration Committee. “It states it is unlawful to obstruct a fire exit or any hallway corridor or entrance way leading to a fire exit. Yet in an active shooter emergency, one of the first steps that is recommended to protect potential victims is to secure the door.”
A code official, or whomever has jurisdiction of a building, would have to approve of the use of temporary locks, and they could only be used in a “shelter-in-place or emergency lockdown situation.”
The bill had several proponents during the hearing, including from the Montana Police Protective Association and the Montana Professional Firefighters.
Both said the door locks Regier’s legislation permits would not be a barrier for emergency access to buildings.
“I think this is a good idea,” Carter Marsh, representing Montana Professional Firefighters, said. “I think it can keep our kids safe, and I think that we should take any step we can, and it still allows for local control to have that ultimate say.”
A company, Nightlock, also spoke in favor of the legislation. That company sells locks that can quickly be put in place during an active shooter situation. They are stored near a room’s entrance and are physically taken and put under the door.
The House voted 97-3 to approve the legislation, while the Senate voted 49-1 during the bill’s second reading. It will still need one more procedural vote by the Senate to reach the Governor’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1266645465-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 17:08:50.331573

(Photo Credit: Jeff Anderson/USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service)Water officials have raised concerns about anticipated water levels in Southern Nevada this summer, following a disappointing winter snowpack that threatens to stall progress made during last year’s wetter-than-average season.
Snowpack in the Upper Colorado River Basin, which provides streamflow for the two largest reservoirs in the United States — Lake Mead and Lake Powell  — has underperformed this winter, reinforcing long-term drought challenges facing the west.
Snowpack is a crucial source of water for Nevada and the West. As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland.
Despite two consecutive decent water years, both reservoirs could see gains reversed, according to the monthly Nevada Water Supply Outlook Report from the Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“Southern Nevada should expect a lean water year with less than normal streamflow predicted for the Virgin River and the Colorado River inflow to Lake Powell,” reads the report.
According to the report, the Upper Colorado Basin’s snowpack only reached 89% of the historical median this April, which is considered the month when the snowpack reaches its highest snow water total before melt begins.
That could spell trouble for water levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell which are already suffering deficits due to drought impacts and high water demands. 
Water officials estimate that streamflow for Lake Powell will be at about 74% of the historical median, according to the report. Lake Powell’s water levels directly affect Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead as of March is down 691,000 acre-feet compared to the same time last year, or enough water to supply 1.3 million households. Both reservoirs combined are at 33% of capacity as of April.
Snowpack in Southern Nevada’s Spring Mountains has also underperformed this winter, hitting only 30% of its historical median. Snow melt from Spring Mountains is the largest source of groundwater for Southern Nevada and provides some limited water to Lake Mead. 
However, Spring Mountains did receive much needed rain in March, hitting about 229% of the historical median as of March. 
Despite deficits in Southern Nevada, other parts of the state are looking at a more robust water year. Snowpack in the Eastern Sierra is about normal at 105% of median, compared to 134% at this time last year.
Snowpack in several basins that supply water for the Reno-Sparks area — including the Walker River, Carson River, Truckee River and Lake Tahoe basins — are at about normal as of April. Combined all four basins hit nearly 98% of their historical median. 
Snowpack is well above normal in other parts of Northern Nevada, especially in regions along the Oregon-Nevada border. 
That snowmelt will also help bolster already healthy reservoirs in northern Nevada. Most reservoirs in northern Nevada were near normal to well above normal storage as of March, according to the report.
Snowpack in the Humboldt, Owyhee, Snake, Clover-Franklin basins — largely located in Elko County — reached well above normal snowpack at 122% to 151%.
The Humboldt Basin has now seen three consecutive winters with snow water peak amounts above normal. There hasn’t been a three-year period with better consecutive snowpacks in the Humboldt Basin since the mid-1980s. The Humboldt Basin is a major course of water for Humboldt, Elko, Lander, and Eureka counties 
Snowpack in the Northern Great Basin, located largely in Humboldt County, also reached well above normal at 151% median as of early March. Precipitation in March in the Northern Great Basin was also about normal at 96%.
Snowpack in Eastern Nevada — which covers the majority of White Pine County and part of Eureka County — improved dramatically from 55% in early March to 86% by early April.
While March significantly improved snowpack in Eastern Nevada, snowpack in the region is still below the historical median, hitting 86% of median. Snowpack in the region was also not distributed evenly. 
“Eastern Nevada is a mixed bag with better mountain snowpack conditions near Austin, Eureka and Ely, but well below normal snow in Great Basin National Park,” read the report. “It should be noted that snow percentages in Eastern Nevada vary widely from site to site ranging from twice normal to less than 50%.”
Above normal rain also helped improve conditions in Eastern Nevada, reaching well above normal at 182% in March, 
Above normal precipitation in March also reduced drought severity on the US Drought Monitor Map in Elko, Churchill, Lander and Eureka counties over the last month. But areas of extreme and exceptional drought in southern Nevada remain unchanged from last month.
Dry conditions in Southern Nevada followed a pattern of drought throughout the Southwest this winter, according to the latest National Water and Climate Center report from the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
The Southwest experienced a snow drought and precipitation deficit this season, with well-below normal streamflow from snow melt expected for the spring and summer period, according to the National Water and Climate Center report.
Above-normal springtime temperatures are also causing a rapid melting of high-elevation snowpacks across the entire West, which could impact streamflow as snow melts before it’s most needed in the summer.
In Nevada, snowmelt started early due to a week of warm temperatures in late March. Daily average air temperature at snow monitoring sites across Nevada peaked at 48 degrees Fahrenheit on March 26th, very close to a record for that date.
Those conditions are expected to continue in Nevada in the long term. The National Weather Service predicts there is a 40 to 50% chance most of Nevada will see above average temperature from April through June, according to the National Water and Climate Center report. Climate scientists predict Nevada will also see below average precipitation during that same period.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-13-25-at-3.25-PM-e1744583200719-1024x735.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A sea of red descended upon the Indiana Statehouse Monday as hundreds of teachers, parents and students from across the state rallied to demand increased funding for public schools — and to protest pending policy proposals that could shift millions of local dollars to charters.
The rally — one of many hosted in recent years by the Indiana State Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union — came just hours ahead of a possible final vote on a massive property tax plan. The latest provisions baked into the legislation could reduce public schools’ tax dollars by as much as $744 million over the next three years.
ISTA President Keith Gambill said that blow comes in addition to education funding gaps in the newest draft of the state budget.
“The overall funding increase of 2% per year — of $870 million — does not even meet inflation,” Gambill said. “Our students deserve bold investment, not the bare minimum.”

He said teachers will be pressing lawmakers in the coming days and weeks “to ensure that public dollars are staying with public schools.”
ISTA organizers demand action
The legislative session must end by April 29 but could be finished as early as April 24. All bills — including the state budget — must be finalized by that time.
“Our schools deserve to be fully funded — and fully public — so all kids receive a quality education,” Gambill emphasized.
Teacher attendance at the rally forced at least three Hoosier school districts to move to an e-learning day, including Indianapolis Public Schools and nearby Pike Township, as well as Monroe County Community Schools in Bloomington.










Our schools deserve to be fully funded — and fully public — so all kids receive a quality education.


– Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill


The shift to e-learning appeared to prompt a legislative amendment published Monday morning by Indianapolis Republican Rep. Andrew Ireland.
Proposed language filed to Senate Bill 373, an unrelated education bill, sought to jeopardize funding for public school districts that convert scheduled in-person instructional days to virtual because of “planned or coordinated absence of teachers or other personnel for the purpose of participating in a protest, demonstration, or political advocacy event.”
Districts would risk losing state tuition support for each day of a violation, according to Ireland’s amendment.
Gambill read the amendment aloud during the rally, drawing shouting and boos from the crowd.
“We have got to talk to our legislators today, tomorrow and every day between now and the end of the session. We must be vigilant,” he said. “We have to speak from the heart, and remind them that behind every policy is a classroom with a teacher and students.”
Ireland introduced the amendment Monday afternoon to make a statement, but withdrew it without discussion or a vote.
Rallygoers demand action
Chants echoed throughout the Statehouse halls for more than two hours Monday morning.
“Schools need funding!”
“Pay our teachers!”
“Defend public education!”
Rallygoers, many dressed in red t-shirts, had homemade signs in tow, too. Banners, poster boards, paper placards — and even painted messages on the backs of LaCroix boxes — were raised by attendees amid chanting, cheering and frustrated yells.

Everyone’s goal was the same: demand “fair” and “adequate” funding for public schools.
Gambill said recent changes to both bills were improvements from their original versions. But he maintained that increases to base tuition support in the Senate GOP’s state budget draft “are not enough,” and held that amendments added to the property tax measure would divert “critical” dollars from traditional publics to charters and could allow districts to “side step” collective bargaining rights for teachers.
Monica Shellhamer, a vice president with the Indianapolis Education Association, said during her rally remarks that teachers continue to be left out of conversations around school funding.
“Indianapolis public schools has been a target of the legislature for many years and this year is no different,” Shellhamer said. “Bill after bill continued to be submitted to shut down or defund Indianapolis public schools.”
Jenny Noble-Kuchera, president of the Monroe County Education Association, further pointed to pending education cuts at the federal level.
“The way it is currently, public education as we know it will begin to disappear, and our children are the victims,” she said Monday. “We already have severe mismanagement at the federal level of Title I grants for our lower-income students, of critical programs supporting students with disabilities, and elimination of programs for our schools.”
“This is bad enough, and now Indiana politicians can’t put their youngest constituents first, and support basics, like learning to read and write, and foundational math,” she continued. “It’s not OK.”

What is the state doing to fix it?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s John Moritz to discuss his article, “Lawmakers seek solutions as CT trash piles up,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read John’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, John. You report that Connecticut is producing more trash than we can handle. How did we get here, considering that years ago, we set up these huge trash-to-energy plants, and I thought that would be the solution?
JM: Yeah, so you’re right, and I actually spoke with one of the lawmakers, State Representative Mary Mushinsky of Wallingford, who was instrumental in setting up that network of waste-to-energy facilities back in the eight late 80s and early 90s. That network actually resulted in the landfills in Connecticut that had been permanently in place to accept, you know, municipal solid waste, which is just a fancy term for household trash, as a result of setting up those waste energy plants, all those landfills slowly started coming offline, to where we’re at the point now, where the only landfills we have left in Connecticut are really accepting specialty bulk waste or other things that’s not part of the typical municipal waste stream. So fast forward 20-30 years, some of these facilities have started to increasingly age. We’re seeing them break down more often. They’re costing more to run. And in 2022, the largest of these facilities, Hartford’s Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority actually closed down, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of tons of trash that had been previously burned at that incinerator in the south meadows of Hartford having to be shipped out of state, and they’re now going as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania.
WSHU: It costs us a lot of money to ship all this trash across the country.
JM: Yeah. So that’s one of the concerns that’s been raised by both local leaders and state officials at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, is that not only does it cost more to ship this trash long distances, either on tractor trailers or on rail cars, but once it gets to the landfill, we’re not the only state exporting our trash. There’s competition for a limited amount of space, and that’s causing our tipping fees to go up.
WSHU: So, what are the solutions that lawmakers are considering?
JM: So two years ago, there was a big debate over basically how to put the funding mechanism in place to build a new facility that would take the place of the MIRA plant in Hartford. Now, there’s been a lot of environmental objections to the idea of burning waste in Connecticut. Almost no one wants to see new landfills pop up. You know, those who have been around long enough might remember Mount Trashmore in Hartford, which you can still see from I -91 if you’re driving up to Springfield, that’s been capped. It’s no longer accepting trash, but that’s a legacy of when we used just to put our trash in landfills.
So in terms of actually finding a long-term solution, we haven’t really gotten far. There was some bonding put in place two years ago in 2023, but it hasn’t been taken out or utilized. So this year, they’re taking a much more incremental approach, basically trying to find ways to fund diversion efforts and encourage people to take food scraps, things that can be composted, that don’t need to be put into the solid waste stream. Take that out. Increase recycling rates, our recycling rates are in the 30s percentage-wise, and officials want to see that get up into this around 60%; we’re not there yet. So, it’s more focused on these diversion efforts at the moment than really finding a long-term solution.
WSHU: What are the incentives for people to change their habits?
JM: One of the biggest issues that officials face is not only trying to incentivize but to get these programs up and running. I live in New Haven; currently, unless I have a yard – which I don’t – my options to compost are to drive to one of three or four bins set up around the city where they’re accepting compost. And now that’s a startup that just went online recently in New Haven. Other cities have no place where, if you don’t have your own backyard to compost trash, there’s really not a lot of options. So a lot of these programs are about getting the options there to people, creating a system where people can both separate their own trash at home and then have a place where it’s either collected from their house like you would, you know, your typical trash, or a place where they can take it and have it be source separated for places that do have these options. A lot of it is focusing on education, setting up websites for people to be able to go and see, hey, what goes into compost, what doesn’t, what’s recyclable, what’s not, what needs to be sent out with the regular household trash, and what can be separated.
WSHU: How about trying to limit the trash that comes into the system, things like dealing with single-use plastic and all that? There’s legislation to deal with that, too.
JM: Yeah. So this is another effort that we’ve seen come back year after year the last couple of years, to ban the single-use polyurethane trays. We know it by the brand name Styrofoam, but that’s something that’s not really recyclable. It fills up the waste stream. Environmental advocates don’t like it, and so there have been proposals to prohibit these types of items and force restaurants and other businesses to use more environmentally friendly paper and compostable materials instead of these single-use plastics. We’ve seen the restaurant industry lobby against this successfully in recent years, but lawmakers are back this spring with their latest proposal, which would put a prohibition in place beginning in 2026.
WSHU: I saw something interesting in your article about people being charged more for the amount of trash they put out.
JM: Yeah, so that’s a proposal known as unit-based pricing or pay-as-you-throw. Basically, it does exactly what it sounds like. The more trash you produce, the more you pay to dispose of that trash. It’s been a program that’s been in place in some municipalities, most notably Stonington, that has used this system since the early 1990s. Though it’s prompted, you know, pushback from other areas. I believe West Hartford looked at using such a system several years ago, but there was enough outcry from local residents that this was going to raise the cost of them throwing out their trash. And so, I believe that the municipality did not go ahead with that proposal. But that’s one that DEEP is looking to fund pilot programs for. Basically, one of the bills that would be in place this year, if it gets out of the legislature, would impose fees on the trash that is shipped out of state, and the collection of those fees would go to fund pilot programs in various municipalities to try to find some innovative solutions to get ourselves out of this crisis.
WSHU: So the bottom line is that there’s no big fix for a trash problem.
JM: Yeah, at the moment, the discussion is mostly around finding incremental solutions, and that kind of big be-all, end-all fix seems to be at least several years down the pipeline at the moment.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0410_SR_TrashCenter_088-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 17:08:50.331573

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill set to be considered Tuesday could force rural emergency service providers to shut down by reducing a needed source of funding, a leader of the state’s Ambulance Association said Monday.
But a Senate lawmaker said the proposed reimbursement rate cut to Oklahoma’s ambulance providers could save Oklahomans as much as $60 a year on their health insurance plan costs.
Senate Bill 1067, which is scheduled to be heard in the House Rules Committee, would authorize local government entities or ambulance service providers to submit ambulance service rates to the Oklahoma Insurance Department to create a public database. It would also cut the minimum amount that out-of-network ambulance providers can be reimbursed. 
Robin Robinson, vice president of the Oklahoma Ambulance Association and director of McClain-Grady County EMS, said she was at the Oklahoma Capitol Monday to encourage lawmakers to vote “no” on the bill. 
She said it strips local control from municipalities and county governments and would limit the amount her agency collects. She said it comes just months after a state law took effect that allowed ambulance providers to charge more. Robinson said if the new bill became law, the financial difference could equate to the salary of a full time paramedic. 
“With the bill that was passed last year, I was hoping that we could add another paramedic to staff full time,” she said. “My call volume is increasing, and that’s not going to change, but the money to be able to staff isn’t there. And so if this bill passes, I’m not going to be able to add that full time, permanent position.”
The average salary for a paramedic in Oklahoma is $48,640, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Robinson said salaries vary around the state depending on location and demand. 
Instead of letting local governments set reimbursement rates based on what’s needed to keep EMS providers in business, the bill creates a “cap all the way across the board,” Robinson said.“If I can’t staff the extra ambulances during the times that I need, we have to call in mutual aid ambulances, and that’s going to be anywhere from 15, 20, 25 minutes to get there,” she said. “This could hurt Oklahomans. You know, we have ambulance services that are further out than I am, more rural. It could hurt them worse, they may have to shut down.” 
Rep. Preston Stinson, R-Edmond, the House author, was not available for comment Monday.
But Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, the Senate author of the bill, said the new law, which took effect in January, could increase the cost of Oklahomans’ health plans by $3 to $5 per month.
He said it does not prevent local governments from setting ambulance service rates and only affects out-of-network providers. He said the measure drops reimbursement rates by 50%, from 325% of the Medicare or Medicaid rate to 275%, to help alleviate strains on health care plan costs
“That’s a massive, massive thing on the people of Oklahoma and their health plans,” he said. “We do know that ambulance people need a bump, so we just dropped it. The insurance people didn’t want it to be up more than 150%. Ambulance people, of course, want it to stay at 325% because if it stays the same, they keep getting paid. All I’m saying is, ‘Hey, let’s drop it 50 percentage points, and then you still get a raise and the people of Oklahoma’s health plan doesn’t come up.’ ”
He said the public database would let insurance companies know what local reimbursement rates are set at. 
The bill, which has already cleared the state Senate, would be eligible to be heard on the House floor if it passes committee Tuesday.

The reduction is significantly less than the near-$5 billion House Speaker Daniel Perez has pushed for through a reduction in the sales tax rate paid on goods and services (HB 7031) and the $5 billion Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to give Florida homeowners in the form of $1,000 in property tax rebates.

The bill directs the Office of Economic and Demographic Research to conduct a study to establish a framework to reduce, or eliminate taxes for homesteaded property. The report on accomplishing those goals would be submitted to legislative leadership by Nov. 1.
The study must include at least: 

An analysis of the potential impact of eliminating property taxes on public services, including education, infrastructure, public safety, and emergency services.
An assessment of potential housing market fluctuations, including changes in homeownership rates and property values.
An analysis of consumer behavior regarding home improvements that now result in property tax increases, including elevating homes in flood-prone areas, adding a mother-in-law suite, etc., and whether reducing or eliminating property taxes would change consumer behavior leading to an increase in resiliency.

The findings would help inform the Legislature about how to “craft a constitutional amendment for voters to consider during the next General Election.”
An example of a nonrecurring tax relief would be a one-time credit for the annual license tax tag fees associated with annual vehicle registrations.
The credit would apply to new registrations issued on or after July 1, 2025, and existing registrations that expire after Sept.  30, 2025. The credit would be available until October 2027, to ensure residents who purchase registrations before the tax credit takes effect and those who purchase two-year registrations can take advantage of the opportunity.
Another example of a nonrecurring sales tax is the newly created tax holiday for hunting season between Sept. 8 and Dec. 31, when enthusiasts can save on “ammunition firearms, bows, crossbows, and related accessories,” according to a press release announcing the details of the tax package.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)When Washington’s 147 legislators kicked off the 2025 session three months ago, solving the problem of an ever-growing shortfall in the state’s next operating budget topped their to-do list.
They haven’t done it yet. They’ve got 13 days, or roughly 300 hours, left to find a solution in order to finish on time and avoid a special session. And the latest barometer of the state’s economy shows the situation is worsening.
This isn’t the only uncompleted task on the legislative checklist.
Huge differences on a rent cap bill need reconciling. There’s a transportation budget to finish writing and the amount of a gas tax hike to settle on. And public school students may wind up with their own bill of rights, as their parents did last year, or maybe not.
Start the clock. Set it for 11:59:59 on April 27. That’s the final scheduled moment of the regular session. The last time lawmakers went into extended overtime was 2017 when it took three special sessions to get a budget deal.
Tax and spend
Democrats in the House and Senate drew up spending plans for the two-year budget cycle that starts July 1. Then they used their majorities to pass them over the objections of Republicans.
GOP members opposed them because each counts on historically large tax increase proposals to overcome the shortfall, pegged by the governor to be $16 billion spread over the next four fiscal years. And none of those taxes had been voted on in either chamber.
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson upended the process when he put the kibosh on Democrats relying on billions from an untested tax on the assets of really wealthy people to balance the ledger sheet.
Now, the status is unclear for other major pieces of their revenue-raising plan. This includes a payroll tax on large employers, higher business taxes on corporate and banking giants and lifting the cap on what cities, counties and the state can collect in property taxes each year. There’s formidable opposition to each.
Democratic lawmakers and Ferguson agree any solution will involve some taxes. The conversation is focused now on which ones. There could be more clarity later this week.
Meanwhile, budget negotiators need to settle on where to shave spending. There are many tough decisions in that arena.
For example, Ferguson and Senate Democrats are interested in furloughing state workers; hundreds of employees loudly dissented last week. And, with public schools, the Senate pumps about $800 million more into special education than the House. Getting more dollars into the operation of public schools was the topic of a February rally of students, parents and educators.
The differences fill a spreadsheet. Until they know what taxes they can pass, Democrats will be hard-pressed to make final decisions on where to trim.
Politics at the pump
Washington lawmakers must also adopt a new two-year budget for the state’sits transportation system before calling it quits. That’s not simple. 
The Senate-passed proposal spends about $1 billion more than the House. It also shifts future spending obligations tied to removing barriers to fish passage over to the capital budget while the House pencils in more money to deal with these culverts.
There’s another problem. Incoming revenues, primarily from the gas tax and vehicle fees, aren’t enough to carry out long-promised projects. So the House and Senate each assembled a package of new and higher fees plus a bump up of the state’s nearly highest-in-the-nation gas tax.
There’s disagreement here too. The Senate’s plan is anchored by a 6-cent per gallon increase in the state’s current 49.4-cent gas tax, with 2% increases each year after to account for inflation. The House wants to raise the state tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation. Senators approved a much longer list of new and higher fees than House members.
Ferguson has not publicly signaled which lane he’s in. He’s not even said if he’ll sign a gas tax increase.
Rent cap clash
House Democrats want a statewide cap on residential rent increases. It’s a top policy priority. They had high hopes the Senate, which blocked it last year, had shifted far enough to the left to make it happen.
Twenty-nine of the 30 Democratic senators did vote to pass House Bill 1217. Not before making substantive changes, like hiking the limit on rent increases to 10% plus inflation in a single year, up from the 7% cap the House backed. The Senate also exempted single-family homes and set the law to expire in 15 years.
A conference committee of four Democrats and two Republicans will likely be deployed to wordsmith a version that the majority party in each chamber can stomach enough to approve. Republicans have been and will be a hard no.
Schoolhouse rocks
There’s been much gnashing of teeth among Democratic lawmakers since they enacted the parental “bill of rights” initiative last session. They intend this session on, in their words, fixing language in that 2024 law to clear up confusion and conform its provisions with existing statutes.
Senate Bill 5181 is the vehicle. It reached the House floor Monday. At each stop, Republicans and those who helped get Initiative 2081 to lawmakers last spring say it rolls back the rights granted to parents.
In the meantime, House Democrats drew up House Bill 1296, which they describe as a “bill of rights” for students. Opponents decry it as an attempt to further weaken the initiative and undermine the authority of school districts.
The two bills were united at one point this session. Now they’re not. Both could get to the governor’s desk. Both may not. And, as is often the case this session, the new governor has yet to voice an opinion publicly.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wa_state_capital-1024x610.jpg,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has announced a new “trauma-informed tool” meant to better keep victims of crimes informed about parole processes involving their offenders and available services. 
The board on Monday announced the launch of a MyVoice, a new software designed to better notify victims of crimes of services and other information, including when their offenders have upcoming hearings.  
“For years, the Board has relied on an offender management system to access victim information,” the board announced in a news release. “MyVoice represents a significant shift toward a victim-centered approach, enabling the Board to provide more timely and sensitive notifications regarding hearings that victims have a right to attend, along with introductory information about the post-sentence parole process.” 
Scott Stephenson, chair of the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, said in a prepared statement that the board is “committed to providing trauma-informed notifications to victims, and the launch of MyVoice is a major step in this direction.”

MyVoice’s first phase enhances the board’s ability to email victims who prefer electronic communication over traditional mail, according to the board. 
“It also gives Board staff access to a trauma-informed platform where they can update and manage victim contact information more efficiently,” board officials said. “In addition, the new system has allowed for important updates to the language used in notification letters, making them more informative about the post-sentence parole process and more considerate of victims’ experiences.”
Jennifer Yim, administrative director of the board, called the launch of MyVoice a “major milestone.” 
“As an agency, we are committed to continuing the development of this platform to reach our end goal — allowing victims to independently enter and manage their contact information and to offer additional options, such as text messaging notifications,” she said. “We thank the victim services representatives and victims who have helped us understand the needs of victims to inform this process of improving our services.”
The board included a link to templates for four “victims’ notifications letters,” which include information about why the board would be contacting victims, their right to be informed about an upcoming hearing for the offenders, and contact information for victim coordinators that can provide more information about resources that are available to them. 
“The Board remains committed to protecting public safety through transparency, accessibility, and delivering services that recognize the rights and experiences of victims throughout the parole process,” board officials said.

Free.,Lawsuit filed after Trump’s budget office shuts down public information about spending,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/lawsuit-filed-after-trumps-budget-office-shuts-down-public-information-about-spending,,"WASHINGTON — A nonprofit organization filed suit against the Trump administration on Monday, alleging its decision to stop posting budget documents in late March violates federal law.Protect Democracy Project’s case is the second lawsuit challenging the Office of Management and Budget’s choice to pull down a webpage with apportionment information that detailed when and how the administration was spending money appropriated by Congress.The case, as well as the one brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington last week, asks a federal judge to require OMB to restore the website that publicly shared the data for years.OMB Director Russ Vought told Congress late last month that the budget office would no longer publicly post apportionment information, writing in a letter that to do so would disclose ""sensitive, predecisional, and deliberative information.”“Such disclosures have a chilling effect on the deliberations within the Executive Branch,” Vought wrote. “Indeed, these disclosure provisions have already adversely impacted the candor contained in OMB’s communications with agencies and have undermined OMB’s effectiveness in supervising agency spending.“Moreover, apportionments may contain sensitive information, the automatic public disclosure of which may pose a danger to national security and foreign policy.""A ‘brazen move’Democrats in Congress sharply criticized the decision, with a few calling on the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, to investigate. House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., issued a joint statement in late March urging Vought to reverse course.“Congress enacted these requirements over a Democratic President’s objections on a bipartisan basis because our constituents, and all American taxpayers, deserve transparency and accountability for how their money is being spent,” DeLauro and Murray wrote. “Taking down this website is not just illegal it is a brazen move to hide this administration’s spending from the American people and from Congress.”Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, the top Democrats on the Budget committees, urged the Government Accountability Office to look into the matter.GAO General Counsel Edda Emmanuelli Perez did and wrote in a letter released earlier this month that OMB’s decision to withhold publicly sharing the apportionment information was “very concerning.”“We understand that OMB took down the website taking the position that it requires the disclosure of predecisional, and deliberative information,” he wrote. “We disagree.”Perez rejected OMB’s argument that all of the information had to be removed since “apportionments may contain sensitive information which, if disclosed publicly automatically, may pose a danger to national security and foreign policy.”“While there may be some information that is sensitive if disclosed publicly, it is certainly not the case that all apportionment data meets that standard,” he wrote. “Where there is such sensitive data that should be protected from public disclosure, those would be the exception and should not serve to take down the entire database.”Lawsuits want public info restoredThe two lawsuits — Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Office of Management and Budget and Protect Democracy Project v. U.S. Office of Management and Budget — ask federal judges to require OMB to post the information online once again.CREW wrote in its filing that OMB posted a public version of the database in July 2022, after Congress required it to do so in a government funding bill.The Trump administration removed that webpage on March 24, though OMB “provided no notice or explanation prior to its removal,” according to the lawsuit.The CREW lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and assigned to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton.Protect Democracy Project wrote in its lawsuit that the “laws requiring transparency for apportionments make it more difficult for the executive branch to impound funds unlawfully outside the view of Congress and the public.”The Trump administration faces numerous lawsuits stemming from its efforts to block several departments and agencies from spending money appropriated by Congress, also known as impoundment.The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 bars the executive branch from holding onto money instead of spending it as directed by Congress. But Vought has said several times he believes the law is unconstitutional.Protect Democracy Project’s lawsuit was also filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, though it hadn’t been assigned to a judge as of Monday afternoon.",,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Courtesy of the Fillmore County Sheriff's Office via the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen has requested a major federal disaster declaration for 27 Nebraska counties related to a March winter storm that disaster response officials estimate did more than $64.9 million in damage.
Pillen sent the request to President Donald Trump for the March 18-19 storms, during which the state’s public utilities suffered the most eligible damage, the most significant of which was to power poles and electrical lines. More than 1,700 poles were downed or destroyed. 
Major roadways closed due to the storm — producing thunderstorms, sleet, high winds and blizzard conditions — including a 160-mile stretch of Interstate 80. 
An estimated 200,000 customers were left without power at the height of the storm, and some communities established emergency shelters to help those without electricity for a prolonged time.
In his letter to Trump, Pillen described the March storm as “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history” and wrote that “emergency services were pushed to their limits.” This is Pillen’s first federal disaster declaration request for 2025.
A disaster declaration would open up federal funding to help cover costs in the following counties: Boone, Burt, Butler, Cass, Clay, Colfax, Cuming, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Hamilton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nuckolls, Otoe, Platte, Polk, Saline, Sarpy, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Thurston, Washington, Webster and York.
Pillen requested and was granted five federal disasters in 2024 under President Joe Biden:

April 6-7: Severe wintry storm and straight-line winds; $38 million estimated preliminary damage.
April 25-27: Severe storms, straight-line winds and tornadoes; $20 million estimated preliminary damage.
May 20 – June 3: Severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding. $12 million estimated preliminary damage.
June 19 – July 8: Severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding: $15 million estimated preliminary damage.
July 31: Severe storms , straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding: $35 million estimated preliminary damage.

Pillen signed a state-level disaster declaration in February for wildfires in Custer and Dawes County.

Greg Lopez is launching another bid for Colorado governor.
The Republican who spent six months representing Colorado’s 4th Congressional District in Congress last year has run for governor twice before, losing in primary elections in both 2018 and 2022. 
Lopez became a self-described “placeholder” in Congress following former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck’s resignation in March 2024. Shortly afterwards, a small committee of Republican Party members nominated Lopez to finish Buck’s term, and he went on to defeat Democrat Trisha Calverese in the June special election. GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Windsor won election to a full term representing the 4th District in November.

“My whole life, I’ve been a listener, a problem solver, a fighter for the people,” Lopez said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “I’m running to fix what’s broken and bring people together. Not as a Republican governor. But a Colorado Governor.”
Lopez also previously served as mayor of Parker. He said he will run a statewide “People Over Politics” tour starting later in April, named for his campaign mantra.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has been in office since 2019, is term-limited in 2026. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running on the Democratic side of the race. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election, and Polis won reelection in 2022 by nearly 20 percentage points.
In 2018, Lopez placed third in a four-way GOP primary won by then-State Treasurer Walker Stapleton. He then narrowly lost a head-to-head primary contest against former University of Colorado Regent At-Large Heidi Ganahl in 2022, winning 46% of the vote to Ganahl’s 54%.
Other Republican candidates to announce a 2026 run for governor include state Sen. Mark Baisley, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell and Brighton Fire Chief Brycen Garrison, among several others. 
Lopez hinted that his name would appear on the Colorado ballot in 2026 in a November interview with Newsline.

Adam Hollier (D-Detroit) | Ken Coleman photo Former State Sen. Adam Hollier (D-Detroit) announced on Monday that he would once again seek to represent the state’s 13th congressional district, throwing down the gauntlet against U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit).
In his announcement, Hollier sharply criticized Thanedar, who is serving his second term in Congress. 
“From housing to daycare to the rising costs of everything from groceries to the brakes on our cars, we’re in a real crisis in this country,” said Hollier. “We need bold solutions and leaders who won’t back down in the face of this challenge. The last thing we need are more millionaires and billionaires like Elon Musk and Shri Thanedar who are only in it for themselves.”
Thanedar, who spent $10 million of his own funds seeking the governor’s seat in 2018, served one term in the Michigan Legislature from 2021 through the end of 2022. He was elected to Congress for the first time that year, winning reelection in 2024.
Hollier served in the state Senate from 2018 through the end of 2022. He served as the Director of the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency from January to October of 2023. Hollier is also a team chief and paratrooper in the 412th Civil Affairs Battalion, Army Reserve. 
The two previously squared off in the 2022 Democratic primary, with Thanedar receiving 28.3% of the vote and Hollier receiving 23.5% of the vote.
While Hollier sought to unseat Thanedar in 2024, he was disqualified from the primary after Thandedar challenged his petitions to appear on the ballot. In her review, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett found only 863 of the 1,553 signatures he submitted were valid, leaving Hollier 137 signatures short of the 1,000 needed to qualify for the ballot.
After he was disqualified from the ballot, Hollier said the circulator he’d brought on to collect signatures had let him down, but that as the leadership of the campaign fell to him, he must hold himself to a higher standard.
In announcing his candidacy for 2026, Hollier amplified criticism of Thanedar, pointing to an investigation from the Detroit News which found Thanedar had spent $930,000 in taxpayer funds in 2024 TV, radio, billboards and other advertisements to promote himself as he faced challengers from several other Democrats heading into the primary election last year. 
“It’s absurd. While everyday Michiganders are struggling, Shri Thanedar is spending hundreds of thousands of their hard-earned tax dollars putting up self-portraits of himself all over the district,” Hollier said in a statement. “That’s something only Donald Trump would be proud of.”
Thanedar told the News the ads were unrelated to his reelection campaign  and were intended to generate calls from constituents who need help from the federal government.
On Monday, Thanedar defended his record in a statement to the Michigan Advance.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Since my election, we’ve solved over 2800 constituent cases, recovered nearly $3 million for constituents, gotten $30 million approved in community projects, and sponsored and cosponsored 810 different bills. We have world class constituent communication, including a record 11 in-person town halls,” Thanedar said before blasting Hollier for his previous failure to qualify for the ballot.
“Congressional candidates have the simple task of getting 1,000 qualified signatures to get on the ballot. Voters in the 13th District, 30% of whom are at or below poverty, have serious problems they need addressed. They are looking for someone competent and qualified, not someone who will hire his friends and disastrously fail to accomplish simple tasks,” Thanedar said.

In his announcement, Hollier called for aggressive action from the federal and state government to build new affordable housing across the region and crack down on corporations gouging buyers and renters on housing costs. 
He also pledged to fight for investments to lower the costs of childcare and a repeal of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. If elected, Hollier also promised he would work to make it easier for Michiganders to start small businesses and cut taxes on the poor and the middle class.
As one of the two U.S. representatives whose districts encompass Detroit, the race for the 13th District is considered vital for representation of the predominantly Black city. Detroit elected its first Black U.S. representative, Charles Diggs Jr., in 1954, and consistently elected a Black representative up until 2022, when voters elected Thanedar, who immigrated from India, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who is Palestinian American, to Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. 
While Hollier, who is Black, did not make the ballot in 2024, Thanedar’s Democratic challengers included Lawyer Shakira Lynn Hawkins and Detroit City Council Member Mary Waters who are both African American.

(Photo by Getty Images)More New Mexicans will be able to receive treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, thanks to a first-in-the-nation requirement for some health insurance plans to cover the costs.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on April 7 signed into law House Bill 233, which requires state-regulated health insurance plans to pay for medically necessary treatments for diabetic foot ulcers starting in 2026.
In a news release on April 8, the American Diabetes Association applauded the new law and said it makes New Mexico the first U.S. state to require state-regulated health insurance plans to cover these treatments.
Diabetes-related foot ulcers affect approximately 15 to 25% of all people with diabetes at some point in their lifetime, the ADA said in the news release, and 15% of people with a diabetes-related foot ulcer will require an amputation.
In New Mexico, approximately 217,400 adults, or 13.1% of adults in the state, have diagnosed diabetes, with an estimated 9,800 adults receiving the diagnosis each year, according to the state Department of Health’s analysis of HB233.
Diabetic foot ulcers can lead to loss of the ability to walk, infection, hospitalization, lower-extremity amputation and death, according to a review article in the ADA’s journal Diabetes Care.
Christine Fallabel, the ADA’s director of state government affairs, told Source NM that people with these ulcers have found that insurance does not cover the specialized podiatric treatments to fight the infection and save the foot.
Other states have not tried to introduce similar legislation, Fallabel said, because there is a lot of stigma around diabetes and foot health, and policymakers generally don’t know about the problem.
Fallabel, who has lived with Type 1 Diabetes for the last 25 years, said one of those treatments, called topical oxygen therapy, has resulted in a 71% reduction in amputations, an 88% reduction in hospital visits and a six times higher likelihood of healing within three months, she said.
“There’s really good data coming out about targeting diabetic foot ulcers with this high-pressure oxygen therapy that, until this bill was signed, most insurers wouldn’t cover for one reason or another,” Fallabel said.
Other services that podiatrists could try and would be covered by health insurance under the new law could also include antibiotics or physical therapy, Fallabel said.
State-regulated health insurance plans include a range of private health insurance plans managed by the state government, Fallabel said. It does not include Medicare or Medicaid patients, she said.
Some state Medicaid programs cover these kinds of treatments but New Mexico’s does not, Fallabel said. During the recent legislative session, some lawmakers expressed interest in returning in a future session to change the Medicaid program to cover these treatments too, she said.

Parts of the floor were water-damaged, and after more than 50 years of housing low-income residents, wear and tear on the building was becoming impossible to ignore. 
In October, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development gave the building’s nonprofit owner a $3.8 million grant to pay for needed repairs and upgrades, including a new heating system and windows.
But the money never came through because the Trump administration has “permanently frozen” the funds, CommonBond Communities president and CEO Deidre Schmidt said Monday. 
The grant money came from HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, which provided grants and loans to finance energy efficiency upgrades at affordable housing developments nationwide. Vista Village was the only Minnesota-based project to receive an award through the competitive program.

Congress authorized $1 billion for the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In March, the Associated Press reported that the program was being “terminated” at the direction of DOGE.
Communication about the “permanent freeze” has been confusing and contradictory, said Sen. Tina Smith, who joined Schmidt and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter for a press conference at Vista Village Monday.
Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close advisor to President Donald Trump, has directed federal agencies to cancel funding related to climate change mitigation.
“What’s going on here is actually a massive power grab, and a big money grab, because their plan is to scoop up all of this money and then use it so that they can pay for the tax cuts that they have planned for really wealthy individuals and big corporations,” Smith said. 
Vista Village resident Lisa Bennett, a nurse who has lived at the building for nearly seven years, said the repairs to the complex are needed. 
“We’re not asking for no hardwood floors. We don’t want no stainless steel appliances. We don’t want no recessed lighting — just for that grant to come through so that we can get our building together,” Bennett said.

Time is fast running out. And there are no visible signs of progress.
But University of Idaho and University of Phoenix officials insist they haven’t given up on the idea of a partnership.
“We continue to be excited about the proposed affiliation with the University of Idaho and the opportunity to support important educational and workforce needs in the state of Idaho,” University of Phoenix spokeswoman Andrea Smiley said in an email to Idaho Education News last week. “The two universities will continue to collaborate to find solutions.”
“We continue to see incredible value in University of Phoenix,” U of I spokeswoman Jodi Walker told EdNews in an email. “However, next steps are in the hands of Phoenix and its ownership team.”
But the State Board of Education has the U of I on a deadline to close a deal with Phoenix, a for-profit online university serving some 85,000 students. That deadline, June 10, is quickly approaching.
And what’s more, the State Board agreed to an extension in order to give the two universities time to win over skeptical legislators. And that hasn’t happened — at least not publicly.
The 2025 legislative session came and went without a Phoenix bill, a committee hearing, or any kind of vote. That silence stood in a stark contrast to the 2024 session. The Legislature stymied the $685 million Phoenix deal — with the Idaho Senate killing a bill that would have restructured the purchase — after lawmakers complained that they had been left in the dark by the parties’ closed-door negotiations.
In short, U of I and Phoenix officials now have less than two months to settle on a deal to meet the State Board’s deadline. And with the Legislature adjourned until January, it isn’t clear how lawmakers would have a chance to weigh in on a revamped deal — unless they returned to Boise for a special session.
In the meantime, as the U of I suggests, the next move belongs to Phoenix.
The State Board’s extension also gave Phoenix the latitude to talk to other would-be buyers. Phoenix is continuing to explore “other transaction opportunities,” Smiley said.
One option could involve going public.
As Bloomberg reported in March, Phoenix’s ownership groups are considering an initial public offering, perhaps as early as the third quarter of 2025.
And what about the State Board — which has the U of I on the clock?
The State Board did not respond to a request for comment.
The board meets Wednesday and Thursday at the U of I. And while U of I President C. Scott Green is expected to address the board and deliver the university’s annual report, the board has no Phoenix-related item on its agenda.

Citing existing legal precedents, U.S. Circuit Judge Elizabeth L. Branch wrote in the unanimous opinion that First Amendment protections of speech apply to the act of begging.
“Thus, the begging statute’s applications, which are solely to begging, are impermissible, and the pedestrian solicitation statute’s applications, which are to begging and other constitutionally protected speech, are impermissible,” Branch stated in her opinion.

Messages were sent to Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, the defendant in the lawsuit. Messages were also left with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which represented the state, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which represented plaintiff Jonathan Singleton, and others in the suit.
The initial lawsuit challenged two statutes. The first prohibits a person from standing on the highway and asking those in a vehicle for money, a job or other “business.” Violating that statute is punishable by up to 10 days in jail and a $100 fine.  The second prevents people from loitering in public spaces “for the purpose of begging,” which carries a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $200 fine.
Singleton was cited six times for allegedly violating the laws in Montgomery.
A lower court ruled in Singleton’s favor in March 2023 and issued a permanent injunction against ALEA’s enforcement of the law. The agency appealed the lower court decision to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center, who represented Singleton and the individuals affected, and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office argued the case before a panel of three judges with the 11th Circuit in December.
Alabama Deputy Solicitor General Robert Overing argued in court that begging specifically is not protected speech based on the First Amendment and that the state could regulate the activity and impose penalties on those who violate rules set by the government.
He cited a law passed in the state of New York in 1788 and an action by former President James Madison in 1812 to penalize those who loitered in public spaces.
The Southern Poverty Law Center cited Smith v. Fort Lauderdale, a 1999 decision by the 11th Circuit that upheld a local law banning panhandling on part of a sidewalk, but said that panhandling laws must be narrowly tailored to avoid infringing on the First Amendment. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals then applied that same standard to other cases involving panhandling.
The Alabama Legislature revised the statute concerning begging in public places during the 2023 session by approving HB 24, sponsored by Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, that  makes the first arrest for loitering a violation and subsequent infractions a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.

“Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year. Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu in a release.
Hsu added that the drop was “pervasive and unanimous” across multiple factors including age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation. 
The index is published monthly by the university, and is an indicator of consumers’ confidence in the health of the U.S. economy.
The results, released Friday, came just two days after President Donald Trump reversed course on sweeping tariffs on imported goods, pausing them for 90 days, while keeping in place an across-the-board 10% duty as well as separate tariffs on specific commodities. 
While the university’s survey concluded the day before Trump’s announced pause, Hsu said the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has been increasing for five consecutive months and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since the Great Recession. 
“This lack of labor market confidence lies in sharp contrast to the past several years, when robust spending was supported primarily by strong labor markets and incomes,” said Hsu. 
Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told business journalists at a speech in Virginia that while there was a “still solid” outlook on economic growth, surveys of households and businesses reported “dimming expectations and higher uncertainty” in reaction to Trump administration policies, especially as they related to trade. 
The University of Michigan survey noted that inflation expectations for the coming year “surged from 5.0% last month to 6.7% this month,” which was the highest reading in nearly 45 years. That rise was also seen across the political spectrum. 
“Long-run inflation expectations climbed from 4.1% in March to 4.4% in April, reflecting a particularly large jump among independents,” said Hsu.

(Photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Gov. Glenn Youngkin dubbed April 14-19 Virginia Screen-Free Week, which the governor’s administration encourages citizens of all ages to observe by reducing their time on digital devices and increasing activities that promote human connection, physical activity and improved mental health.
Virginia Screen-Free week includes resources and activity guides for parents and children, schools and communities and is an extension of the work Youngkin and lawmakers have undertaken to counter the negative impacts excessive social media and screen time can have on developing minds. 
“By reducing distractions and supporting healthier screen use, we are creating space for deeper learning, stronger relationships, and more meaningful engagement—both in and out of the classroom,” Education Secretary Aimee Rogstad Guidera said in a Monday release about Virginia Screen-Free Week .
 Lawmakers respond to growing data on youth phone use

A 2023 Gallup survey revealed that teens who spend five or more hours per day on social media apps were more likely to report negative emotions compared to those who use social media less than two hours a day. In response, Youngkin launched initiatives to encourage and enforce time away from phones in classrooms, which the administration said can offer students a few hours most days to focus on their studies instead of their devices. 
The governor’s Executive Order 43 established the Reclaiming Childhood Task Force, which analyzed social media and screen times’ role in mental health, while last summer’s Executive Order 33 directed state agencies to draft guidance for how schools could implement cell phone-free policies.
Youngkin signs executive order to establish ‘cell phone-free education’ in Va. public schools

Virginia lawmakers introduced legislation this year to allow local school boards flexibility over how cell phones and smart devices are governed in classrooms. Youngkin has since signed the bills, carried by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke and Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax. 
Rasoul told The Mercury in February that the legislation enables age-appropriate policies across different schools but has exceptions for students with disabilities that rely on electronic devices to communicate. The proposal also prevents harsh disciplinary measures to ensure that violating the school’s phone policy alone wouldn’t lead to suspensions or expulsions. 
Last week, U.S. Rep. Eugene Vindman, D- Fredericksburg, introduced federal legislation that could take phone-free school policies nationwide, if passed. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt — whose book, “The Anxious Generation,” focused on social media’s connections to youth mental health — provided a statement in the press release about Vindman’s bill.
“Schools that go phone free almost always report increased student engagement, decreased disciplinary problems,” Haidt said. “And, most touchingly, teachers say that they hear laughter in the hallways again.” 
Virginia scholars have weighed in on the family and education benefits of limiting screen use, as well. 
Longwood University professors Sarai and Adam Blincoe enjoy a low-tech lifestyle when it comes to cell phone, laptop or tablet use and are also raising their young children with little screen time. On a cross-country road trip last summer, their kids only watched two movies, they said in an interview. 
Sarai is a psychology professor and Adam is a philosophy professor; their shared interest in how cell phones affect people has infused their work.
In 2021, they published a research paper based on input from their students, who they encouraged to test out a lower-tech lifestyle outside of the classroom while surrendering their devices inside its walls.
Sarai offered students extra credit for disregarding their phones during class time and solicited surveys from them later in the semester. Sixty-five percent of students reported more cognizance of their cell phone use habits as a result, 50% reported how the practice affected cell phone use in other classes, and about 15% reported how the habits carried over to their cell phone use outside of class time.  
“I feel that (functioning cell phone-free) has increased my focus in class,” one student wrote. “Ever since I realized how much more focused I am without my phone … I have found myself leaving my phone in my backpack or sometimes in my dorm room.”
Meanwhile, Adam’s research tested student responses to device-free time outside of classroom environments. Students were required to pick a novel to read in book form, rather than on a device. Students shared that the exercise reminded them of the joy of reading in particular, but also encouraged them to carve out leisure time more broadly. Adam also required students to take three 20-minute walks without their phones per week. 
“I witnessed genuine relief when students realized that they had permission to opt out of the phone even for small periods of time,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)On the eve of another Florida House hearing on the workings of Hope Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday accused House Republicans of working with the “liberal media” in a smear campaign against First Lady Casey DeSantis and the Hope Florida Foundation.
DeSantis unsolicited made the accusations during a Kissimmee press conference following a Miami Herald/ Tampa Bay Times story that the non-profit organization affiliated with Hope Florida paid $5 million a piece to two organizations that contributed to a political committee that worked to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana. 
The $10 million payment to the two groups mirrors the amount the Hope Florida Foundation received from health care giant Centene as part of a settlement regarding overpayment of Medicaid pharmacy benefits and services.
“I got to tell you, I’m used to the baseless smears from liberal media. I’m used to the baseless smears from Democrats. I’ve been dealing with it for over six years. It’s par for the course. But I think now we have Republican leadership in the Florida House joining with liberal media and joining with Democrats to launch baseless smears against Hope Florida and by extension, myself and the First Lady,” DeSantis said.
Hope Florida was set up by Casey DeSantis as a state effort to work with the private sector and faith-based community to help people relying on government assistance transition — or as the DeSantis administration calls it, “graduate” — to self reliance. 
The DeSantis administration claims 30,000 people have called the Hope Florida hotline for help in getting work and transitioning from government support. The foundation is a direct-support organization for the Department of Children and Families, one of the main agencies involved with Hope Florida.

Florida law requires agencies to notify the Legislature when they enter into settlement agreements, but that did not occur with the Centene agreement, which was signed by former AHCA Secretary Jason Weida (now Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff), Chief Deputy Attorney General John Guard, Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworksy, Department of Health Chief of Staff Cassandra Pasley, and Centene Corp. Executive Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel Christopher A. Koster.
So, at a minimum, the DeSantis administration broke state law, said House Health Care Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Alex Andrade.

Medicaid, the safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled, is funded with state and federal dollars. Which could mean that a portion of the $67 million settlement should have been returned to the federal government if the money was related to a Medicaid overpayment.










This is the murky, corrupt, swamp behavior people hate about politics. This money belonged to the taxpayers of Florida, not to the DeSantis family. Floridians deserve to know that their tax dollars aren't being moved around in a shell game to pay political consultants.


– Rep. Fentrice Driskell


It is not clear that occurred.
“This is the murky, corrupt, swamp behavior people hate about politics. This money belonged to the taxpayers of Florida, not to the DeSantis family. Floridians deserve to know that their tax dollars aren’t being moved around in a shell game to pay political consultants,” Fentrice Driskell, the Democratic leader in the state House, said during a Monday morning press conference.
“No matter your politics, no one wants to see taxpayers dollars ending up in the coffers of a political party, or even the appearance of that happening. We need a full investigation, and I’m glad that the House is pursuing this. We need an accounting of all tax dollars involved here.”
Driskell added: “Now, it’s ironic for a governor who talks about Florida Doge to chase waste and fraud to be caught in the middle of a scandal involving defrauding and wasting taxpayer money. The Legislature deserves better answers than what we got in committee last week.”
Latest battle with the Legislature
House Republicans, too, have questioned the legality of steering money from the settlement with a Medicaid vendor to the Hope Florida Foundation. 
On Tuesday, the House Health Care Budget Committee plans to hear testimony from several people regarding Hope Florida, including the head of the foundation.
Gov. DeSantis hotly objected to the House’s efforts.
“Let me tell you something, none of these Republican leaders got elected on the platform that they were going to launch baseless attacks against the governor and First Lady. That is not why they got elected. Had they run on that, they would have lost their primaries, they would never have been elected in the first place. No, they were elected to continue our success in Florida, to build off the great achievements of the last six years. “
This is the latest salvo in the fight between the governor and the Republican-controlled Legislature, a dispute that seemingly started with the governor’s call for a special session on immigration early this year but that has spun out from there to include disputes on government spending, automobile insurance, access to the courts, and tax policy. DeSantis has pushed the Legislature to eliminate property taxes for homeowners and to pass a proposed constitutional amendment for voters to consider doing that in 2026.
House Speaker Daniel Perez proposed to reduce the state’s sales tax instead, which, if passed, would take effect sooner. The governor countered with a proposal to provide $1,000 rebates to roughly 5.1 million property owners and called on the Legislature to act immediately. The governor’s rebate idea, however, has gotten no traction and does not appear to be under serious consideration.
DeSantis also wanted legislators to pass a bill that would permanently enshrine Hope Florida in the governor’s office. The bill has stalled in the House but is scheduled for its second Senate stop on Tuesday.
DeSantis said the House is working to sabotage his agenda.
“They were elected to cut property taxes, which they refused to do. They were elected to help alleviate and end the condo crisis, which the Florida House has refused to do. They were elected to continue our Florida First agenda. 
“And what are they doing with their actions?” DeSantis asked. “Not only are they trying to sabotage that agenda, but they are stabbing the voters in the back with their behavior. Shame on you in the Florida House and your terrible behavior and leadership questions.”
Meanwhile, Attorney General James Uthmeier, formerly DeSantis’s chief of staff, played down any suggestion of wrongdoing during his own press conference Monday saying there’s “not a problem”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Islanders are once again being asked to share how they feel about life in the Ocean State in this year’s RI Life Index survey.
The collaboration between Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health is now in its seventh year of tracking residents’ views on social and economic factors that influence health, including housing, food security, job opportunities, education, child care and the cost of living.
Respondents are selected randomly and contacted primarily by phone or text message, with some respondents also reached online. Surveys started in March and will run through the end of spring, with results expected to be released in fall. The Siena College Research Institute administers the surveys.
The anonymous surveys were first conducted in 2019 with the goal of aggregating data over time and from diverse communities about how people perceive quality of life in Rhode Island. Since 2020, the survey has placed special focus on social factors of health among Rhode Island’s Black and Latino populations. 
The findings help inform and guide a 14-member coalition of local organizations and public health agencies to provide “thought leadership on viable solutions to the challenges identified” in the survey data, according to the index’s website. Among the coalition members are AARP Rhode Island, HousingWorks RI, Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, the Economic Progress Institute, and the Rhode Island Department of Health. Past survey data has been used in publications by coalition members, like the HousingWorks RI Housing Fact Book and the Rhode Island Community Food Bank’s “2024 Status Report on Hunger in Rhode Island.” 
Blue Cross also uses the data to steer its philanthropic initiatives. 
Respondents are asked questions about their communities and the likelihood of specific experiences within their communities, as well as their direct experiences with housing and food security. Responses are graded on a 100-point scale dubbed the “POP” score, or “percent of the possible” — a measure of how close respondents believe their  community is to an ideal, healthy environment. The overall, statewide POP score in the 2024 survey was 57.
The 2024 survey included 1,946 respondents, with an oversample of Black and Latino Rhode Islanders. Last year’s data also saw improvements in perceptions about access to health care among Black and Latino residents. People living in the four “core” cities of Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, and Woonsocket rated health care, community life, and programming and services for children more positively than in the previous year.

Mike Thompson, right, says the Kansas Legislature failed to deliver on a bipartisan promise to concentrate during the 2025 session on meaningful property tax reform. Here, Thompson speaks with Democratic Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau on the floor of the Kansas Senate in March. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature and Gov. Laura Kelly patted themselves on the back last June after placing into state law a compromise bill slashing income taxes an estimated $1.2 billion over three years.
Senate Bill 1 had broad support with a mere six opponents among 159 legislators voting on the package negotiated by the Democratic governor, Republican Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover and GOP House Speaker Dan Hawkins of Wichita. The focus of that bill was income taxes, but it did raise to $75,000 the exemption on the value of a residence when calculating a taxpayer’s obligation to the state’s property tax levy for public schools.
While 2024 was viewed as the year of the income tax, promises were made by Republicans and Democrats to address property tax reform during the 2025 legislative session. The end of the annual session last week offered evidence the performance of lawmakers on property tax relief was again underwhelming.
“When it came time to lead, both the governor and leadership came up short,” said Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican candidate for governor, said Monday.
He said state lawmakers this session delivered a paltry $25.88 property tax break for the owner of a $150,000 home. That’s not enough to fill the gas tank in many vehicles, cover the cost of a couple sacks of groceries or pay someone to mow a lawn.
Schwab encouraged “every property owner” to respond by challenging their property tax valuation with the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals.
“Kansans expected leadership that would address runaway property tax increases, arrest out-of-control valuations and restore confidence that they can afford the homes they live in — not rent them from the government,” he said.
The Senate did endorse an amendment to the Kansas Constitution imposing a 3% cap on residential property tax valuation increases. That won’t be appearing on statewide ballots, however, because the amendment was never taken up in the House.
“We came here with a mandate,” said Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican. “I’m just disappointed that we end up at the end of this session with no real relief for those homeowners who are facing selling their home or paying their property tax. That’s where we are.”
Lenexa Sen. Dinah Sykes, who serves as Democratic leader of the Senate, drew the same conclusion with a partisan twist. She said progress on property tax reform was minimal, but reminded Kansans that Republicans held supermajorities in the House and Senate. Those two-thirds majorities meant the GOP could pass just about any bill it desired and had numbers to override the governor’s vetoes and place constitutional amendments on the ballot.
“Kansans deserve better than what they got from their Legislature in 2025,” Sykes said. “Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues refused to join us in that effort. Republicans promised Kansans they would deliver property tax relief, but they failed to make good on that promise.”
 
‘Put Kansans first’
Kansas voters were assured by sloganeering candidates during last year’s August primary and November general elections that nothing would stand in the way of meaningful property tax reform in 2025. Voters made it clear they thought property taxes were too high, valuations were rising faster than paychecks and, incredibly, some people on fixed incomes who worked all their lives to have a home of their own were being forced out.
As the legislative session began in January, another layer of political vows emerged about cutting property taxes.
“You expect us to put Kansans first, control the overreach of government and keep our promises — and that is exactly what we intend to do,” Masterson said. “That must begin with property tax relief and reform.”
When the dust settled in April, the Legislature barely scratched the surface on rolling back state property taxes. The governor signed Senate Bill 35, which used general state tax dollars to replace a 1.5-mill state property tax dedicated to government building projects. It was unanimously approved in the Senate and overwhelmingly endorsed in the House 96-26.
The Legislature passed a bill renewing the state’s 20-mill property tax, valued at about $875 million annually, to provide financial support to K-12 public schools. The Legislature could have earmarked state income or sales tax dollars to public schools and trimmed state property tax dedicated to that purpose.
Instead, the Republican-controlled House and Senate placed emphasis on income tax reform by voting to override Kelly’s veto of Senate Bill 269. This so-called income-tax-trigger bill was designed to methodically drop individual and corporate income tax rates to 4%.
“I have proposed and supported tax cuts when they are implemented responsibly and benefit the people of Kansas, especially those who need it most,” Kelly said. “This bill ignores Kansas families at a time of rising costs and inflation in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars in giveaways to corporations and the wealthy.”
The override vote on SB 269 was 87-37 in the House and 30-10 in the Senate. Instead of responding to Kansans’ demands for gradual reduction of property taxes, the Legislature in 2025 ended up dedicating future state revenue surpluses to gradually reducing income taxes.
The Senate did endorse a constitutional amendment that would have set a 3% cap on property taxes starting in 2027, but House GOP leaders said the necessary two-thirds majority to place Senate Concurrent Resolution 1603 before Kansas voters didn’t exist in the House.
Critics of the amendment had argued the limitation would cripple the ability of cities and counties to operate, because municipal government relied heavily on property and sales taxes. The state’s revenue stream includes income, sales and property taxes.
 
‘Very disappointed’
In January, the conservative Kansas Policy Institute highlighted for legislators an opinion poll conducted by SurveyUSA on behalf of the Wichita think tank. It showed 64% of participants were in favor of limits on annual increases in the appraised value of property rather than the current practice of annually resetting appraisals to fair market value.
The poll showed majority support for restraint of property taxes existed in urban and rural regions of the state, said Dave Trabert, a lobbyist with Kansas Policy Institute.
He said 70% of conservatives in the poll were supportive of steps to hold down property taxes, while 67% of moderates and 52% of liberals were on board. Eighteen percent were opposed and the same percentage was uncertain.
“Many homeowners have experienced double-digit property tax increases because local officials took advantage of valuation spikes,” Trabert said.
Rep. Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat often distant from KPI’s perspective on public policy issues, said it was folly to ignore will of the people.
“Our constituents are asking for property tax relief,” said Sawyer, who contended the income tax trigger law would prove to be an obstacle to property tax reform. “We go to a rachet so all of our money above inflation in the future goes to cutting the income tax.”
Some of the Senate’s most right-wing members were convinced the Legislature did a belly flop on property taxes in 2025.
Sen. Virgil Peck, a Republican from Havana, said it wasn’t enough the Legislature worked on income tax policy and ditched the 1.5-mill property tax for building construction.
“I think we could do better when it comes to property tax reductions,” Peck said.
Finally, Wichita GOP Sen. Renee Erickson, said the Legislature’s approach to property tax issues didn’t answer the public’s call for relief.
“I’m very disappointed we did not do more for our constituents on property tax and I hope that we seriously are able to do something next session,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Thompson-and-Faust-Goudeau-3.26.25-Senate-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-14 14:13:07.174779

(Photo: Screenshot from video feed)Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs promised at a Monday morning rally that she would fight for service members who may have to meet new conditions for their votes to count. 
“Those who raised their hand and got first in line to serve their county should not now be first in line to have their votes tossed,” Riggs told the crowd. 
On Friday, the state Supreme Court ordered that thousands of military and overseas absentee voters must submit a photo ID within 30 days of getting a notice. If they don’t, their votes in last fall’s state Supreme Court race will be trashed. 
Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin sued the state Board of Elections seeking to erase votes from service people and civilians living overseas that were cast in four heavily Democratic counties. It was part of Griffin’s larger effort to invalidate votes in the race where Riggs, a Democrat, is ahead. 
Most military and overseas absentee voters use a special electronic portal to cast their ballots,  a method that does not allow them to submit additional documents.
The state Board of Elections had told military and overseas voters they did not need to provide a photo ID. With the court ruling, elections officials would have to collect those photos from voters. 
Riggs asked a federal court judge to freeze action in the case. But District Judge Richard Myers told the state Board of Elections to prepare to act on the state court’s instructions while barring the board from declaring a winner.
Separately, a federal lawsuit filed Monday morning in federal court on behalf of overseas voters seeks to prevent the state Board of Elections from requiring them to supply photo ID. 
Named plaintiffs include Carrie Conley, a military spouse who maintained a legal voting residence in Guilford County and voted from Italy using the online portal. According to the court filing, she found out her vote was being challenged while the vote of a neighbor who maintains a Cumberland County voting residence was not challenged. 
Lockhart Webb was living in Switzerland when she voted and found out on April 5 she was on Griffin’s challenge list, according to the court filing. She fears she won’t receive notification of steps she would have to take based on new rules because she and her husband are in the process of returning to North Carolina and won’t have a fixed address. 
Ella Kromm, a Durham resident who voted while teaching in Spain, is also a plaintiff.
The Board of Elections “cure” process selectively imposes additional burdens on some voters and not others, the lawsuit said. 
“Presumptively invalidating votes cast by eligible, qualified voters who complied with all rules and requirements in place at the time of the 2024 elections—and then requiring those voters to jump through additional hoops months after the election to have their ballots counted equally in deciding the Seat Six race—is fundamentally unfair, unduly burdensome, and wholly arbitrary,” the suit said. 
At the rally, state Senator Val Applewhite, a 20-year Air Force veteran, said Republicans are disrespecting military voters. 
“You ask for fairness,  you ask for respect. And above all, you expect for your vote to count,” she said. “Today, we’re watching Republican politicians try to silence the very people who fight for our democracy.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-14-at-10.25.48-AM-1024x583.png,,,2025-04-14 14:13:07.174779

The Legislature has occupied the current Statehouse, the old Highway Building, since 1986. The building, meant to be temporary to allow renovations to the Alabama State Capitol to proceed, has mold and other issues that led the Legislature in 2023 to approve construction of a new facility.

When completed, the Statehouse will be the first new one built in the nation since 1977.
Givhan, seemingly joking, said there could be a raffle for people to participate in the demolition, but that would be determined later.
“We may also raffle off tickets to get people with sledge hammers, like you used to do with old cars to beat them up a little,” he said. “This gives us the right to do that.”
The bill also allows the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate to sell furniture that will not be used in the new building. Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile, carries a companion bill in the House, which has yet to be seen in the House State Governmental Affairs Committee.
Givhan’s bill will now be considered by the full Senate.

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier offered Monday to provide six prosecutors from his office to assist in Florida’s Ninth Judicial Circuit, where State Attorney Monique Worrell recently announced new policies to manage a backlog of more than 13,000 cases.
Saying Worrell had refused to prosecute at least 90 cases in the past week, Uthmeier said, “We’re going to tell her the words that no George Soros prosecutor wants to hear: We’re from the Attorney General’s office, and we’re here to help you.”
“So, the calvary’s here,” he added. “We’ve got the entire team of prosecutors that we’re going to be sending to help out. We hope that she will take that help. We want to get rid of that backlog and those thousands of cases that we want to make sure that dangerous people are put behind bars. We want to see bad guys go away.”
Worrell did ask Uthmeier last week for funding to bring in 13 more prosecutors to address the backlog of non-arrest cases that is now up to 13,675, according to WFTV in Orlando.
That request followed her announcement of a new policy that requires local law enforcement to make an arrest or issue a notice to appear in court before they submit a case to her office for prosecution — comments Uthmeier criticized as “blanket policies” that “are contrary to the essential duties of a prosecutor.”
Worrell, a Democrat, campaigned and won office for the first time in 2020 in part by promising criminal justice reform in her circuit, which encompasses Orange and Osceola Counties. Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended her in August 2023, alleging she had neglected “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
The move outraged Democrats, and Worrell took her case to the Florida Supreme Court, which voted 6-1 to uphold her suspension. However, running in liberal Orange and Osceola, she won a second term in November, beating NPA candidate Andrew Bain (appointed by DeSantis to replace her) by 15 percentage points.
Nick Cox, who serves as statewide prosecutor in the attorney general’s office, said during Monday’s press conference that if Worrell takes in the state prosecutors, they would act under her authority.
“We will try to determine how these cases would typically be handled in the Ninth Circuit but, at the same time, we’re going to bring to bear our opinions and our judgements on the cases, working with the state attorney’s office,” he said.
Despite his comment referring to Worrell as being funded by Soros, Uthmeier insisted his actions were not politically motivated.
“We’re not running around the state looking for people to remove from office,” he said. “We’re looking for people who aren’t doing their job. And, as a prosecutor, your job is simple: Put the bad people away and keep Floridians safe. It’s that simple.
“If you’re willing to do that, I’ve got no beef with you. I want to help you. I want to help everybody. Democrat, Republican, if you are a prosecutor your job is to put bad people away.”
‘Inaccurate and uninformed’
Worrell and Uthmeier have sparred in just the last week.
Speaking at a news conference in Tampa last Monday to announce arrests in a child pornography ring, Uthmeier said that one of the people arrested “was on a lighter probation sentence by the state attorney over in Orlando,” citing it as an example of a prosecutor who “go soft on crime.”
However, the individual to whom he referred, Frankie Pineiro, was prosecuted in a different jurisdiction and before Worrell was elected in 2020.
“The Attorney General is once again inaccurate and uninformed,” Worrell said in a statement issued last week.
“A simple review of public records established that not only was this individual sentenced prior to my election in 2020, but also that this case did not come out of the 9th Judicial Circuit. Since the Attorney General has stated that he will be looking at my conduct going forward to make sure we are enforcing the rule of law, I hope that he will prioritize public safety and also look at my request for additional prosecutors to support our enforcement of the rule of law.”
Throughout last year, DeSantis refused to comment about the possibility of suspending Worrell a second time if she won re-election. Speaking Monday in Kissimmee, which is part of Worrell’s jurisdiction, the governor said he would do so if there was proof that she was neglecting her duties.
“You do not have the ability to pick and choose which laws you’re going to enforce,” he said. “You don’t have the ability or the authority to let the inmates run the asylum. So I know the attorney general is keeping a close eye on what she’s doing. That could end up on my desk if there’s proof that somebody is neglecting their duties or satisfying one or the other provisions of the Florida Constitution, then obviously I could act again.”
As of early Monday afternoon, Worrell’s office had not responded to Uthmeier’s offer. We will update this story when and if she does.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina will appeal FEMA’s decision to end their 100% cost-share for Hurricane Helene debris cleanup and emergency services, Gov. Josh Stein said Monday.
“We were granted 30 days to appeal, which we will surely do,” Stein said during a Monday meeting of his advisory committee on western North Carolina.
The “uncertain” future of FEMA under the Trump administration, he added, combined with the president’s tariffs, would likely further complicate recovery in the mountains.
“The only thing we know for sure is the costs of recovery are going to go up, potentially dramatically,” said Stein, a Democrat.
President Donald Trump has put a 90-day pause on the vast majority of planned tariffs that had spurred chaos in the global markets. But he kept a 10% rate on all nations except China, and has floated additional tariffs on specific industries.
The resulting increased costs on materials are likely to be felt in western North Carolina, where rebuilding has already cost billions and is expected to take years.
“I continue to urge Congress and the White House to appropriate additional funds at a meaningful level,” Stein said.
FEMA: Less cost-sharing, canceled programs and slow-moving cash
FEMA’s decision Friday canceled the agency’s agreement to reimburse the state for 100% of costs on removing debris and emergency services.
It is far from a total departure of the agency from western North Carolina — federal money and resources continue to flow into the region. But the ruling does represent yet another Washington-based hurdle for state officials to find a way around as they try to rebuild.
FEMA’s recent decision to end a grant program focused on building resilient infrastructure will result in around $184 million in losses for North Carolina. Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s task force for Helene recovery, said it ranked eighth among states using the program’s money.

“Those are not immediate repairs,” Calabria said Monday. “And that is an impact for us going forward.”
In a statement announcing its shuttering, a FEMA spokesperson called the program “wasteful” and “ineffective,” and said it prioritized “political agendas.” Any unsent money for the program will be clawed back by the federal government.
The agency has not made a public statement on its denial of cost-sharing in North Carolina as of Monday.
Calabria said an additional $150 million in disaster aid had been pledged by FEMA but has yet to be sent.
“Reimbursements have been slow to come through,” he said.
FEMA and state officials are communicating “almost on a daily basis” as they work to get money flowing to the region, where local governments are facing fiscal cliffs due to damages and lost revenue.

Morning Consult’s latest poll comes a little over a month after McKee announced his intention to seek reelection in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Campaign spokesperson Mike Trainor did not immediately respond to request for comment.
No doubt about it, Gov. McKee is running for reelection

Just ahead of McKee in unfavorability is Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who has a 42% disapproval rating. Maine’s Janet Mills, a Democrat, saw 44% of respondents in her state disapprove of how she’s handling the job.
Kim Reynolds, a Republican from Iowa, has the highest disapproval rating from residents, at 49%. Reynolds announced Friday she would not seek re-election in 2026.
Republican Phil Scott of Vermont holds the highest approval rating of any governor in the nation, with 75% of state residents viewing him favorably.
Connecticut’s Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s approval rating was at 62%, with 30% of respondents disapproving. Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey’s approval rating was at 58%, while 29% disapproved.
New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte, a Republican elected in November, has a 49% approval rating. After just three months in office, 31% disapprove of how she’s doing the job.
The last time McKee’s approval rating was higher than 50% was in the second quarter of 2023, according to Morning Consult’s polling data. At the time, McKee saw 52% approval, with 33% of respondents holding unfavorable views.
His highest approval – 60% –came in the third quarter of 2021, just a few months after he became governor following Gina Raimondo’s appointment as U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Joe Biden’s administration.

Grant Green, R-Wellston, who co-authored the bill with Rep. Brad Boles (R-Marlow).
It now heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), which oversees abandoned wells, reported in January it had at least 20,000 known sites statewide. The wells can leak liquid into nearby water or release methane, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.
“There’s been a real concerted effort to clean this state up with shut-ins, abandoned, orphaned, however you want to categorize them, and I just encourage us to keep moving forward,” Green said during the meeting. “And I mean, the number just changes all the time since I’ve been up here. But one thing that hasn’t changed, it’s growing. So we need to get a handle on it.”
Although the state keeps an estimate of the wells, it’s impossible for it to have a definitive list because many of the wells are in rural areas, a spokesperson for the OCC told StateImpact earlier this year.
Another bill passed by the committee would keep the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board (OERB) funded through 2031. House Bill 1031 is authored by Rep. Gerrid Kendrix (R-Altus) and Sen. Micheal Bergstrom (R-Adair). That bill is now headed to the Senate floor.
The board restores land around plugged abandoned wells using a 1% voluntary tax on oil and gas producers. According to the OERB, at least 20,000 sites have been cleaned up using the fund. The organization also promotes pro-oil and gas education in Oklahoma classrooms through its “HomeRoom” initiative.

It’s been more than six months now since Hurricane Helene devastated much of western North Carolina, and while there’s been a great deal of heroic recovery and rebuilding effort at all levels of government since then, recent actions in Washington are raising red flags in many corners.
At the North Carolina General Assembly, for example, lawmakers like Wake County state Rep. Maria Cervania have expressed deep concern that big Trump administration budget and staffing cuts to federal agencies, along with big price hikes caused by new Trump tariffs will wreak further havoc in the region. And recently NC Newsline caught up with Cervania from her Legislative Building office to discuss her concerns for western North Carolina, as well as her take on some other front burner issues – including the shape of our state employee workforce, the right’s crusade against diversity, and her efforts to reduce nicotine use by kids.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The full Nebraska Legislature appears likely to debate a governor-backed bill to reexamine contributions for school employees’ retirement plans, which the sponsor described as a “win-win-win.”
The Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee on Monday morning voted 4-0 to advance Legislative Bill 645 by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, the committee chair. State Sens. Brian Hardin of Gering and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln were absent from the vote, but Ballard left the vote open through at least the end of the day for both to weigh in if they choose to.
“This is a win for state tax dollars, a win for teachers and also, I believe, a win for property taxpayers as well,” Ballard told the Nebraska Examiner of his amended bill.
State contributions and funding
The school retirement plan at center stage applies to eligible school employees outside of the Omaha Public Schools, which has a separate retirement plan.
Currently, teachers and other eligible school staff contribute 9.78% of their monthly payroll to the pooled retirement plan. School districts match this at 9.88% of the amount they pay their employees, while the state contributes 2% of statewide school employee payroll each year.

The estimated payroll for teachers in Nebraska, as of July 1, 2024, was $2.5 billion annually. That means the plan took in $543 million in direct contributions — about $50 million from the state, $245 million from employees and $248 million from school districts in the most recent year.
The amended LB 645 is significantly different from when it was introduced in January, which at the time would have reduced state contributions to 0% depending on the plan’s actuarial funding status, but left contribution rates for employees and school districts the same. The plan is currently 99.91% funded.
If LB 645 moves forward, contribution levels of all three groups would change at four stages based on the actuarially funded level — less than 96% funded, between 96% and 98% funded, between 98% and 100% funded and fully funded.
The state would fall to 0.7% of annual contributions at the two intermediate stages, retaining the 2% contribution level when the retirement plan is underfunded and paying zero when the plan is fully funded.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, and a member of the Retirement Committee, said LB 645 could save the state $77 million over the next biennium.
The governor’s office maintains that the freed-up funds should not be used to balance the state’s projected budget deficit but instead to invest in education.
Increased take-home pay
Under the latest version of Ballard’s bill, school employees would contribute 9.75% of payroll if the plan is less than 96% funded. This would lower to 8.75% and 8%, respectively, at the intermediate stages. When fully funded, employees would contribute 7.25% of their individual pay to the plan. Employees were brought to the table for negotiations prior to LB 645’s public hearing last month.
Ballard’s staff provided data estimating that the average school teacher could receive $1,000 in more take-home pay if the retirement plan is more than 98% funded, as it is now, because of lower monthly contributions.
  The following represents the scaling contribution rates that would be in place under an amended LB 645 proposed by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln. (Courtesy of Sen. Beau Ballard)
When the plan is fully funded, take-home pay for the average teacher could rise by up to $1,500 each year.
Employers would continue to contribute 101% of what their employees do, which is a first for the continued negotiations. Before, LB 645 would have locked the employer contribution rate at 9.88% of what employees are paid. Ballard said allowing lowered contributions when the retirement plans are flush could lead to reduced property taxes.
Lowered contributions at full funding would lower contributions for both employers and employees by 2.5%, potentially freeing up funding for a priority of the Nebraska State Education Association — funding more long-term substitutes so teachers can take paid time off around significant life events.
That bill, LB 440 from State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, is planned to be advanced through the Education Committee’s LB 306. An amended version of her bill seeks a 0.35% payroll tax, for both employees and employers, to fund four weeks of long-term substitutes, rather than her original proposal’s idea for six weeks.
Excess funds collected under the Spivey proposal above what’s needed to cover subs would be steered toward teacher retention or recruitment, such as forgivable loans for special education teachers as provided in Lincoln State Sen. George Dungan’s LB 408.
Latest actuarial study
Before structural changes to state retirement plans can be made, an actuarial study must assess the feasibility. The latest study came back last Thursday indicating the plan would still receive about 0.27% more funds each year than required under state law at full funding. The actuaries said this provides “little cushion … to absorb adverse experience.”
State law currently requires that the state is on the hook for additional funding in any given year if the plan requires more funds outside of annual contributions.
The actuaries wrote that part of the “challenge” in the future will be adjusting to the varied contribution rate, which could eat into state funds, property taxes or employee pay.

The study also takes into account a phased-in slightly lower assumed return on investment for the retirement plan. State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, vice chair of the Retirement Committee, said normally contributions would increase in that case. The actuaries agreed this could increase risk to the retirement plan.
However, Ballard and Clements noted that one built-in fail-safe is increased contributions if the funding status of the retirement plan lowers.
The actuaries predicted the probability that the retirement plan would be fully funded about 56.4% of the time over the next 20 years, while it could be less than 96% funded about 31.5% of the time.
‘This is their livelihood’
Ballard, who introduced LB 645 more than 50 legislative days ago, said he appreciated the feedback that he received from teachers, administrators, school boards, the Governor’s Office and more, all of which he said are now on board.
Conrad clashed with Ballard at LB 645’s public hearing in March in part over the bill’s negotiations. She could not immediately be reached for comment Monday on the advanced bill, nor could the NSEA.
Ballard said he took the feedback of teachers and other employees with “high consideration.”
“This is their livelihood, this is their retirement plan,” Ballard said. “We want to make sure that they are protected because they do so much for our state, and we just really appreciate their feedback.”

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will remove gender dysphoria from disabilities protected under federal law, but it’s still unclear whether 17 Republican state attorneys general will continue a related lawsuit that could dismantle federal protections for all people with disabilities.
Last fall, Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over the Biden administration’s addition of a gender identity-related disorder to the disabilities protected under a portion of federal law known as Section 504.
Republican attorneys general from 16 other states joined the lawsuit: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.

But they  faced a swift backlash earlier this year. Disability advocates pointed to parts of their lawsuit that asked the court to find all of Section 504 unconstitutional, not just the update that included gender dysphoria.
If the court agrees, advocates fear that schools, workplaces, hospitals and other entities could refuse to provide disability accommodations they’ve been required to provide for the past 50 years.

AGs hurried to distance themselves. Arkansas Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin, Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and others adamantly denied that interpretation and said their only goal was to remove protections for people with gender dysphoria.
The new HHS ruling seems to achieve what the AGs said they wanted. It essentially declares that the Biden update adding gender dysphoria to disability law can’t be enforced.
But the broad language of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility, some experts say, for the court to strike down the entirety of Section 504 protections.
The state AGs’ position should become clearer in a few days. They’re scheduled to file an update with the court on April 21.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers in the Maine Legislature are trying to restrict the governor’s emergency powers. 
Republicans proposed limiting the governor’s ability to convene the Legislature, in response to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills calling lawmakers into a special session after the Democratic majority made the decision to quickly pass a two-year majority budget that failed to secure two-thirds support. 
Crucial to that plan was the understanding that the Legislature would adjourn, in order to start the clock to release the funding, and immediately get called back by the governor to attend to the remainder of legislative business. 
In addition to the Republican proposal, a Democratic lawmaker has suggested an alternative way to reign in executive reach by requiring legislators to be consulted in emergency decisions. 
When the lawmakers presented their plans to the State and Local Government Committee on Monday, no one from the public testified for nor against. 
Republican proposal
Rep. Joshua Morris (R-Turner) and eight Republican co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor and Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Smith of Palermo, proposed amending the state constitution so that if the Legislature adjourns “sine die”, or finally, the governor can’t reconvene the body for 90 days.
Because it proposes a constitutional amendment, LD 1331 has to be passed by two-thirds of the Legislature and then ultimately be decided by Maine voters through a ballot referendum question.
“I will not attempt to hide the true motivation behind my proposal,” Morris told the committee. “The last three sessions have seen a majority budget passed at the end of March with a sine die adjournment, only to see the Legislature called back immediately.”
The two-year budget was ‘not the last word.’ Here’s what comes next.

The Maine Constitution establishes an adjournment date for the Legislature for both the first and second regular sessions. The end date for the first regular session of the current 132nd Legislature had been June 18 but the body adjourned just after midnight on March 21 before Mills called a special session. There is no statutory limit on the length of a special session.
“The constitution states that the governor may call us back on ‘extraordinary occasions,’ not just to finish the work we haven’t gotten to yet,” Morris said. “For example, calling the Legislature back so we can commemorate official reptiles and amphibians is hardly an extraordinary occasion that can’t wait until the second regular session.”
Several of Morris’ Republican colleagues made similar remarks at the time of those specific votes after the Legislature began its special session on March 25.
Rep. William Tuell of East Machias said on the House floor ahead of the vote one state amphibian that the body should instead be dealing with matters he views as in line with “extraordinary occasions,” such as high property taxes. The Legislature is considering a number of bills on property taxes carried over into the special session.
During the hearing on Monday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of more specifically defining what constitutes an “extraordinary occasion” through LD 1331.
Morris also argued his bill would require more bipartisan consensus on a budget or other laws in order to get them passed in a timely manner without deploying the special session maneuver, as it takes 90 days for bills to take effect if they don’t secure the two-thirds support needed to pass as an emergency. 
Members of the minority party have been vocal about their opposition to the current special session. 
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) has continuously called the session “illegal” and questioned what extraordinary circumstances warranted it in speeches on the House floor and in meetings of the Taxation Committee.
Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) is also leading an effort for a people’s veto of the two-year budget. The referendum needs at least 67,682 signatures from Maine voters by June 18 to put the budget, the funding for which is set to become available at the end of June, on hold until the November election or an earlier statewide special election. 
Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows released the proposed wording for the question last week, which Drinkwater has said he’s disappointed with. 
The proposed question reads: “Do you want to stop most state government operations and programs, including new and ongoing state funding for cities, towns, and schools, by rejecting the state’s two-year budget?”
This is not the first time lawmakers have objected to how the governor has exercised emergency power.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mills adjourned the Legislature, prompting lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to call for her to bring the body back, though Republicans wanted to only address pandemic-related issues during the special session while Democrats wanted to address other unfinished business, as well. 
The Legislature can call itself into a special session without an action by the governor if the majority of the members in each party consent, which could not be achieved in that case. 
Democratic proposal 
Executive emergency power is not vested in the governor by the constitution. Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) told the committee that the Legislature, therefore, has and should assert its authority to be more involved in emergency decisions.
“This bill isn’t about the present chief executive, nor is it about any former or future chief executive,” Lee said. “This bill is about this branch of government, the primary policymaking branch of government, the one closest to Maine citizens, modestly reasserting its role in participating in governance of the state in the event of an emergency.”
LD 1524 would require the governor to consult directly with the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected leaders of legislative leadership, when acting on emergency powers. 
It would also require the executive’s actions to be narrowly tailored to address the specific public health or safety emergency for which the emergency was declared and require court action if the governor’s actions don’t adhere to that standard. 
Specifically, it would provide the Maine Superior Court jurisdiction to issue temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions against executive actions, and in the event one is granted, it gives an expedited appeal to the governor to challenge the injunction to the law court. 
Another way the governor would be required to loop in the Legislative Council would be through a weekly, written briefing detailing all actions taken pursuant to emergency powers and how and whether those actions have helped abate the emergency. 
Lastly, the bill would require three-fifths of the Legislature — 91 representatives and 21 senators — to extend an emergency beyond 30 days.
“While I can understand that in emergency circumstances it is more efficient for a single person advised by talented and intelligent but nevertheless unelected individuals to make decisions for the people,” Lee said, “that efficiency comes at the expense of having these decisions made by the individuals closest to the people.”

Delaware insurance regulators have fined Liberty Mutual $300,000 following an investigation that revealed tens of thousands of misleading advertisements promising discounts that weren’t actually available to state residents.
The Delaware Department of Insurance announced the penalty after a months-long examination of three Liberty Mutual member companies: Liberty Insurance Corporation, Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, and LM Insurance Corporation.
In addition to the $300,000 fine, the companies face a conditional penalty of $200,000 if the misleading practices are not immediately corrected.
The investigation uncovered 39,806 instances of false or deceptive advertising between January 1, 2021, and July 31, 2023.

Most notably, Liberty Mutual advertised “claims-free” discounts on homeowners insurance declaration pages—despite not offering that discount in Delaware.
Similarly, the company promoted auto insurance discounts for vehicles equipped with advanced safety features like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning systems, though those discounts were not available on any Delaware policies.
“When shopping for insurance coverage, Delawareans already have so much to think about, especially in this economy. Our team is dedicated to uncovering misleading advertising and other misrepresentations that could lead to consumers choosing the wrong coverage for their needs, or their wallets,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “We have seen this problem before, and we are committed to ensuring it is corrected.”
The three Liberty Mutual companies currently write more than $59.7 million in insurance premiums in Delaware.
This is not the first time the insurer has faced scrutiny over similar practices. A prior investigation into related Liberty Mutual entities found nearly 35,000 instances of misinformation between 2018 and 2021. At the time, those companies were fined $150,000 each, but continued noncompliance triggered the most recent examination.

Teresa Marie Johnson, 53, of Manilla, who is a state-licensed paramedic, is charged with the felony of unlawfully obtaining a controlled substance through fraud or deceit while working as a licensed paramedic in February 2025.
She also faces five separate counts of misdemeanor prohibited acts related to unlawful possession of drugs. She has yet to enter a plea in the case and is scheduled to be arraigned April 21, 2025.
Police records indicate the alleged thefts occurred while Johnson was working for the Carroll County Ambulance Service.
Separately, the Iowa Bureau of Emergency and Medical Trauma Services has issued an emergency order suspending Johnson’s license as a paramedic. The board alleges her “continued practice of emergency medical services constitutes an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare.”
According to the board, Johnson removed 25 micrograms of fentanyl from each of three different vials and replaced the missing opioid painkiller with normal saline.
In addition, Johnson is also accused of stealing one full vial of fentanyl. All of the vials of fentanyl were located in an ambulance which she helped staff, the board alleges.
In its suspension order, the board claims Johnson admitted gluing the caps back on the vials after the alleged theft.

An EF-3 tornado with a 43-mile storm track swept through the county early April 3, killing five people. Wind speeds reached up to 160 miles per hour.
The storm hit Selmer, the county’s largest city and county seat, home to about 4,500 people. Those killed include three Selmer residents on New Bethel Road, one McNairy County resident on New Bethel Road and one McNairy County resident on Friendship Road, according to the Selmer Police Department.
Residents and business owners bore the brunt of property damage, with preliminary assessments totaling $27.6 million, the McNairy County Emergency Management Agency reported Friday.
Flooding caused by the storm system also damaged roads across the county. The local government response and the cost of damage to public property, roads, utilities, and government facilities totals around $2.7 million.
Of the 332 structures impacted by the storm, 108 were destroyed and 70 sustained major damage, McNairy County EMA reported on April 5.
The preliminary damage assessments will be sent to FEMA, the first step in determining whether McNairy County is eligible for federal assistance with disaster recovery. The Small Business Administration also assessed the damage to determine if the county is eligible for low-interest disaster loans.
A disaster declaration is needed for the county to receive federal aid.
Damage assessments are ongoing.
Tennessee has been under a federal Emergency Declaration since April 2, as severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding slammed West and Middle Tennessee. 
Under the declaration, FEMA can provide equipment and resources to support emergency response, and direct federal assistance under the public assistance program will be provided at 75% federal funding, according to the agency.

(Photo by Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty Images)Mothers in Alaska’s northern and western regions are more likely than other Alaska mothers to give birth to preterm and underweight babies, and their travel from rural Alaska to get care in bigger communities is a factor that contributes to those outcomes, a new study has found.
The study, by researchers at the University of Alaska Anchorage, analyzes the more than 218,000 childbirths recorded in the state from 2000 to 2020. It revealed striking geographic disparities in the rates of preterm and very preterm births, defined respectively as births before 37 and 32 weeks’ gestation, as well as the cases of low birth weight.
Preterm births are associated with numerous health problems, including breathing and heart problems, long-term complications like cerebral palsy and higher rates of sudden infant death syndrome, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The factors that are associated with adverse childbirth impacts are numerous, the UAA study found. They include tobacco use during pregnancy, mothers’ pre-pregnancy diabetes or hypertension, mothers’ ages and a lack of adequate prenatal care.
For many women, the factors associated with adverse impacts are cumulative, said study co-author Micah Hahn, an epidemiologist at UAA’s Institute of Circumpolar Health.
“It’s kind of like a constellation of things that contribute to preterm birth,” Hahn said.  
One important factor for Alaska newborns is their mothers’ need to leave home, the study found.
Nearly 40% of babies born during the two-decade period had mothers who traveled outside of their home communities for childbirth, the study found. That travel is itself a stressor, the study said.
Routine prenatal care for rural Alaska women can also require travel, making such care more difficult to obtain prior to childbirth.
For rural Alaska women, where communities are predominantly Alaska Native, “it takes so much more effort to go to prenatal care,” Hahn said.
Beyond the travel itself, which can be expensive, the women need child care and supportive partners, family members or friends to take on various duties, she said. Those women need extra time as well, she added. In contrast to her experience as an expectant mother in Anchorage, driving a couple of miles to her doctor’s office, women flying in from rural Alaska can take two or three days to get their appointments, she said.
Often, the factors associated with adverse birth outcomes overlap, the study found.
Rural women with more high-risk pregnancies may be directed to travel to cities or hub communities to give birth, while women with low-risk pregnancies may be able to stay home. But travel and the prolonged stays in settings that might be unfamiliar add complications to pregnancies that already may be of higher risk, it said.
“If a mother travels to a service hub for prenatal care or delivery, they will incur costs for flights, accommodation, food, and missed work, which may not be covered by insurance,” the study said “They may need to have difficult conversations about whether their partner will travel with them or stay at home to work and care for other children. These stressors are compounded by a lack of social support and living in an unfamiliar place.”
Improvements, policy ideas and further study
There is good news revealed in the study.
Rates of prenatal care for Alaska Native women have increased in recent years, the study found. By 2020, about 40% of pregnant Native women get at least 11 prenatal visits, a substantial increase from the 2005-2010 period, the study found. In comparison, more than half of pregnant white women had at least 11 prenatal visits in 2020.
“You can see that one good news story is that in Alaska we are closing the gap on prenatal care utilization by race,” Hahn said.
And while babies born to mothers from northern and Western Alaska are more likely to have adverse outcomes than the state average, the rates for those rural women are not worse than the national rate, she pointed out.
About 1 in 10 babies in the United States are born preterm, the study notes. That is about the same as the rates the study found for babies born to northern and Western Alaska women.
Hahn said the study can guide health policies in the state to help women and their babies.
Tobacco-cessation programs can be useful, she said. So could anything that reduces pregnant women’s need for travel or makes travel, when it is necessary, easier and more comfortable.
Telehealth could be used for some prenatal care for rural women, though certain visits would still have to be conducted in person, Hahn said.
A bill pending in the Alaska Legislature, Senate Bill 83, is aimed at making telehealth more available. It would require that insurers fully reimburse health providers for telehealth services.
Other ways to reduce risks of adverse birth outcomes involve holistic approaches that consider rural and Alaska Native needs and cultures, Hahn said.
One organization that has been helpful to that end, she said, is the Alaska Native Birthworkers Community, a network of Indigenous midwives, doulas, breastfeeding consultants and other health experts. The community provides prenatal and postpartum support and education.
Not considered in this new study are environmental factors that may affect birth outcomes.
Those will be addressed in a different study by Hahn and her research partners that is expected to be published later in the year. They are examining the impacts of wildfire smoke on childbirth outcomes.
Wildfire smoke is a well-known health hazard. It has already been shown to increase risks of preterm birth elsewhere, in California and Brazil, for example.
In Alaska, climate change is causing wildfire seasons to become longer and more intense, and wildfire smoke problems in Alaska communities have increased over time, according to University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers.
In Fairbanks, for example, smoke-free summers were common prior to 2000, but those have occurred only twice since then, according to a new report led by UAF’s Alaska Fire Science Consortium. According to the report, titled Alaska’s Changing Wildfire Environment 2.0, Fairbanks for the first time had three consecutive summers, from 2022 to 2024, with at least 100 hours of smoke that was thick enough to degrade air quality.
Hahn said wildfire smoke is not just a Fairbanks or Interior Alaska problem. “Even if that’s where the wildfires are, smoke is affecting most of Alaska during the really bad years,” she said.

Facing a historic funding crisis, SEPTA unveiled a proposed budget Wednesday that would slash nearly half of its service, raise fares, and cut staff. If implemented, the Wilmington/Newark Line would be shut down, along with other major rail services.
The proposal, driven by a looming $213 million deficit for the upcoming fiscal year starting July 1, includes a 45% reduction in service. 
Due to these proposed cuts, the Broad-Ridge Spur would be shut down entirely, along with five Regional Rail lines: the Cynwyd Line, Chestnut Hill West Line, Paoli/Thorndale Line, Trenton Line, and the Wilmington/Newark Line.
“These cuts to SEPTA’s service – which would hurt our economy and make it harder for hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians to get to work, school, and wherever else they need to go – are completely avoidable,” said Governor Josh Shapiro, who has introduced a statewide transit funding plan now stalled in the state Senate. 
“For two years in a row, I have proposed a commonsense plan to support mass transit all across the Commonwealth and last December, I flexed funding to give the legislature more time to come to the table. The state House has passed my proposal three times and plans to do so again next month – it is now squarely on the state Senate to come to the table and pass more funding for mass transit that their own constituents rely on.” 
“SEPTA would go from being the economic driver of this city and region to its limiter,” said SEPTA Board Chair Kenneth E. Lawrence Jr.
“We are grateful for Governor Shapiro’s proposal and for the continued efforts of legislators from our city and region. Now, we all need to hear from the public. Even if you don’t ride, deep service cuts would impact you – whether it is from increased congestion on area roadways, declining property values or less revenue for local businesses as SEPTA purchases significantly fewer supplies and materials.”

SEPTA, like many public transit systems nationwide, has struggled to stabilize after pandemic-era federal relief funding expired. Despite efforts to tighten its belt – including management pay freezes, third-party contract cuts, and a resumed Regional Rail parking fee – the agency still faces mounting pressure from rising costs, inflation, and safety concerns.
“We know how critical service is to our customers and the region, and we have done everything possible to avoid the drastic measures that are proposed in this budget,” said Interim General Manager Scott A. Sauer. “
We have made significant progress in cutting costs, growing ridership, improving reliability and delivering on safety and security enhancements. All of that is at risk if we are forced to start dismantling the system.”
Governor Shapiro temporarily rescued SEPTA last fall by redirecting federal highway funds to close the current year’s gap, but that one-time fix won’t be available again. By law, SEPTA must approve a balanced budget by July 1, and with no legislative relief yet in sight, officials say painful cuts are inevitable.
In addition to its Operating Budget, SEPTA also released its Capital Budget proposal, which outlines delays and deferrals for dozens of infrastructure projects due to limited funding and inflation, including station accessibility upgrades and long-promised improvements.
Public hearings for both budget proposals will take place at SEPTA Headquarters on May 19 and 20 for the Operating Budget, and May 21 for the Capital Budget. 
The SEPTA Board is expected to vote on the final budgets on June 26.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday during a press conference in Kissimmee that Florida could handle emergencies without federal funds but still believes the federal government will grant states money to deal with disasters without oversight.
The governor has advocated for states to receive block grants to operate all aspects of emergency preparation and response over getting assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

“We’ve got a big surplus. We would have to make adjustments to how we approach things, but I can do that, you know,” DeSantis said of the possibility of the Trump administration cutting disaster assistance. “Just let me know what’s in the best interest of the United States and, if it is, then Florida will respond very, very appropriately, but that would obviously require us to change a little bit about what we’re doing.”
However, he emphasized that he doesn’t anticipate Trump would eliminate FEMA without the federal government giving grants to the states. The governor’s comments came after the Trump administration cut nearly $300 million for flooding and hurricane relief projects across the state, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell of Tampa called out the funding cuts during a press conference Monday morning.
“It really breaks my heart that these funds are being cut, because our area was completely devastated by the hurricanes that we saw last fall,” she said. “I know there are other areas of the state that were impacted, and in a time where we are experiencing stronger and stronger hurricanes and stronger natural disasters, it’s not the time to cut FEMA funding, not when our state needs it the most.”
FEMA last year approved more than $1 billion in individual assistance to Floridians following the destruction from Hurricanes Milton, Helene, and Debby. The next hurricane season starts on June 1.

Recent federal government budget and staffing cuts imposed by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency are having devastating impacts in dozens of areas, but one that’s received less attention than it probably deserves is agriculture. As journalist Kevin Hardy of the national news outlet Stateline reported recently, the administration has yanked funding for programs that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms.
Originally funded under the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s local food programs aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers and small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination, while channeling fresh food and produce to schools and food banks. Now the programs are gone and as Hardy told NC Newsline when we caught up with him earlier this week, the damage being inflicted is widespread and deep.

The Edmond Board of Education voted unanimously Monday morning to hire Josh Delich as the next chief executive to lead the district of 25,700 students. On July 1, he will succeed Angela Mills Grunewald, who is soon retiring after four years as superintendent. 
“When you drive around here, you can see the greatness that’s happening here, and I want to be a part of that excellence and continue that,” Delich told reporters after the school board meeting.

The board also voted to contract with Delich on a “daily rate basis” as he visits and consults with the administration as the incoming superintendent. He formally takes office on July 1, but he will begin preparing for the transition right away by traveling back and forth from Minnesota, he said.
Edmond schools didn’t immediately provide details of his contract and salary. Grunewald earns a base salary of $220,000 and $26,700 in additional benefits and compensation.
Delich is an associate superintendent for high schools at the largest district in Minnesota, Anoka-Hennepin Schools north of Minneapolis. The Minnesota district of 38,000 students is known, like Edmond, for academic performance above the state average.
Edmond Board President Courtney Hobgood said Delich delivers not only experience but a “strong heart” for education.
“He brings passion for continuing the forward progress in Edmond and building on our history of success,” Hobgood said after the meeting.

Delich said he will bring “external ideas” to Edmond, Oklahoma’s fourth largest district, but first wants to “listen, learn (and) lead to better understand what’s going on before I start infusing some of the ideas or experiences I have into the system.”
He said he intends to examine ways to improve four key areas: student achievement and outcomes, staff and teacher performance, operational efficiency and effectiveness, and relations with the Edmond community.
Delich said he also hopes to connect with Edmond’s state lawmakers and state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
The relationship between Edmond district leaders and Walters at times has been strained. The district sued the Oklahoma State Department of Education after Walters’ administration tried to order the removal of “The Kite Runner” and “The Glass Castle” from Edmond’s high school libraries.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in Edmond’s favor, deciding local school officials rather than the state decide what books to keep on school library shelves.
“I look forward to meeting Ryan Walters and spending some time, get to know the individual, get to know him, also for him to get to know me and then figure out where to where can we align and where can we best keep moving things forward,” Delich said. “Because I know that if you’re in the world of education, it’s about students and how do we develop and create great opportunities for students.”
Born in Bogotá, Colombia, Delich was adopted and raised in Minnesota. He has 21 years of experience as an educator in his home state and in Texas. He attended Concordia University, St. Paul and then the University of Texas at Arlington for his master’s degree in education. He earned a Ph.D. from the University of North Texas.
Before joining Anoka-Hennepin Schools, Delich was an assistant superintendent at St. Paul Public Schools, the second-largest district in Minnesota.
His wife, Desirae, and their three daughters will relocate with him to Edmond.
Delich said he and his wife had visited Oklahoma before and “could see ourselves someday being here.”
“The amount of welcoming, the genuine sense of belonging that one can get when they get here to Oklahoma is amazing,” he said. “This is a gem of a state.”

Shapiro and his family. It is being investigated as arson. (Photo Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The smell of fire was still strong on the side lawn of the governor’s residence around 5:00 pm on Sunday, hours after an arson attack on the governor’s residence in Harrisburg.
As Governor Josh Shapiro held a press conference to announce an arrest in the incident, he stood in front of a large reception room that had been set up for a Passover Seder. It was blackened and charred. The wreckage could be seen though busted windows and doors.
It was almost unrecognizable from the night before when the governor, who is Jewish, held a Seder for family and friends to mark the first night of the Passover holiday. A photo of the preparation posted to his Facebook page on Saturday showed a Seder plate on a gold table cloth, an open bottle of wine and copies of the Haggadah, a Jewish text about the Hebrews’ exodus from Egypt brought out every year for the holiday.
Hours after the Seder ended, Shapiro said he and his family were woken up by a member of his security detail banging on his door. The state trooper said they had to evacuate immediately. Someone had broken into the residence, set the reception room ablaze with a homemade incendiary device, and was able to get out before being apprehended. According to State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens, the attack appeared planned and methodical.
Shapiro, his wife and children, their two dogs and another family that was staying with them were all evacuated safely. The fire was extinguished.
So far, no motive has been determined, and it’s unclear if the attack was at all related to the holiday or Shapiro’s Jewish heritage, though a suspect, 38-year-old Cody Balmer, is in custody.
Speaking to the press from a podium on the lawn, Shapiro was visibly emotional. He said the event traumatized his family and the governor’s residence staff.
“If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday,” Shapiro said. “If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this: We celebrated our faith last night proudly, and in a few hours we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover.”
“We’ll clean this up, we’ll get it repaired, we’ll get it rebuilt, we’ll get rid of that smell of fire and smoke, and we’ll be back very soon,” Shapiro added. “We’ll be back to welcome the community into this residence.”

Waiting below was Donald Trump.,Kalyn Belsha | Chalkbeat,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/14/maine-pole-vaulter-trans-athletes/,"After a trans athlete in Maine won a state title, the Trump administration moved to withhold the state's K-12 funding.","This story was  originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
The winning pole vault at Maine’s Class B girls’ track and field championship in February missed the state record by 7 inches. But it was high enough to catapult Maine to the top of President Donald Trump’s enemies list.
Two weeks before that competition, Trump had signed an executive order aimed at “keeping men out of women’s sports.” The order threatened to withhold federal funding from any school that allowed athletes assigned male at birth to participate in girls’ or women’s sports.
The pole vaulter who clinched the girls’ state title was a trans athlete from a school district of 1,850 in the suburbs of Portland on Maine’s southern coast.
That same day, a Republican state legislator shared the 10th grader’s picture on Facebook, later calling it “unfair, unsafe, and unacceptable” that she had been allowed to compete. Conservative news outlets boosted the story.
The issue came to a head a few days later at a White House governors luncheon, where Trump told Maine Gov. Janet Mills that she better comply with his executive order or Maine wouldn’t get any federal funding. “See you in court,” Mills replied curtly.
That viral exchange set off a battle over not just who is protected by Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in education, but how far the president can take his aggressive and unusual approach to civil rights enforcement to reshape American education.
The Trump administration launched two overlapping civil rights investigations that rapidly determined Maine had violated Title IX. Maine officials say they are complying with their state’s human rights law, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, and don’t plan to back down. Now the Trump administration is taking Maine to court and moving to strip the state of its K-12 education funding — an unprecedented step.
That move could instill fear in states and schools that have policies similar to Maine’s. Educators and officials could now be wondering if they’ll be the focus of such an investigation themselves, and whether they’re ready to risk hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to hold onto those rules and beliefs.
What’s happening in Maine comes as the Trump administration wages war with numerous colleges and several state K-12 leaders over antisemitism on campus and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, respectively.
Federal officials are conducting at least 18 other investigations into school districts, state education agencies, and state athletics associations over policies involving transgender students, according to a tracker compiled by Education Week. There’s now a Title IX special investigations team tasked with wrapping up investigations quickly and preparing them for litigation.
Those backing the Trump administration’s actions say the president’s position — far from being radical — is supported by the law, common sense, and the general public.
Teresa Manning, the policy director at the National Association of Scholars, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative education policies, said the phrase “on the basis of sex” in Title IX should be interpreted by its “plain meaning” that there are two sexes, male and female, and those don’t change.
“What the Trump administration is doing is simply maintaining the status quo of how Title IX has been interpreted for 50 years,” Manning said. “It’s not like the executive orders are anything new.”
Seth Galanter, who served in the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights during the Biden and Obama administrations, said a big reason the Maine case matters is how it will “affect trans athletes and their lives, and their ability to participate in sports.”
But he also believes the outcome of the dispute matters for all kinds of students.
“This is really an administration that is trying to bully people and schools to do what they want by discarding all the protections and norms that usually accompany a civil rights investigation,” said Galanter, who worked in the Education Department until January. “If they can do that successfully around trans kids, then they can do it around kids with disabilities, or English learner kids, or other kids who really need federal protection.”
Why trans girls playing sports is key issue for Trump
Trump made the participation of trans athletes on girls’ and women’s sports teams a signature issue of his presidential campaign. He and his supporters have said that athletes who were assigned male at birth have an unfair physical advantage over their competitors whose birth sex was female.
When trans girls medal in sporting competitions, they say, it takes honors away from cisgender girls and could reduce their shot at a college scholarship. Some cisgender girls feel uncomfortable undressing in front of trans girls in the locker room.
“A sport I had loved and had put my heart into became a sport that was painful and a constant reminder of the physical abilities that I do not have,” the Maine 12th grader who tied for second place in the girls’ pole vault championship wrote in an opinion piece for the Portland Press Herald. “How were we expected to compete with someone who would always physically dominate?”
Advocates for trans athletes, meanwhile, say it’s crucial for kids to be able to play on teams that correspond with their gender identity so they feel included at school. Trans kids are at a much higher risk for depression and suicide, and playing sports can help with self-esteem and mental health.
“Leadership, teamwork, being a good loser and a good winner — all those great benefits that sports provide, which is why sports are an important part of your education — that needs to be available to all of our students, including our transgender students,” said Sarah McDaniel, who has a trans son and is the president of the Portland chapter of PFLAG, which supports the families and friends of LGBTQ people.
Trump’s executive order focused on student athletics wasn’t his only directive focused on gender. On the first day of his second term, he also signed an executive order stating that the federal government would recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that the definition of “sex” under federal law did not include gender identity.
That helped form the policy backbone for his early February directive about trans athletes.
In addition to its threat to strip federal funds from any educational program with policies deemed “unfair to female athletes”, the executive order expressed the Trump administration’s opposition to “male competitive participation in women’s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.”
That executive order also urged athletics organizations and states to change policies that allow trans girls to compete in women’s sports, even if they “reduce the testosterone in their bodies below certain levels or provide documentation of ‘sincerely held’ gender identity.”
Manning said the Trump administration’s swift approach to enforcing Title IX matches the issue’s urgency: “The threat to these women is happening right now. It is, right now, a violation of Title IX.”
It’s also a “political no-brainer,” Manning said, pointing to polling from January by the New York Times and Ipsos that found 79% of American adults do not think trans women should be allowed to compete on women’s sports teams. That finding mirrors other recent polls.
Trump administration takes unusual civil rights approach
The federal government’s treatment of Maine is unprecedented, multiple legal experts told Chalkbeat, from the way it carried out its investigations to the severity of the consequences it has imposed.
The Education Department has a backlog of civil rights cases and recently fired hundreds of civil rights attorneys. But it chose to open the Maine investigation unprompted by any complaints.
While any agency that gives federal funds to an educational institution can enforce Title IX, the Education Department typically leads the charge because it has the most expertise. But in this case, the Department of Health and Human Services, which usually investigates medical schools and hospital training programs, opened the first investigation, followed by the Education Department.
Both decided Maine had violated Title IX within a few weeks — though these kinds of investigations typically take many months to conclude.
Neither federal agency requested any data or documents or attempted to interview anyone from the Maine Department of Education before issuing their findings, said Danna Hayes, a spokesperson for the Maine attorney general’s office, which is representing the state’s education agency.
The Education Department’s draft agreement contained five pages of demands, including stripping any trans girl who’s ever placed in a Maine girls sports competition of her title and giving it to the athlete behind her with an apology letter. Maine should have received 90 days to consider that proposal, according to the agency’s manual. Maine got just 10.
There’s a clear process for investigating potential civil rights violations, said R. Shep Melnick, a professor of American politics at Boston College who’s studied Title IX and civil rights. The Trump administration has “done none of that.”
“I’ve been critical of OCR in the past under Biden and Obama for using investigations basically to get schools to do what they want without following these procedures, but this is far worse,” Melnick said.
The Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies targeted Maine, too.
Neither the Education Department nor the Agriculture Department responded to Chalkbeat’s questions regarding the Trump administration’s Title IX enforcement strategy and its probes in Maine.
In response to a list of questions, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, directed Chalkbeat to a two-sentence social media post from March 28 in which the department said it had referred its Maine Title IX investigation to the Justice Department. “HHS will continue to protect women’s sports and keep the promises of Title IX,” the post states.
Who gets to define ‘sex’?
Many biologists now think sex is more complicated than the male and female binary. But Title IX is “completely silent” on the issue of transgender athletes and does not spell out whether schools should require trans athletes to play on teams that correspond with their birth sex or their gender identity, Melnick said.
Congress could pass a law to define sex under Title IX. Or the Trump administration could go through the lengthy formal rule-making process. The Biden administration tried to define sex to include gender identity in a rule, but a federal judge threw it out. A separate Biden administration proposal that ultimately could have allowed high schools and colleges to restrict the participation of trans athletes never made it across the finish line.
The Trump administration has said Title IX “forbids” trans girls from playing on girls’ and women’s sports teams, and allowing them to do so is an outright violation of the law.
But multiple civil rights experts told Chalkbeat that’s not how Title IX is enforced under the 1979 policy interpretation that governs the Education Department’s civil rights investigations.
It’s a Title IX violation if girls lack equal access to athletics in the aggregate. For example, an investigator concerned about whether girls had the same access to athletic gear as boys would look at the equipment used by all teams, not just the tennis team.
“Identical benefits, opportunities, or treatment are not required, provided the overall effects of any differences is negligible,” the 1979 policy states.
On top of that, there are federal court rulings in two cases, one in the Ninth Circuit and another in the Fourth Circuit, that have upheld the rights of trans girls to play on teams that correspond with their gender identity.
Those cases are ongoing. But the Trump administration hasn’t said why the 14 states bound by those decisions should not follow them, Galanter said.
“It’s just completely unclear what their legal theory is here,” Galanter said.
Issue of trans athletes continues to divide Maine
On Friday, the Maine attorney general’s office told the Trump administration that the state wouldn’t agree to the Education Department’s Title IX resolution. Maine offered no counter-proposals.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” Maine’s assistant attorney general, Sarah Forster, wrote.
In response, the Education Department said it had referred the case to the Justice Department and would start the administrative process to take away Maine’s K-12 education funding. That includes discretionary grants and formula funds, the department said, which covers Title I dollars for high-poverty schools and IDEA grants for children with disabilities.
“Governor Mills would have done well to adhere to the wisdom embedded in the old idiom — be careful what you wish for,” Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said Friday in a statement. “Now she will see the Trump Administration in court.”
Hayes, of the Maine attorney general’s office, declined to comment further, and the Education Department did not respond to follow-up questions from Chalkbeat.
Galanter worried a Justice Department lawsuit against Maine could make even school districts and states with gender-affirming athletics policies “really scared to have trans kids play sports, or even worse, have kids who people think are trans play on sports teams.”
“There is no way to enforce gender that isn’t gross, weird, a complete invasion of privacy,” said Bre Danvers-Kidman, the executive co-director of MaineTransNet, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of transgender people in Maine. Kids think: “I don’t want to have to show somebody my junk to play softball.”
The issue continues to divide people in Maine.
Republican state lawmakers introduced several bills to restrict the participation of trans athletes on sports teams. Mills, Maine’s Democratic governor, said the issue is “worthy of a debate” but that for now, she will defend the state’s current laws.
Hundreds of people recently turned out to a rally to support trans youth outside Greely High School, where the winning pole vaulter is a student, including several of her classmates.
Maine School Administrative District 51, which includes Greely, did not sign a resolution agreement with HHS, but the school district responded to the Education Department’s probe.
The district had less than two weeks to reply to dozens of requests, said Melissa Hewey, the attorney representing the district, including for rosters of every girls sports team and any trans athletes playing on them, and a breakdown of how the district’s fields and equipment compare for boys and girls.
Maine has a long tradition of standing up for what it believes in, “even in the face of political pressures,” said Danvers-Kidman, who’s listened to how angry this situation has made trans kids in meetings across the state.
For their sake, Danvers-Kidman hopes Maine stands its ground.

Some of the first signs Teitelbaum had ALS appeared during a vacation to Mexico in 2022. She and her husband, Steven, had taken their grandsons on a trip to Cancun when they noticed Marilyn’s foot was dragging, an early sign of her impending nerve degeneration.
The average patient dies within a few years of diagnosis. What starts as muscle weakness advances to total incapacitation.
“Marilyn didn’t want to do that or have the family experience it, so the day that she was diagnosed, she said to the physician that she is not going to go to the end with this,” said Steven Teitelbaum, who has worked as a medical researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis for more than 50 years.
Rather than live out the fatal disease, which leads to permanent paralysis, Teitelbaum took another trip, this time to Colorado — one of 10 states, plus Washington, D.C., where physician-assisted dying is legal. Under the laws, physicians can prescribe life-ending medication to terminally ill patients who request it.
Before establishing residency in Colorado, the couple rented an ocean-front house in Hawaii for a week, and the family flew out to join. The grandsons took surfing lessons and played soccer. They took a helicopter tour. They had parties and events where Marilyn gave away her jewelry.
“She was very gracious,” Teitelbaum said. “There was no weeping or feeling sorry for herself or anything like that. It was: How much can I enjoy my family, and particularly my grandchildren and children?”
In Colorado, where she had family, the couple hosted celebrations. A nephew who plays the trumpet brought his band to play for her.
But by the time she took the lethal medication nine months after her diagnosis, Marilyn Teitelbaum’s disease had advanced rapidly. Quickly losing muscle function and no longer able to stand on her own, she chose to take the medication two weeks ahead of schedule.
“It’s a gracious way to go, actually. And when Marilyn did die, she could die with grace,” Teitelbaum said. On Jan. 26, 2023, she woke up and had breakfast. About a half dozen of her closest relatives gathered around her. A nephew played the guitar. “And it was just going to sleep,” her husband said.
Missouri is one of at least 25 states this year where lawmakers are considering legislation related to physician-assisted dying, a practice controversial enough that there’s debate over what to call it. Proponents prefer “medical aid in dying,” while opponents insist “physician-assisted suicide” is more forthright.
The American Medical Association takes a stance against physician-assisted suicide as “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer,” difficult or impossible to control, and posing serious societal risks, the group’s website said.
A 2024 Gallup poll found 66% of Americans believe doctors should “be allowed by law to assist the patient to commit suicide” when a terminally ill patient in severe pain requests it.
New Mexico, the most recent state to legalize physician-assisted suicide, did so in 2021. Delaware’s Democratic governor vetoed a bill to legalize assisted dying in 2024, and in 2023, Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo similarly vetoed a legalization bill.
Lawmakers in 18 states are considering legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide. As in a number of other states, Missouri’s “Marilyn Teitelbaum Death with Dignity Act” has languished without a committee hearing.
“We were unable to secure a Republican sponsor for it,” said Rep. Ian Mackey, D-St. Louis, who introduced the bill this year and last. “Until we can do that, it’s not going to get any traction.”
 Momentum to legalize in New York, Illinois and Delaware

Strong political will exists in Illinois, Delaware and New York to move legislation legalizing assisted dying forward, said Elizabeth Armijo, national director of legislative advocacy at Compassion & Choices.
New York lawmakers are taking up the issue again for the 10th consecutive session. Two identical bills are in health committees in their respective chambers.
A 2024 YouGov poll found 64% of New Yorkers support passing the legislation, and another 8% are leaning toward supporting it. The bill is gaining sponsors in the state’s House and Senate quickly, with those in favor of the bill vying for Gov. Kathy Hochul’s support.
Between the two bills, 90 lawmakers have signed on as sponsors “and that number is continuing to grow,” said Corinne Carey of Compassion & Choices. “I am more hopeful than ever that this will be the year the legislature finally passes the bill.”
In the Illinois General Assembly, two bills are progressing, but face opposition from pro-life advocates and medical professionals.
“This can be an emotional issue, and many fallacies circle medical aid in dying,” said Illinois state Sen. Linda Holmes, who co-sponsored one of the measures, said during a Senate executive committee hearing. “I encourage those with misgivings to read the legislation in full to see its criteria and the safeguards that would protect patients, medical professionals, and relatives.”
Last year in Delaware, outgoing Gov. John Carney vetoed a bill to legalize the practice after it had passed the state’s Senate by one vote. A similar measure this year passed the Delaware House and a Senate committee, and now awaits approval from the full Senate.
“So many of these efforts get incredibly close, and then they’re disappointing. They’re so disappointing for our terminally ill advocates who don’t have the luxury of having one more session,” Armijo said. “They don’t have the luxury of waiting for another legislative session and so often they really die waiting.”
Bills introduced in states where the practice is legal would amend aspects of the law including waiting time or who qualifies to prescribe the medication. Opponents say the efforts remove safeguards while proponents argue these improve access.
Two bills — one in New Jersey and another in Washington — would, for qualifying patients, waive the wait period between the patient’s first and second required request for the medication.
Bills in Oregon and Vermont would allow certified licensed nurse practitioners and physician assistants, in addition to physicians, to prescribe the medication. A measure in California would remove the Jan. 1, 2031, sunset on the state’s law.
In Montana, a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling permitted the practice; a bill to codify its legality died in March. A competing measure that would make it illegal for doctors to prescribe the medications passed the state Senate but was defeated on the House floor April 9.
“This bill reinforces that life is valuable and should be protected,” said the bill’s sponsor, Montana state Sen. Carl Glimm, during a March 19 hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.
 Opponents fear second-tier medicine for terminally ill

As a pathologist, death is a common part of Steven Teitelbaum’s life. With physician-assisted dying, he said it’s crucial that no one making the decision is encouraged by others to do it.
“If that’s not dealt with, then the other side has a very compelling argument,” he said.
Assisted-dying laws in the United States follow the basic criteria of the initial Oregon legalization bill. Geoff Sugerman, who helped write Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act, echoed Teitelbaum’s concern.
“It’s something that always has to be driven by the patient. The patient is the one who really has to initiate that conversation,” said Sugerman, who now works as the national policy advisor for Death with Dignity, an advocacy group.
Jessica Rodgers grew up in Oregon, the first state to legalize assisted dying in 1997, when the debate over the issue began making headlines. Oregon doctors who supported the law publicly advocated for it. Rogers was 12 when her mother was given six months to live after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Her mother met the qualifications for assisted dying.
With her father working two jobs, Rodgers took care of her mother. She remembers one of the doctors in her mother’s oncology practice was an outspoken advocate for the bill that would become Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act.
“As her primary caregiver, it changed how I viewed her doctor’s appointments, because I felt as though I needed to protect her from her doctor, and I never wanted her to be alone with her doctor,” Rodgers said.
Her mother lived for three and a half years, long enough to hold her first grandchild, Rodgers said.
Now a social worker who specializes in gerontology, Rodgers has spent the last two decades advocating against physician-assisted suicide. Today she works as the coalitions director at Patients Rights Action Fund.
She fears legalizing assisted death creates a lower standard of care for people who are terminally ill.
The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, an industry group, takes a neutral stance on assisted dying, but echoes similar concerns over the practice’s effect on “the perceived or actual integrity of the medical profession,” according to its website.
About 22% of Americans – 74 million people – live in jurisdictions where assisted dying is legal. Between 1998 and 2020, just 5,329 people died using physician-assisted death in the United States. That’s according to a 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society .
Each state collects data differently making it difficult to analyze trends, according to the study’s author, Elissa Kozlov, an assistant professor at Rutgers University.

The findings are the latest in a string of problems at hospitals owned by private-equity funded Prospect Medical Holdings.
Currently, Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Memorial Hospital and Rockville General Hospital all face an uncertain future following the apparent collapse of a purchase deal with Yale New Haven Health.
According to inspection reports obtained by Connecticut Public, nurses at the intensive care unit at Waterbury Hospital were “concerned that the ICU is often inappropriately staffed which causes unsafe conditions, there are frequently unsafe staff assignments.”
The report says nurses at the hospital feel overwhelmed and that “they are not providing quality patient care,” the 2024 records showed.
“The RNs indicated that the ICU is staffed unsafely on most days, and not consistent with the hospital Staffing Plan, and staff is exhausted which leads them to call out for scheduled shifts,” the report states.
Records show the nurse absenteeism rate in the ICU was 31%, and to fill the gap, administrative staff stepped in with patient care.
Edmond Gadomski, the hospital’s nurses’ union representative, said nurses are working short-staffed and taking on bigger assignments than they should.
“So yes, they are burned out, [it] does increase the absenteeism in the hospital,” Gadomski said. “They’re not superheroes, there’s only so much that they can do. You’re taking care of 5,6,7 patients when you should be at a 1 to 4 cap.”
In a statement, Waterbury Hospital said it has been in compliance “with at least 80% of the nursing staffing assignments outlined in the hospital’s staffing plan, which is within DPH’s requirements,” and it is actively recruiting nurses, and adding traveler nurses to its rosters to provide additional help.
But Gadomski said the shortage is ongoing, despite records filed by the hospital with the DPH to the contrary.
“I have some departments at 50% vacancy rate, 33-to-40% vacancy rates, there’s no way that they could be compliant,” he said. “And I have actually filed a violation or complaint myself in the DPH, so that they will investigate that fact.”
DPH declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation.
In addition, the hospital is looking into the use of an acuity tool through the electronic health records system to better align staffing with patient needs, the records showed.
A registered ICU nurse interviewed by the DPH approximately five hours into the shift said he was unable to titrate medications on patients for the shift due to the workload and acuity of the patients.
And a DPH inspection of the gastroenterology unit identified that the assistant director of gastroenterology and medical therapies was not a registered nurse, as required, and was not able to assist with care when the registered nurses needed help.
Prospect filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings Jan. 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas. Prospect does not own hospitals in Texas, but may have chosen that state as some debtors find Texas preferable in bankruptcy court, Chris Mattei, a former assistant U.S. attorney, told Connecticut Public.

,DC,2025-04-14 14:42:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. human rights law likely violated in $6M payment for El Salvador prison, experts say",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-human-rights-law-likely-violated-6m-payment-el-salvador-prison-experts-say,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department is paying El Salvador $6 million to house hundreds of immigrants deported from the United States in an immense and brutal prison there, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.But a U.S. law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations. That has led those who wrote what’s known as the Leahy Law and enforced it for years to question the legality of the $6 million payment made as President Donald Trump carries out his campaign of mass deportation.The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 men to CECOT, after invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to apply to Venezuelan nationals 14 and older who are suspected members of the gang Tren de Aragua.On March 30, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said another 17 nationals from El Salvador were sent to CECOT, again alleging gang ties. On Sunday, Rubio said 10 more men were sent to the prison in El Salvador, and noted how “the alliance between” the U.S. and El Salvador “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere.”Tim Rieser, the main author of the Leahy Law while a longtime foreign policy aide to former U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the $6 million payment for those migrants’ incarceration for up to a year is likely a violation of the law.“Sending migrants who have not been charged or convicted of any crime to the maximum-security terrorism prison in El Salvador, where they have no access to lawyers or their families, where they have no rights of due process, and with no idea if they will ever be released, held in cruel and shockingly degrading conditions, would certainly appear to violate the Leahy Law,” Rieser told States Newsroom.“I don't think the Trump administration is upholding the Leahy Law or other laws that protect human rights,” he said.Also deeply concerned is Charles Blaha, a former State Department official for 32 years who led the office responsible for vetting the Leahy Law worldwide, the Office of Security and Human Rights, from 2016 to 2023.“CECOT is a facility that exposes prisoners to torture, and cruel, degrading, and inhumane treatment and punishment,” Blaha said in an interview. “Under the Leahy Law, this should disqualify CECOT from receiving U.S. assistance.""Trump has also expressed that he is open to sending U.S. citizens to CECOT.“I love that,” he said. “I don’t know what the law says on that.”El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is scheduled to visit with Trump at the White House on Monday.Trump administration says law followedThe Trump administration plans to keep using the mega-prison as deportations continue under the Alien Enemies Act, top officials such as U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have pledged. Noem visited the prison in March.“This facility is one of the tools in our toolkits that we will use,” Noem said during her tour of CECOT.The State Department has denied any potential violations.

“The Department is following all applicable laws related to foreign assistance, including the State Leahy Law,” a State Department spokesperson wrote in a statement to States Newsroom.The spokesperson said the U.S. is engaged with El Salvador through foreign assistance to address unauthorized migration and human trafficking.“As these countries continue to work with us in securing our borders and addressing illegal immigration, we will provide assistance as necessary in support of these collaborative efforts,” the spokesperson said. “Our goal is to ensure that our partners are well-equipped to handle the challenges they face, ultimately contributing to a more stable and secure region.”The 1997 Leahy Law refers to two statutes – one applying to the State Department and one covering the Department of Defense – that prevent U.S. funds from being used for assistance to foreign security forces that have credible allegations of gross violations of human rights such as torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance or rape. Payment originThe exact agency within the State Department that is paying out the $6 million in funding to CECOT is unclear and is a source of interest among Democrats in Congress.It is likely coming out of the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, said Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight at the Washington Office of Latin America, a research and advocacy group that aims to advance human rights in North and South America.INL, among other things, gives financial assistance to security forces and is subject to the Leahy Law, Isacson said.

The State Department did not answer detailed questions from States Newsroom as to whether the funds were coming from INL. “And even if Leahy doesn't apply, the State Department has a duty to make sure that we're not turning over people, even if they're not our citizens, to places where they'll be mistreated or tortured,” Blaha said.The State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor oversees an office that vets recipients of proposed foreign aid for potential gross human rights violations.Fewer than 1% of requests are blocked after going through vetting through the Leahy Law compliance database. Those units that are blocked from funding are publicly posted on a case-by-case basis.The most recent listing of publicly rejected units is from 2022, so there is no publicly available record of CECOT or the security units in charge of El Salvador's prisons being vetted because the prison was built in 2023. However, experts say the country’s record of prison management and publicly available details about the mega-prison mean it should be on the latest version of the list.  Beatings, use of electric shocksThe State Department’s 2023 Human Rights Report on El Salvador noted there were credible reports from human rights organizations “of abuse and mistreatment of detainees by prison guards.”Groups cited in the report interviewed people who were released from prisons in El Salvador and “reported systemic abuse in the prison system, including beatings by guards and the use of electric shocks.”

“The coalition alleged the treatment of prisoners constituted torture,"" according to the report.The State Department in its report raised concerns about abusive physical conditions in El Salvador’s prisons, such as overcrowding.While CECOT is not mentioned in the report by name, the report noted that El Salvador's government opened a new facility in January 2023 to hold up to 40,000 detainees, which apparently is now CECOT.No access to CECOTNo human rights group has had access to investigate the conditions of the CECOT prison, said Juanita Goebertus Estrada, the director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.Goebertus Estrada has studied El Salvador’s prison system since the country’s Congress allowed President Bukele to issue a state of emergency in 2022 that suspended due process. It’s led to 1.4% of the population, about 84,000 people, being incarcerated.“We have no reason to believe that the (CECOT) conditions are not similar to those in the rest of the El Salvadorian prison system,” she said. “It's administered by the same institution and the training of the guards is the same.”She added that Human Rights Watch and other organizations have not documented anyone who is imprisoned at CECOT ever leaving. Additionally, attorneys and families are not allowed to visit.“The government has explicitly said that this is a prison for the most reprehensible members of gangs, and that they're going to rot there,” Goebertus Estrada said.More than 300 people have died in prisons across El Salvador in the last three years, Goebertus Estrada said. That kind of record, WOLA’s Isacson said, is something that should trigger the Leahy Law.“The Salvadoran units in charge of the prison system... you think would come up because of extraordinarily credible allegations of about 300 people dying in the prison system in the last three years,” Isacson said.Enforcement up to CongressIsacson said if the State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor is not enforcing the Leahy Law, then “it would be up to members of Congress to raise this” concern and potentially pull funding for the bureau in a future appropriations bill.The most recent warnings about violations of the Leahy Law have been tied to the start of the 2023 war in Gaza and the role of U.S. security assistance to Israel units. Thousands of Palestinians have died in the Israel-Hamas war.“You had Israeli units, who would not have qualified, getting aid, and Democrats not really making any noise about it,” Isacson said. “The (Leahy) Law is mortally wounded.”Democratic senators pressed DHS on April 8 to provide a copy of the contract between the U.S. and El Salvador. And House Democratic members, such as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, are pushing for a congressional delegation to visit CECOT.Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, visited the prison in July 2024, calling CECOT “the solution” and adding “the good ideas in El Salvador actually have legs and can go to other places and help other people be safe and secure and hopeful and prosperous.”  U.S. citizens at CECOT?El Salvador’s Bukele has become a key ally in Trump's plans for mass deportations.One of Rubio’s first visits to Latin America as secretary of State was to El Salvador. During that February trip, Rubio and Bukele talked about the possibility of detaining immigrants removed from the U.S. in El Salvador. Bukele also offered to imprison U.S. citizens.

“And in an extraordinary gesture never before extended by any country, President Bukele offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals, including U.S. citizens and legal residents,” according to the State Department’s readout of the trip.Noem said during an April 9 border security conference that the Trump administration will continue to carry out deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and maintain a strong partnership with El Salvador.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled April 7 that, for now, the Trump administration can continue use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those subject to the proclamation must have due process, including court hearings.The high court did not rule on the merits of using the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, when the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. Until now, the Alien Enemies Act has only been used during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.The Venezuelan men who were sent to CECOT on March 15 under the wartime act, were not notified and or given due process, federal trial and appellate judges have noted. Lawyers for many of the Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador said their clients were not involved in gangs and instead either had no criminal record or were in the middle of asylum hearings before an immigration judge.‘Cruelty is the point’During the April 9 conference, Noem touted her meeting with Bukele and said the kind of partnership exemplified by the use of the prison would continue.However, the Trump administration has taken the position that those at the CECOT prison are no longer in U.S. custody. In a high-profile case, the Supreme Court April 10 ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of a wrongly deported Maryland man to the prison back to the U.S., but stopped short of requiring it.

“The idea of paying someone else to be your (Guantanamo Bay), is brand new,” Isacson said, referring to the U.S. Navy base in Cuba that houses foreign nationals accused of terrorism.Noem visited CECOT after the Trump administration invoked the wartime law to send deportation flights to El Salvador. On camera Noem pointed behind her and warned the same would happen to immigrants who ""commit crimes against the American people.”Behind her were dozens of men who were stripped from the waist up, their tattoos visible behind bars.Blaha was highly critical of Noem’s visit, where she took videos and pictures of the incarcerated men.“Noem's stunt epitomizes cruel, degrading, and inhumane treatment, which is why the administration loves it so much,” he said. “Sadly, the cruelty is the point with these guys.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-14 11:16:51.901155

(Photo illustration by zimmytws/Getty Images Plus)The first words of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution tell us that “all persons born or naturalized” in the United States are U.S. citizens.
This is the law of “birthright citizenship.”
The amendment was ratified in 1868, and its initial purpose was clear. The Civil War had nominally ended 300 years of slavery, but the newly freed African Americans had neither citizenship nor civil or constitutional rights.
The 14th Amendment was supposed to fix that. You’re born here; you’re a citizen. End of story.
Except the story has never ended.
In today’s atmosphere of virulent political animosity and cultural conflict, it is useful to understand that “birthright citizenship” is not so much about birth anymore as it is about citizenship and the rights that accompany it.
This is what made the 14th Amendment a lightning rod in the civil rights movement.
My new book set for release Tuesday, “Grant’s Enforcer,” follows the career of Reconstruction-era Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, the first federal lawman to understand the potential reach of the amendment in protecting the underserved.
His immediate concerns were the predations of the Ku Klux Klan in the interior counties of South Carolina — especially York County, on the northern border.
But he also believed the amendment could be used to blunt Americans’ ugly and recurring tendency to demonize the “other” in our society.
In 1868, the “other” were the freed slaves, but many groups have subsequently played this unenviable role: Chinese contract laborers; interned Japanese Americans; pregnant mothers crossing the border to give birth; Jews and Black Americans on countless occasions.
Over the last decade this spotlight has focused on refugees and immigrants, Muslims generally and, most recently, anyone whose sexual orientation differs from the “norm.”
Akerman, a Republican from Georgia, knew that “citizenship” was a hollow privilege without guaranteed rights. He made his case before a congressional committee late in 1868 when many states in the former Confederacy were being savaged by Ku Klux Klan terrorism.
Local law enforcement mostly ignored these offenses, seldom tried them and never convicted anyone. Congress wanted to know what to do about it.
Akerman had a simple answer: Prosecute the cases as federal crimes and try them in federal court.
Under the 14th Amendment, no one could deny a citizen’s voting rights, break into someone’s house or take someone’s guns. And if you murdered the father, beat the mother or raped the daughter during your home invasion, these crimes could be added to the case against you.
Under the 14th Amendment, these offenses were now violations of the civil and constitutional rights of U.S. citizens.
When President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him attorney general in mid-1870, Akerman set out to test his theory. In October elections, Republicans in South Carolina won both the governorship and both houses of the Legislature, benefitting from a solid voting majority of newly enfranchised Black voters.
Democrats were enraged, and by the end of 1870 the Ku Klux Klan had ravaged parts of South Carolina to such a degree that its exploits had become national news.
Akerman chose York County as his testing ground because the U.S. Army garrison in Yorkville (today’s York) had collected massive amounts of intelligence and knew everyone in the county who was affiliated with the Klan — leaders, soldiers and sympathizers.
By year’s end, federal authorities had 200 York County Klansmen in custody, and 500 others had surrendered. Thousands more South Carolina Klansmen fled the state altogether, and Klansmen across the South ducked their heads.
The final act played out in federal court in Columbia at the end of 1871. Akerman sought convictions for violations of civil and constitutional rights: voter intimidation, confiscation of firearms and home invasion.
He failed, but he was not surprised. Akerman was proposing new law, while the defense relied on the canon of states’ rights. In the end, the court declined to hear a 14th Amendment case.
As a fallback, Akerman’s prosecutors charged the defendants narrowly with conspiracy to deny the voting rights of their victims, invariably threatened with beatings — or worse — unless they abandoned the Republican Party.
Akerman’s team won these cases effortlessly: 55 York County Klansmen were either convicted or pleaded guilty.
It was, however, a hollow victory.
The Klan, as such, disappeared for 50 years, but white terrorism never abated. In 1876, former Confederate cavalry Gen. Wade Hampton, supported by paramilitary “Red Shirts,” won a bloody gubernatorial race to restore white supremacy to South Carolina. In 1895, a new state constitution effectively disenfranchised Black voters.
Full vindication for Amos T. Akerman only came a century later.
Beginning with the “Mississippi Burning” case in 1966, where seven Ku Klux Klan defendants were convicted in the murders of three civil rights workers, prosecutors have repeatedly called on the same laws that Akerman used in Columbia.
The 14th Amendment today underpins rights cases ranging from hate crimes to human trafficking, disenfranchisement, and election fraud — exactly how Akerman would have wanted.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/birthright-citizenship-1024x853.jpg,,,2025-04-14 11:16:51.901155

(Photo by Blair Miller / Daily Montanan)Debate over legislation prohibiting towns from enacting red flag gun laws, House Bill 809, led to accusations of sexism in the Senate chamber over the weekend.
The hot button issue drew strong testimony from numerous senators, including Sen. Ellie Boldman, a Missoula Democrat.
The bill, brought by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls and carried in the Senate by Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, states, “extreme risk protection orders violate a person’s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.”
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, “Research has shown that states can save lives by authorizing courts to issue extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs) that temporarily prevent a person in crisis from accessing firearms.”
Arguing against the bill, Boldman spoke about a man who killed a woman with a gun, explaining numerous red flags that should have prevented him from having a weapon.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, then accused Boldman of being melodramatic.
“I enjoyed the histrionics of the opponent to this bill,” Fuller said.
Boldman later called his criticism “blatant sexism” in a social media post.
Fuller’s statement elicited an immediate, though quiet, reaction in Senate chambers with several members looking on in shock.
Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, asked Fuller to clarify what he had said after the Kalispell legislator finished explaining why he thought local governments shouldn’t be allowed to enact gun laws.
“Histrionic is defined as undue emotion in presentation of what they believe to be true,” Fuller said. “I believe that’s the definition.”
The Senate approvedHouse Bill 809 in a 29-21 vote shortly after.
However, at the end of the meeting, when senators may make comments unrelated to agenda items, several referenced the debate over HB 809.
Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, expressed frustration with how women in Senate chambers are treated.
“We live in a society where words have additional connotations beyond their dictionary definitions,” Morigeau said. “So I must say that the use of histrionics has always been derogatory towards women.”
Morigeau said she’s witnessed disrespect toward women time and time again during the Legislature. She said the body frequently consults its decorum rules for other matters, but not when it comes to the way women are treated.
“I have seen in my 73 days in here, over and over, many times, the women in this body being put down, overtly, subtly,” Morigeau said. “And I just, I am tired of it.”
Fuller also spoke, again defining histrionics, and said, “if someone takes offense to that, I’m sorry, I apologize, but there is nothing wrong with them being dramatic, lively and excitable in this chamber.”
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings commented how men’s speech can be perceived as “passionate” while when women speak, it’s sometimes referred to as “emotional.” He apologized for his caucus and said the chamber needs to do better.
“We all have the right to have our arguments,” Zolnikov said, adding they also had the right to argue, “how we want to.”
Manzella spoke in defense of her male colleagues.
“I would like to specifically thank the men in this chamber, and specifically on my side of the aisle,” Manzella said. “Thank you, guys.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8213-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 11:16:51.901155

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)While a student studying economics, my professors often said that our national debt was nothing to worry about. This was the late 1990’s; the national debt was $5 trillion. They argued that deficit spending was an investment in our economy and in government programs that benefit people. The U.S. was politically powerful and wealthy so we could manage our debt and interest payments, no problem.
In 1946 our debt was 121% of the country’s total economic output, mostly due to WWII, but fell to 32% by 1974. This drop was not a consequence of paying off the country’s debt. It occurred because our economy grew much faster than our accumulating debt.
Today, there is more public concern about the country’s debt level, likely because it is a political talking point. But also because gross debt has grown to $36 trillion. Tax cuts are one of the primary drivers of our growing debt, even though most of the debate is focused on government spending. 
The tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy enacted during the first Trump administration increased our national debt by $2.5 trillion. In fact, tax cuts enacted since 2001 are responsible for 57% of the increase in the debt ratio (debt as a percent of economic output). If these tax cuts were never enacted, the debt ratio would be declining, rather than increasing.
Managing the country’s debt is more difficult when the economy slows. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently released its long-term budget outlook report. The CBO projects that the economy will grow more slowly as the labor force shrinks. And the recently enacted tariffs are forecasted to slow the economy even more, potentially causing a recession. 
Now is not the time to have a weak economy. Unlike corporations, the U.S. cannot declare bankruptcy or ask banks to forgive our debt. And selling residency gold cards for $5 million, as President Trump proposed, will not raise sufficient revenue.
The smartest way to manage our debt is to support policies that encourage a growing economy with a strong middle class, political stability and confidence in the U.S. dollar. 
To achieve this, Congress needs to work toward a fair tax system. It is short-sighted of Republicans to support large tax cuts for billionaires and profitable corporations. President Trump has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, well below the average tax rate of 24% for other developed countries. 
Many corporations are only paying effective tax rates of 9%. Minnesota companies Target, General Mills and UnitedHealth Group each had an average effective tax rate of 20% over the past five years, even though their total profits were $60 billion in 2024. In 1993, the top corporate tax rate was 38%, but was as high as 53% in 1942. 
Profitable corporations need to pay their fair share: They benefit from good roads, a trained workforce, antitrust oversight and national security. And billionaires do not need a tax cut. Furthermore, it has been shown that cutting taxes does not trickle down or spur economic growth — this did not happen in Kansas or with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
Extending tax cuts to corporations and billionaires is a priority for Republicans this year. But these tax cuts fail to solve any problem; tax cuts do not lower costs for Minnesotans. They do not lower the price of eggs, increase the supply of housing, or lower the cost of health care and child care. Instead, Minnesotans will be paying for these tax cuts by cuts to public schools, Social Security, Medicaid, Head Start, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Meals on Wheels and cancer research. Minnesotans will sacrifice safe food and drugs, services for veterans, good roads, safe bridges, rural broadband and clean energy. 
Tax cuts are so important to Republicans that they are not only threatening to cut programs like Medicaid, Social Security, and services for veterans, but are attempting to use a budget gimmick that assumes the tax cuts are budget neutral. They are not. To pay for the tax cuts, Republicans will be adding trillions to the country’s debt and will need to raise the debt ceiling to $41 trillion. 
Minnesota corporations should consider whether tax cuts are worth cutting vital programs for Minnesotans and increasing the debt. Corporate CEOs should realize that it is working Minnesotans who purchase their goods and keep our economy chugging along. Unfortunately, Minnesota families are struggling already and are in no position to pay for large tax cuts for billionaires and corporations.
Tariffs will further harm Minnesotans. Tariffs are a tax on goods that will add 2.5% to consumer prices, cost Minnesotans $5,200 per year, increase unemployment and hurt farmers. The tariffs will only raise $600 billion in revenue, not sufficient to cover the $5 trillion needed for the proposed Republican tax cuts to corporations and billionaires.
The Minnesota CEOs lobbying for tax cuts should rethink their strategy and instead spend their resources convincing Republicans of sound economic policies. Countries are retaliating against U.S. tariffs; China issued a 125% retaliatory tariff tax on U.S. imports and barred an additional 11 companies from doing business in China. Countries are also removing Minnesota products off their shelves and labeling American-made products so their customers may boycott them. These blanket tariffs — including on our longstanding friends and allies — are not sound economic policies; they harm Minnesota businesses, farmers and consumers.
Minnesotans will be harmed by other federal policies that have already been enacted or are in the works to set the table for the tax cut. Minnesota is expecting to lose significant federal funding as the Trump administration cancels grants and closes federal agencies. 
Federal funds comprise 35% of Minnesota state revenue, or $23 billion annually. Minnesota could easily lose billions. The federal government rescinded $226 million in federal grants from the Minnesota Department of Health. The University of Minnesota and Mayo could lose $117 million in NIH funding. Minnesota could lose billions in Medicaid funding and expects federal funding cuts for education and human services. All of these cuts will be detrimental to Minnesotans, particularly the most vulnerable.
Other threats could be more consequential than tariffs. Foreign governments may respond to tariffs or other threats by divesting of U.S. Treasury bonds or not holding U.S. dollars in reserve funds. (Currently the dollar is used in approximately 90% of global foreign exchange transactions and nearly 60% of global foreign exchange reserves.) The chaos and uncertainty from Republican leaders will have severe consequences that may damage confidence in the U.S. dollar and decrease our ability to manage the country’s debt.
If President Trump threatens to force foreign governments to swap U.S. Treasuries for cheaper bonds to reduce interest payments; continues to say that there is fraud in the U.S. Treasury debt payments; or interfere with the independent Federal Reserve Bank (like Trump did with the independent Federal Trade Commission), it could undermine U.S. credit worthiness, upset the global financial system, make U.S. Treasury bonds —the world’s safest asset — risky, increase interest rates, cause stagflation, devalue the dollar, and lead to a deep recession. 
And then the executive branch could leverage catastrophic economic instability to centralize more power.
The bottom line is that we need a strong and growing economy to manage our debt. To achieve this we need sound economic policies, a fair tax system, financially strong working families and accountable elected officials. 
I hope Minnesota Republicans start prioritizing the people they represent, and Minnesota executives lobby for economic policies that benefit their customers and their country, and push back against tariffs. 
We need to work together to face our challenges and to continue the journey of realizing the idea of America for all.  For our country to succeed, working people need to succeed. This is one lesson we should have learned by now.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1407604986-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-14 11:16:51.901155

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.










We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. 


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

Ervin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.
Yet the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.
The California DMV routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. 
Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again. 
CalMatters investigative reporter Robert Lewis reviewed vehicular manslaughter cases in California from 2019 through early 2024 to understand how California handles dangerous drivers.
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. 
Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.

Morgan Gire, Placer County District Attorney: “I don’t think anyone fully understands what you need to do behind the wheel to lose your driving privilege.”

Our key findings:

Nearly 40 percent of drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license.
The DMV issued licenses to 150 drivers less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road. 
Nearly 400 of the drivers charged with killing someone got a ticket or were in another collision — or both — after their fatal crash. 
The DMV has no record of vehicular manslaughter or related convictions of hundreds of drivers.

CA utilities not required to update fire maps

With Cal Fire’s rollout of updated local fire hazard maps concluded, California property owners who fall into the 2 million acres of “high” or “very high” fire danger areas are subject to a host of building codes and other rules to mitigate the spread of wildfires.
But a proposal for California’s three major utility companies to update their own fire risk maps — which would help impose more regulatory scrutiny and stricter rules for utility infrastructure in high-risk areas — was recently rejected by state regulators.
As CalMatters’ Malena Carollo explains, since their original filing in 2017, the fire maps have been voluntarily updated by the utilities in piecemeal updates. In 2023 the California Public Advocates Office, a state entity responsible for representing consumer interests and ratepayers, requested regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission to require the utilities to update their maps immediately and in their entirety. 
The companies — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — supported the request, which the commission rejected in January. A spokesperson for the commission said its members “cannot comment today on a potential future vehicle about the fire maps.”
The rejection came weeks after deadly wildfires swept through Los Angeles County. In March the county filed a suit against Edison, arguing that there was evidence the company was responsible for the Eaton Fire that killed 18 people.

Is CA’s law on paying college teachers outdated?


Students walk through the MiraCosta College campus in Oceanside on Sept. 26, 2024. Photo by Adriana Heldiz, CalMatters




From CalMatters higher education and workforce reporter Adam Echelman:
In 1961, California passed the “50 Percent Law,” which mandates much of how community colleges spend their money. Most of the state’s community colleges didn’t exist yet and there had never been a James Bond film.
College administrators say the rule is outdated.
In an April 8 report, the state auditor’s office said it agrees. The law requires community colleges to spend 50% of their funds on teacher salaries, with some exceptions. College leaders say the restrictions hamper their ability to spend money on counselors, librarians and other support services that students need.
The audit also said that the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office has done a poor job of enforcing schools’ compliance with the law. 
Teachers say the law is a bulwark against administrative bloat, keeping colleges focused on their educational mission. Over the course of one 10-year span, the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office reported that its schools have increased the number of administrators by 45 percent compared to just 3 percent for faculty, although the audit noted that the staffing data contains “anomalies” and “discrepancies.” 
The audit recommended amending the law but not eliminating it.



Former lawmaker to pay fine for campaign finance violation

Former Assemblymember Evan Low and his campaign will pay a $106,000 fine for using a technology-focused nonprofit to pay Alec Baldwin to appear at the politician’s re-election fundraiser and concealing the payment afterward, the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission decided Thursday. 
The hefty penalty comes five years after the agency began investigating Low and his relationship with the nonprofit he founded — a probe sparked by CalMatters’ reporting on the ties between Low and the foundation.

Angela Bereton, FPPC assistant enforcement chief, during a commission meeting Thursday: “This conduct was egregious. There was purposeful action taken to conceal this activity and it wasn’t reported for five years.”

After narrowly losing the 2024 U.S. Senate race to Democrat Elissa Slotkin, Rogers, 61, released a statement on his campaign website that he was ready to “be an ally for President Trump and champion for Michigan.”
“President Trump needs strong allies in the Senate to help him deliver on the mandate given by the American people,” said Rogers on the social media platform X. “That means bringing manufacturing jobs back to Michigan, protecting seniors’ social security, lowering the costs of gas, groceries & prescription drugs, and setting our kids up for success by improving the quality of their education.

Rogers is the first announced Republican to seek the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), who said in January he would not seek another term in 2026.
Other potential GOP candidates include U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland), state Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), and former gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon.
On the Democratic side, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) announced earlier this month she was running for Peters’ seat, while U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Abdul El-Sayed, a former gubernatorial candidate who recently stepped down as Wayne County’s health director, are also anticipated to announce candidacies.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) have also been mentioned as possible Democratic candidates.
Rogers, who represented his mid-Michigan district in Congress from 2001 to 2015, rose to become chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee. Prior to that he served as a state senator and FBI agent.
After leaving Congress, Rogers moved to Florida and went into the private sector as a cyber security adviser and businessman. His return in 2023 to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow brought with it questions whether or not his official residence was in the White Lake Township home he and wife Kristi had purchased earlier that year.
That house was eventually torn down and a new one built in its place. A check by Michigan Advance on Sunday indicated the home was completed and appeared to be occupied.
A request for confirmation of his residency was made to the Rogers campaign, but has yet to be returned.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) also released a statement Monday, saying Rogers was the conservative leader Michigan needs in the U.S. Senate.
“As an Army veteran and former special agent, Mike understands the importance of putting service before self. We need him in the U.S. Senate to help achieve President Trump’s America First agenda and to bring manufacturing and good-paying jobs back to Michigan,” said Thune.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PA169156-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137

Ivan Dimov was convicted of reckless driving in 2013, after fleeing police in Washington state while his passenger allegedly dumped heroin out the window. Before that, he got six DUIs in California over a six-year period. None of that would keep him off the road.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles reissued him a driver’s license in 2017. The next year, on Christmas Eve, he drove drunk again, running stop signs and a traffic light in midtown Sacramento, going more than 80 mph, court records show. He T-boned another car, killing a 28-year-old man who was going home to feed the cat before heading to his mom’s for the holiday.
Kostas Linardos had 17 tickets — including for speeding, reckless driving and street racing — and had been in four collisions. Then, in November 2022, he gunned his Ram 2500 truck as he entered a Placer County highway and slammed into the back of a disabled sedan, killing a toddler, court records show. He’s now facing felony manslaughter charges. 
In December of last year, while that case was open, the DMV renewed his driver’s license.

With state lawmakers grappling with how to address the death toll on our roads, CalMatters wanted to understand how California handles dangerous drivers.

Because California has no centralized court system and records aren’t online, we then traveled to courthouses up and down the state to read through tens of thousands of pages of files. Once we had defendants’ names and other information, we were able to get DMV driver reports for more than 2,600 of the defendants, providing details on their recent collisions, citations and license status. 
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.
We found nearly 40% of the drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license.
That includes a driver with two separate convictions for vehicular manslaughter, for crashes that killed a 16-year-old girl in 2009 and a 25-year-old woman in 2020. In July of last year, the DMV issued him a driver’s license.
The agency gave licenses to nearly 150 people less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road, we found. And while the agency has since suspended some of those, often after a conviction, the majority remain valid. In Santa Clara County, a man prosecutors charged with manslaughter got his current license just a month and a half after the collision that killed a mother of three young children.
And many drivers accused of causing roadway deaths don’t appear to have stopped driving recklessly. Records show that nearly 400 got a ticket or were in another crash — or both — after their deadly collisions.
A commercial driver drove his semi truck on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County in 2021. Less than a year later, he still had a valid license when he barreled his semi into slow-moving traffic, hitting four vehicles and killing a woman in Fresno County, records show. Another man, sentenced to nine years in prison for killing two women while driving drunk, got his privileges restored by the DMV after being paroled, only to drive high on meth in Riverside and weave head-on into another car, killing a woman.
“It is somewhat shocking to see how much you can get away with and still be a licensed driver in the state of California,” Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said. “I don’t think anyone fully understands what you need to do behind the wheel to lose your driving privilege.”
Almost as interesting as the information in the drivers’ DMV records is what’s not there.
Hundreds of drivers’ DMV records simply don’t list convictions for manslaughter or another crime related to a fatal crash, we found. The apparent error means some drivers who should have their driving privileges suspended instead show up in DMV records as having a valid license.

Key takeaways: How the DMV allows dangerous drivers to stay on the road
How we did it: Reporting on California’s deadly drivers


The cases we reviewed cut across demographics and geography. Defendants include farmworkers and a farm owner. They include off-duty police officers and people with lengthy rap sheets, drivers who killed in a fit of rage and others whose recklessness took the lives of those they loved most — high school sweethearts, siblings, children. The tragedies span this vast state. From twisty two-lane mountain roads near the Oregon border to the dusty scrubland touching Mexico. From the crowded streets of San Francisco to the highways of the Inland Empire. From Gold Country, to timber country, to Silicon Valley, to the almond capital of the world. So much death. More people than are killed by guns.
Dangerous drivers are able to stay on the roads for many reasons. The state system that targets motorists who rack up tickets is designed to catch clusters of reckless behavior, not long-term patterns. And while there are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for certain crimes, like DUIs, there is no such requirement for many vehicular manslaughter convictions. 
It’s often up to the DMV whether to act. Routinely it doesn’t. 
The DMV declined to make its director, Steve Gordon — who has been in charge since Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him in 2019 — available for an interview to discuss our findings. 
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, said the agency follows the law when issuing licenses. “We use our authority as mandated and as necessary,” he said. 
Even when the DMV does take away motorists’ driving privileges, state officials, law enforcement and the courts are often unable or unwilling to keep them off the road. We found cases where drivers racked up numerous tickets while driving on a suspended license and faced little more than fines before eventually causing a fatal crash, even though authorities could have sent them to jail.
Taking away someone’s driving privilege is no small decision. It can consign a family to poverty, affecting job prospects, child care and medical decisions. 
Still, the stakes couldn’t be higher. More than 20,000 people died on the roads of California from 2019 to early 2024.
Kowana Strong thinks part of the problem is that lawmakers and regulators are too quick to treat fatal crashes as an unfortunate fact of life, as opposed to something they can address. 
Her son Melvin Strong III — who went by his middle name, Kwaun — was finishing college and planning to start a master’s program in kinesiology when he was killed by Dimov, the driver with six prior DUI convictions. Kwaun was a bright and innocent young man, she said, just starting his life. 
“It’s just another accident as far as they’re concerned,” Kowana Strong said.
Holes in the DMV’s point system
Young people think they’re invincible. It’s the old who know how unfair life is, Jerrod Tejeda said.
His daughter Cassi Tejeda was just 22. She was months from graduating from Chico State with a bachelor’s degree in history and a plan to be a teacher. Outgoing and athletic, she wanted to travel, see the world and make her own life.
She had a girlfriend who was visiting. Courtney Kendall was 24 and a student at Louisiana State University.
On a Sunday afternoon in January 2022, a Volvo SUV topping speeds of 75 mph ran a red light and smashed into their Jeep, court records show. The collision killed them both.
“The most difficult part besides the incident is every day that goes by you’re always wondering what if. What would they be doing today?” Jerrod Tejeda said. “Would they be married? Would they have developed into the career that they chose? Where would she be living?”

Tanya Kendall lamented not being there to protect her daughter, hold her hand or say goodbye.
“Instead, I was left with the unbearable task of choosing what outfit she would be buried in. Buried, Your Honor. Not the gown she would wear to her graduation from LSU — the one she will never attend,” the mother wrote in a letter to a Butte County judge, adding that she and her husband stood in their daughter’s place, accepting her diploma. 
Such pain was preventable.
The driver of the Volvo, Matthew Moen, had a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit, according to court filings. And it wasn’t his first time drinking and driving. Moen was caught driving drunk in Oregon in 2016. He never completed the requirements of a diversion program and had an outstanding warrant at the time of the fatal crash, the Butte County district attorney’s office said. In January 2020, he was convicted of DUI in Nevada County for driving with a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit, given a couple weeks in jail and put on probation for three years.

His license was valid at the time of the fatal 2022 crash, records show.
Across the country, states grapple with how to effectively spot and punish drivers who could be a danger on the road. Often they rely on a basic point system, with drivers accruing points for various types of traffic violations and thresholds for when the state will take away a motorist’s driving privileges. But like many, California has such high limits that drivers with a pattern of reckless behavior can avoid punishment.
The state suspends a driver’s license for accumulating four points in a year, six points in two years or eight points in three years. What does it take to get that many points? Using a cellphone while driving is zero points. A speeding ticket is a point. Vehicular manslaughter is two points.
Between March 2017 and March 2022, Trevor Cook received two citations for running red lights, got two speeding tickets and was deemed responsible for two collisions, including one in which someone was injured, court records show. (A third red-light ticket was dismissed.) At-fault collisions add a point to a driver’s license, according to the DMV. But the incidents were spaced out enough that none resulted in a suspension.
So Cook had a valid license on April 14, 2022, just a month after his last speeding ticket, when he blew through a Yolo County stop sign at more than 100 mph.
At that exact moment, Prajal Bista passed through the intersection, on his way to work after dinner and a movie with his wife, according to details of the crash that prosecutors included in court filings. Bista was driving the speed limit and on track to make it to work 30 minutes early.
The force of the collision nearly split Bista’s Honda Civic in half. Investigators determined Bista had been wearing his seat belt, but the crash tore it apart. They found his body 75 feet from the intersection.
On March 28, 2024, Cook pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter.
Just a month later, on April 30, the DMV issued Cook his current driver’s license, agency records show. Less than two weeks after that, he got a ticket for disobeying a traffic signal.
Melinda Aiello, chief deputy district attorney in Yolo County, said her office didn’t know anything about the new license or the red-light ticket until contacted by CalMatters. What’s more, the manslaughter conviction — like hundreds of others we found — isn’t listed on Cook’s driving record.
Cook’s license was still listed as valid in California DMV records as of early 2025. But for now, he’s off the roadways: Last summer, Cook started serving time in state prison.
“It’s stunning to me that eight months later his license is still showing as valid and the conviction for killing someone while driving is not reflected in his driving record,” Aiello said. “You killed somebody. I’d think there might be some license implications.”
Orrock, the DMV spokesperson, said he couldn’t speak directly to why so many convictions are missing. But, he said, “we acknowledge that the process and coordination between the judicial system and the DMV must continually evolve to address any gaps that have been identified. And we’re looking into that.”
Kill someone, get your license back
There are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for various convictions. A first DUI conviction, for example, is a 6-to-10-month suspension. Felony vehicular manslaughter is a three-year loss of driving privileges. The agency isn’t necessarily required to give a license back if its driver safety branch deems a motorist too dangerous to drive, agency officials said.
But CalMatters found the agency regularly gives drivers their licenses back as soon as the legally required period ends. And once crashes, tickets and suspensions fall off a driver’s record after a few years, it’s often as if the motorist’s record is wiped clean. So even if the driver gets in trouble again, the agency often treats any future crashes and traffic violations as isolated incidents, not as part of a longer pattern of reckless driving.
Perhaps that’s why Joshua Daugherty is licensed to drive in California.
In July 2020, Daugherty drifted onto the highway shoulder while driving near Mammoth Lakes, overcorrected to the left and lost control, court filings show. His Toyota Tacoma cut across the lane into oncoming traffic, where an SUV broadsided it. Daugherty’s girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kazmark, died. Police noted that Daugherty’s eyes were red and watery and his speech was slurred when they arrived. He told officers that he’d smoked “a couple of bowls” of marijuana earlier in the day, according to records filed in court.
Kazmark’s mother was devastated. Like other victim relatives we spoke to for this story, Mary Kazmark tried as best she could to summarize a life into a few words — an impossible task. Her daughter liked to sing, travel, cook, draw, snow-ski, water-ski, wakeboard, hike, read, entertain friends and plan parties. She was a responsible kid, her mother said, always the designated driver with her friends. She oversaw guest reservations at one of the Mammoth Lakes lodges.
Mary Kazmark said she tracked down Daugherty on the phone a few days after the crash.
“He just said, ‘I can’t believe this happened again.’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’”
She eventually learned it wasn’t the first time Daugherty’s driving had killed.
In August 2009, in a strikingly similar incident, Daugherty was speeding along a Riverside County highway when his Ford Expedition drifted onto the shoulder. Witnesses told police he veered back to the left, lost control, hit a dirt embankment and went airborne, the SUV flipping onto its roof. A 16-year-old girl riding in the back died. Daugherty was convicted of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. He was sentenced to 180 days in custody and three years’ probation, according to a summary of the case filed in court.
Because of the earlier manslaughter conviction, police recommended he be charged with murder for the death of Krystal Kazmark. But the Mono County district attorney’s office charged him with a mere misdemeanor.

Felony charges typically require a prosecutor to prove “gross negligence.” A prosecutor in another county described the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor this way: A felony is one in which you tell the average person the facts and they say, “Wow, that’s really dangerous.” A misdemeanor is one which they say, “That’s dumb but I’ve probably done it.”
The Mono County district attorney’s office refused to comment on the case, because the prosecutor and the elected DA at the time have both since retired. The office did provide a prepared statement explaining the charging decision. “It was determined that there was not a substantial likelihood of conviction at trial,” it said.
Daugherty pleaded guilty and was convicted in January 2023. He was sentenced to a year in jail. The DMV suspended his driving privileges after the fatal 2020 crash, a DMV report shows. But losing his license wasn’t enough to keep Daugherty off the road, records show.
Two months after his conviction for killing Kazmark, before he reported to jail, police caught him driving on a suspended license.
Still, the DMV reissued Daugherty a license in July 2024.
To recap: That’s two convictions for two dead young women, plus a conviction for driving on a suspended license, and the California DMV says Daugherty can still share the road with you. 
“It’s so sad. You make a mistake and then you don’t learn from it and then you cause another person to lose their life,” Mary Kazmark said. “It’s unbelievable that he can continue to drive.”
Orrock said the DMV couldn’t comment on individual drivers. 
When law enforcement reports a fatal crash, the agency’s driver safety branch flags all drivers who might be at fault. It then looks into the collision and decides whether the agency should suspend those motorists’ driving privileges. If the driver contests the action, there’s a hearing that could include witness testimony. Suspensions are open-ended. Drivers need to ask for their license back, and agency personnel decide whether the suspension should end or continue. These discretionary suspensions typically last for about a year.
And while officials said the DMV can continue a suspension if they think a driver poses a danger, Orrock said they need to give drivers an opportunity to get their license back. He said there’s no process in the state “to permanently revoke a license.”
Get your license back, get in trouble again
Roughly 400 drivers accused of causing a fatal crash since 2019 received a ticket, got in another collision or did both after the date they allegedly killed someone on the road. (The reports don’t show whether the drivers were found at fault, only that they were involved in an accident.) That’s about 15% of the drivers for whom we could get DMV reports. 
Drivers like William Beasley.
From 2011 to 2016, Beasley collected five speeding tickets and a citation for running a red light in Sacramento County, court records show. Then around 9 a.m. on a sunny Tuesday in October 2019, he killed a man.
William and Deborah Hester were crossing the street to go to a dentist appointment at a veterans facility when Beasley’s silver pickup sped toward them. They thought they would make it across. But the truck didn’t stop. At the last minute, William Hester shoved his wife out of the way. She heard the truck smash into her husband’s body and screamed, according to court records.
Beasley still didn’t stop. He fled the area and tried to hide his truck. Investigators used nearby cameras and license plate readers to track him down days later. Beasley admitted to being in a collision.
He later pleaded no contest in Sacramento to hit-and-run and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. A probation report in the case revealed Beasley was nearly blind in his left eye.

“Mr. Hester is with me every moment of my life,” Beasley said in an interview. “I took away a father, a grandfather, a husband, and they consider me a murderer. That’s not who I am.”
“My accident with Mr. Hester was just that, an accident. Nothing more,” he said, adding that he worked as a courier for years and sometimes got speeding tickets because he was rushing.
In May 2020, the DMV took away his driving privileges. 
In November 2022, Beasley got his license back — “because I could and I needed to,” he said, adding that people deserve second chances, particularly for accidents.
Almost immediately — less than three weeks after getting his license — he was in another collision, his DMV report shows. In early 2024, he got in yet another. His license was suspended when his car insurance was canceled, records show.
“It makes no sense to me that they would give him a license and give him the opportunity to hurt someone else,” said Loriann Hester Page, William Hester’s daughter.
Her father’s death broke the family, she said. He drove a tank in the Army, played guitar in a band, liked to ride horses.
“My dad was such a wonderful, kind man,” she said. “He would always walk in a room and wanted to make everyone smile.”
Beasley said he doesn’t plan to drive again.
“I am 75 years old,” he said. “I am blind in one eye. I have had a situation where a man was killed, he lost his life. I am not going to repeat that situation at all.”
Still on the road, license not suspended
The DMV does have the ability to act quickly. In some cases, it suspended a driver’s license shortly after a fatal crash. However, we found numerous cases in which the DMV did nothing for months or years, often not until a criminal conviction.
In July 2021, truck driver Baljit Singh drove his semi on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County, court records show. There are no suspensions listed on his DMV record during that time, even though the agency has the discretion to suspend someone’s license without a conviction. 
Less than a year later, as his case wound its way through the slow-moving court system, Singh plowed his semi into the back of a car in Fresno County, killing a woman, records show. He ultimately pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter in Kern County. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in Fresno for the second fatal crash. The DMV finally took away his driving privileges in February of last year.
Prosecutors say Jadon Mendez was speeding in December 2021 in Santa Clara County when he lost control and caused a crash that killed a mother of three young children. A few weeks later he got a speeding ticket. And yet, the DMV issued him his current driver’s license on Jan. 27, 2022 — 49 days after the fatal crash. 
There were no suspensions listed on his DMV record as of early this year, even though Mendez was charged with manslaughter in May 2022. The judge in his case ordered him not to drive, as a condition of his release. But such court orders don’t necessarily show up on a driver’s DMV record. 
That might be why he didn’t get in more trouble in December 2022 when he got a speeding ticket in Alameda County. Prosecutors didn’t know about that ticket until CalMatters asked about it, said Angela Bernhard, assistant DA in the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office. 
Mendez’s manslaughter case is still open, and his license is still listed as valid. 
When asked about the Mendez case and others, Orrock acknowledged that while there’s a DMV process for deciding when to revoke or suspend a license, “sometimes the process takes a while to happen.”
When the DMV doesn’t act at all
In many cases, the DMV doesn’t take action even after a conviction.
In May 2022, a semi driver named Ramon Pacheco made a U-turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle, killing 29-year-old Dominic Lopez-Toney, who was finishing his rotations to be a doctor. 
Court records show Pacheco had gotten in trouble behind the wheel before. He had been arrested for DUI in 2009, caused a collision in 2013 and got a ticket in 2016 for making an unsafe turn. It wasn’t enough to keep him off the road. 
Neither was killing a man.
Months after San Joaquin prosecutors charged Pacheco with vehicular manslaughter, he got into another collision for which he was also deemed most at fault.
As the case dragged on, Lopez-Toney’s large but tight-knit family wrote dozens of letters to the court, pleading for justice. Dorothy Toney wrote that, more than a year since her grandson’s death, she was still haunted by images of his “mangled and broken body” and the gruesome details in the police report. “Somedays,” she wrote, “I wish I had been there to gently hold his hands” and “tell him how much I loved him.”
The letters are full of shock and outrage that the driver had faced so few consequences. “Allowing this truck driver to continue driving and engaging in civilian activities with only a mere consequence of probation is appalling,” wrote Lynelle Sigona, the victim’s aunt.
Pacheco ultimately pleaded no contest to misdemeanor manslaughter and received probation. His DMV record as of Feb. 11 indicates his driving privileges were never suspended; his commercial driver’s license is valid.
Pacheco’s defense attorney, Gil Somera, said his client isn’t a reckless driver. His prior incidents are relatively minimal, he said, given the fact that “truck drivers drive thousands and thousands of miles a year.” Pacheco needed to turn around and didn’t think there was another place he could do so, since he was approaching a residential area, Somera added.
Pacheco wasn’t being “inattentive or reckless,” Somera said. “And it’s unfortunate and sad and tragic this young man died because of this decision he made to make a U-turn.”
In the wake of the tragedy, Lopez-Toney’s mother has become an advocate for truck safety. 
“Road safety and truck safety is not a priority right now with our legislators, with our government,” Nora Lopez said. “Changing our mindset, our attitudes, our culture on the roads is not impossible.”

In an interview at her Castro Valley home, she talked about her only child. He was smart and caring, liked snowboarding and animals, loved food. On vacations they would take cooking classes together, Lopez said. He studied molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and was almost done with medical school.
She still has the dry-erase whiteboards in his old room. One is filled with his small and neat study notes; another has what appears to be a to-do list. There’s a note that says “Surgery: 600.” Lopez said that’s when he was due to start his surgical rotation in a San Joaquin hospital, just a couple of days after he died.
She said he just wanted to help people and serve the Native American community as a doctor, a future that a driver snatched away.
“It’s because of a man’s recklessness and carelessness — no regard for humanity,” she said.
While felony manslaughter is an automatic three-year loss of driving privileges, a misdemeanor typically carries no such penalty. It’s discretionary — it’s up to the DMV to decide whether to do anything. And the man who killed Lopez-Toney is far from alone in facing no apparent punishment from the DMV.
We found nearly 200 drivers with a valid license whose DMV record shows a conviction for misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter but for whom there is no suspension listed.
When shown a copy of Pacheco’s current driving report, Lopez sat in silence for several seconds.
“Does this make sense to you? It makes no sense to me,” she said. “With his record, how does he still have a license?”
‘Are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?’
Research on dangerous drivers appears to be thin and largely outdated. 
Liza Lutzker, a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Safe Transportation Research and Education Center, said much of the focus in the traffic safety world is on creating better design and infrastructure, so people who make honest mistakes don’t end up killing someone. 
“I think that the issues of these reckless drivers are a separate and complex problem,” Lutzker said. “The system we have clearly is not working. And people are paying with their lives for it.” 
Jeffrey Michael, who researches roadway safety issues at Johns Hopkins University and spent three decades working at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said he understands officials might be hesitant to impose harsher penalties more broadly, “for fear of the unintended consequences.”
“We live in a society where driving is really essential,” he said. But he said the findings show the agency needs more scrutiny and analysis of who is on the roads. 
“These are not unresolvable problems,” he said.
Leah Shahum, executive director of the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit promoting safe streets, said sometimes officials prioritize preserving people’s ability to drive rather than ensuring safety. 
“We don’t all have the right to drive,” Shahum said. “We have the responsibility to drive safely and ensure we don’t hurt others.” She added that many people need to drive in this car-centric state. “That does not mean there can be a license to kill.”
“If we know somebody has a history of dangerous behavior,” she said, “are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?”

The gun metaphor was common in the thousands of vehicular manslaughter cases we looked at across California. One prosecutor described dangerous behavior behind the wheel as akin to firing a gun into a crowd.
In letters to the court, surviving relatives and friends described the hole left behind, writing about an empty seat at a high school graduation, a photo cutout taken without fail to home baseball games.
It’s a void one young man tried to explain to authorities — the sudden, violent, blink-of-an-eye moment where life forever changes. For him, it was at 6:45 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2020, on Lone Tree Way in the Bay Area city of Antioch.
Two brothers, ages 11 and 15, were going to meet their dad at a Burger King. They crossed to the median and then waited for a break in the traffic before continuing to the other side. The older one made it across, according to court documents. His younger brother stepped into the street just as a driver gunned his car to 75 miles an hour — 30 over the speed limit. 
The older boy watched as his younger brother “just disappeared.”

Silvia Paz
Silvia Paz is the founder and executive director of Alianza Coachella Valley, and was the chair of the governor’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Lithium Extraction.


I grew up in the Salton Sea region in a mobile home community of farmworkers. Our corner of the unincorporated town Mecca lacked access to transportation, grocery stores, health clinics, sidewalks, reliable electricity and sewer or water infrastructure. 
Over the decades, change has been slow. It would take substantial, sustained funding to address the dire economic, health and environmental needs.
Communities in the Salton Sea are united by more than our historic underinvestment, though. Despite being artificially separated between Imperial and Riverside counties, we have similar cultures, ecosystems and economic drivers like agriculture and tourism. In many ways, the experiences and priorities of Salton Sea communities have more in common with each other than with the larger metropolitan regions assigned to us. 
We must find a way to overcome the economic regions that divide us based on county lines. Creating a stronger future for the Salton Sea depends on our unity, especially as we navigate the uncertainties of the lithium industry, and as the state prepares to disburse $10 billion from the climate bond that California voters passed in November. 
When separated between Imperial and Riverside counties, our community’s voices are drowned out by the priorities of more-resourced metropolitan areas. For areas comprised of neighborhoods and mobile home parks that consistently rank in the state’s lowest income quartiles, this deepens our competitive disadvantage, and blocks us from accessing resources that are so crucial to bolstering fundamental infrastructure.
Our current experience with the lithium mining boom is a perfect example. Salton Sea communities will be closest to the environmental impacts of lithium extraction. Yet, we have no guarantees or assurances that the major economic benefits developers have long touted will also reach our communities. 
Instead, we’re left negotiating for the basics, like road and bridge repairs to handle heavier industrial traffic. Every community should have functional roads. We should not have to negotiate with developers to fulfill this fundamental need, especially one that supports their business and financial success. 
The reason we don’t have the building blocks for a thriving economy — the reason we’re asking developers for the basics — is directly tied to the economic regions where the state has placed us, fragmenting the flow of public funding into our communities over the years.
Being recognized as one region would provide a spark of hope and a pathway to overcome the obstacles hampering the access to resources. In 2024, the Salton Sea region came together to ask the state to elevate our geographic area to a fully recognized economic region. While these initial efforts were ultimately vetoed by the governor, local governments and community leaders are exploring other ways to make our fractured voices louder and advocate as one for what we all need.
Alongside researchers from the University of Southern California, we are working to unearth areas of common interest between communities and local governments. We are currently focused on Imperial and Riverside counties, as well as the cities of Brawley, Calipatria, El Centro, Westmorland and Coachella. 
Already, our research is revealing promising opportunities for us to advocate together around shared goals. For example, every single one of these areas wants to prioritize upgrading their water systems — which happens to be a primary investment focus of the climate bond.
All around the Salton Sea, my neighbors and I have pride in our histories and cultures. We feel a deep connection to our neighborhoods and agree that stronger infrastructure, clean water and clean air are essential. We are determined to make progress on strengthening our collective voice to meet our shared needs, and we urgently hope our partners in state government will follow. 
A united and recognized Salton Sea region is the key to ensuring our communities benefit from new climate investments and major industrial development. It is key to realizing our potential so this important area of California’s future can truly thrive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020323-Geothermal-Lithium-AD-CM-27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137

The UC says others were restored, too.","In summary
The National Institutes of Health restored a leading University of California researcher’s $36 million grant studying dementia on Friday after terminating it three weeks ago as part of the Trump administration’s DEI purge. The UC says others were restored, too. 


The National Institutes of Health reversed its termination of a $36 million grant to a UC Davis researcher studying dementia, a day after CalMatters wrote about the cancelled grant and the researcher filed an appeal. 
The National Institutes of Health cancelled the grant last month, following the Trump administration’s ban on federal spending on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.Charles DeCarli, a neurologist at UC Davis and lead researcher on the project, got a notice from the agency Friday morning that he could again use the grant’s funds and conduct his research. The agency gave no reason for the reversal. The project included 1,700 participants with mild cognitive impairments plus 28 research and clinical sites across the country. 
The notice came after DeCarli and UC Davis officials submitted an appeal contesting the termination Wednesday night. A CalMatters story detailing the fallout from his grant’s cancellation ran Thursday morning.DeCarli’s grant was among the roughly 30 projects that the National Institutes of Health cut at the University of California since February. Those projects included developing a coronavirus vaccine, studying HIV prevention and assessing how racial discrimination affects the health of older gay men. The UC grants were worth $173 million and the terminated portions totalled $38 million. Nationally, the agency killed off more than 700 grants. The NIH is the world’s largest funder of health science research.On March 21 the agency canceled DeCarli’s grant and froze about $10 million in remaining funds it awarded the project last September. With the grant funds frozen, the ongoing work of evaluating the current participants through MRI imaging and blood analysis ceased.The NIH’s termination letter said that DeCarli’s work “does not effectuate NIH priorities” — a phrase used in letters to other researchers whose grants were terminated.DeCarli’s research project focused on understanding how dementia affects all Americans and considered demographic details that included not just race and ethnicity but also education levels and where in the U.S. individuals live. The NIH awarded him the grant in Trump’s first term. The grant application required that projects reflect the “gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the United States.”
State, national lawsuits against NIH cuts
California’s attorney general sued the NIH over the cancellations on April 4, joining a coalition of 15 other state attorneys general trying to force the agency to reverse their rescissions. The lawyers argue that the cuts violated a law passed by Congress and are unconstitutional. It’s one of the growing list of legal actions the state has taken against the Trump administration in response to federal funding cuts, including health research. Other groups have also sued the NIH, arguing that the agency is illegally conducting an “ongoing ideological purge” by stripping funding from grants it perceives as focused on DEI.The often-conservative editorial board of the Wall Street Journal wrote last week that “taking a machete to research funds and contracts will undermine public support for the (Trump) Administration’s goals.”An article in the highly respected Journal of the American Medical Association warned that President Donald Trump’s campaign to gut research that examines health issues in women and diverse demographic groups may lead to harmful drug side effects. That’s because studies with less diverse participants may not catch genetic or other biological differences that make a drug safe for one group but lead to defects for another. In one infamous case, a medicine whose drug trial excluded pregnant women resulted in thousands of babies born with deformed or missing limbs. The NIH only required that women be included in research it funds between 1989 and 1993, the article said. 
Dementia project still compromised
In addition to DeCarli’s, other grants at the University of California were reinstated, said UC office of the President spokesperson Stett Holbrook on Saturday. He didn’t indicate which ones were brought back or when those notices appeared. But at least one notable grant has yet to be restored: a project studying the benefits and risks of the shingles vaccine at UC San Francisco that received national media attention, said Kristen Bole, a spokesperson for UCSF, on Friday.
Even with the funds returned, DeCarli said it’ll take a month to restore the project’s operations and that the research will likely be permanently limited. His team needed roughly 500 more participants to bolster the scientific analysis. “I’m not sure we’re going to meet that number,” he said. Just before the grant was terminated, his team was recruiting about 90 participants a month. He and his colleagues will lead webinars for individuals who were already participating in the study to explain the pause in research. DeCarli expects some participants won’t return to the study. 
He’ll also need to reestablish subcontracts with other university sites to continue the research. Those include the clinical work at UC San Diego and University of Southern California to recruit participants, draw blood and conduct MRIs; statistical analysis at UC San Francisco and work at UCLA reviewing blood samples.He’s grateful for the legal and administrative work UC Davis and the UC Office of the President provided him in contesting the termination. His appeal was 18 pages and took three weeks to write. In it, he argued that the grant reflected major scientific priorities, including a law Congress passed more than a decade ago to study dementia. He received input from other scientists across the country on how to rebut the NIH. “I have a very strong faith, and it helps to say, OK, God, what do I do here?” he added. “No magic answer” appeared, but the message he felt was, “just hang in there, you know, just help me to let go of something.”
Five million Americans suffer from dementia, which is a loss of the ability to think and remember. While Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, there are others. DeCarli’s work examines the role vascular problems, such as injury to blood vessels in the brain, plays in dementia. At its most serious, dementia causes people to rely on others for basic tasks, such as eating and bathing.
In its original cancellation letter, the NIH wrote that “research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/UC-Davis-Campus-MG-CM-13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137

(Molly Montgomery/Searchlight NM)In January and February, county governments in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and North Carolina began passing resolutions containing nearly identical language. The resolutions oppose what they refer to as an “abuse” of the Antiquities Act of 1906. Enacted by Congress as people went west and frequently looted from historic sites, the law gave presidents the authority to protect any area on federal lands by declaring it a national monument. A deep anti-federal current runs through the county resolutions, and they express support for extractive industries and a general objection to “the designation of lands, whether private lands or government lands as national monuments, wilderness, wilderness study areas, wildlife preserves, open space, or other conservation land.”

Hutchinson regularly communicates with a network of private property rights activists who jokingly refer to themselves as the Secret Meeting. He says that when reporters ask him for the group’s name, “the response might be, ‘If we told you, we would have to kill you.’”

These convictions flow from a right-wing anti-regulatory movement that raged through the 1990s and is surging during the second Trump administration. Those who rally around such ideas believe that the federal government is imposing its values on them, and that public lands would be best-managed by local or state governments — or privatized. Luna County Commissioner Colette Chandler, for instance, who supports the resolutions, believes that a blend of state land management and private ownership would be ideal, and contends that New Mexico should oversee areas in the state currently in federal hands. (See maps below showing various types of New Mexico public lands.) The federal government, she told me, “shouldn’t just be able to dictate to us exactly how to handle our own land, in our own place.”

In March, Chandler delivered copies of the resolutions to lawmakers in Washington, D.C.  Meanwhile, at the highest levels of government, activists and politicians have been lobbying for sales and transfers of federal lands. Last August, the state of Utah filed a case in the U.S. Supreme Court calling for a transfer of lands from federal to state management; the Court ultimately declined to hear it. In January, House Republicans adopted a rules package that simplified the process of passing lands from federal to state and local control. On a menu of options for a reconciliation bill, the House Ways and Means Committee listed “Sell Federal Land” as a possibility, which GOP members of both the Senate and the House are currently debating.
These actions go against what most New Mexicans hope to see. Eighty-nine percent of state residents believe that existing national monument designations from the last decade should remain in place, while 66 percent do not think New Mexico should have control over federal lands, according to a 2025 Colorado College State of the Rockies poll. Every member of the state’s congressional delegation has in various ways expressed support for maintaining federal protections on public lands. In January, Representative Gabe Vasquez co-sponsored proposed bipartisan legislation that would largely ban the sale or transfer of lands managed by the Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service.
“Our cherished public lands should remain in the hands of the public so that New Mexicans and the American public can enjoy them in perpetuity, including national monuments established through the Antiquities Act,” Vasquez said in a March 21 statement. He pointed out that public lands generate billions of dollars in economic activity and support thousands of jobs.

Supporters of federal land management are motivated by a fear that a rollback of protections could make beloved places vulnerable to sale and irreparable harm. “You and I are not going to be the private hands buying up that land,” Luna County Commissioner Ray Trejo told me. “It’s going to be the Elon Musks of the world, the Ted Turners, the Rockefellers.”
Trejo, southern New Mexico outreach coordinator for the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, grew up around Deming. On surrounding BLM lands, during hunting season, he’d spend afternoons and weekends hunting doves and rabbits. As an adult, he hunts quail three or four days a week during the season. Ninety percent of the meat he consumes is venison he harvests. He opposes Luna County’s current version of the resolution, which takes the form of a proclamation, and he hopes to ensure that future generations can spend time on public lands.
To understand the anti-federal sentiment in New Mexico, I started by focusing on the resolutions. Who created them? Was it the county commissioners? A constituent? A think tank?

The federal government currently oversees about a third of all lands in New Mexico. Around 55 percent of that total is managed by the Bureau of Land Management; 37 percent by the Forest Service (which is part of the Department of Agriculture); around 5 percent by the Defense Department; and around 1 percent by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The state is full of important national monuments; some of the most beloved include El Malpais, Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks, Bandelier, the Organ Mountains, the Aztec Ruins and the Gila Cliff Dwellings.

“A fine drafting”
New Mexico counties that have passed versions of the resolution — which is usually called Resolution Opposing Abuse of the Antiquities Act — include Catron, Otero, Hidalgo and Sierra.
It was difficult to reach commissioners who voted in favor of it, and little was clarified when I did. Catron County Commissioner Audrey McQueen approved a version of the resolution in January but told me she couldn’t remember why. She directed me to Catron County Commissioner Haydn Forward. Forward said that Catron County attorneys based their resolution on a Luna County version.
In the conversations I had, a name kept coming up: Howard Hutchinson. Hutchinson is a private property rights activist in his mid-70s who lives in Glenwood, New Mexico. For decades, he’s been arguing that federal lands should be managed by states or privatized. “I am such a staunch believer in private property that any property that is under state control is problematic,” he told me during one of several interviews.

Since the 1990s, Hutchinson has served as the executive director of the Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth, an organization that advocates for private property rights and increased resource extraction. The Coalition’s membership consists of representatives from the ranching and agricultural industries as well as county officials from eleven counties in New Mexico and five in Arizona. (Historically, mining and timber industry representatives also participated, Hutchinson told me, but none are currently active in the organization.)
How county officials are selected for Coalition membership is unclear. At least four Coalition members listed as representing counties on the board are not currently elected officials, and one member, Peggy Judd, a former Republican county supervisor in Cochise, Arizona, pleaded guilty to refusing to certify the 2022 midterm elections. “It’s up to each county commission or county supervisors to appoint a representative,” Hutchinson said. But Trejo said he knows of no public or government process behind the selection, and that he has never received an invitation to join.
Each entity that joins has to pay yearly dues: According to a membership application on the Coalition’s website, counties are charged $2,600, “major corporations” $1,000 and livestock organizations $500. “The industries are basically there in an advisory capacity,” Hutchinson told me. “In other words, we go to them and we say, ‘Will this federal regulation impact X, Y, Z?’ And then we take that information and the data behind their answer to formulate policy.”

Hutchinson initially said that he saw a version of the resolution when Luna County Commissioner Colette Chandler sent it to him. He said she wrote it and shared it with him after Luna County adopted it; he then sent it out through his channels across the U.S. — to other county commissioners, fellow property rights activists and the American Stewards of Liberty, a Texas-based think tank that promotes the sale of federal lands.
Several details conflict with Hutchinson’s account, however. Luna County still has not yet passed the proclamation that represents their version of the resolution. Chandler said that the Luna County attorney, Charles Kretek, drafted the proclamation, and that she didn’t send it to Hutchinson.
A response to an Inspection of Public Records Act request filed in Sierra County turned up an email that Hutchinson sent to members of the Coalition in mid-December 2024. “At our December 11th meeting it was asked that a resolution template be drafted opposing the Antiquities Act counties or organizations can adopt,” he wrote. “Please see the attached template.” The attachment, a Word document, lists “Howard Hutchinson” as its author. (Another public records request returned an email from Commissioner Forward, saying that he had modified Catron County’s resolution from Hutchinson’s version, a statement at odds with Forward’s claim that the resolution came from Luna County.)
When I showed Hutchinson a copy of the template and asked if he knew who wrote it, he said, “I’m not sure who actually wrote this, but it looks like it’s like a template that somebody started circulating.” When I said that the document’s properties list him as the author, and that he circulated it, he said, “I may have taken it and scanned it and pasted it into a Word document.” He said he didn’t remember where he’d scanned it from. In a follow-up email, he wrote: “Well, I did not remember drafting the resolution but upon looking at the original document ‘properties’ I was shown to be the author. Well now I can pat myself on the back for a fine drafting.”
“Unilaterally making a decision”
Hutchinson is behind other county actions calling for an end to federal management of lands. Last October, a couple of months before counties began passing the resolutions, the Coalition and others filed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit seeking a transfer of lands from federal to state control.
The eleven New Mexico counties of the Coalition are named in the brief, though the decision-making process for signing onto the suit was not made transparent. Chaves and Roosevelt counties are misspelled “Chavez” and “Rosevelt” at one point in the brief. At least four counties — Eddy, Otero, Hidalgo and McKinley — posted nothing about the brief on agendas for public meetings between last August, when Utah filed its suit, and January, when the Supreme Court declined to hear it. Catron, Socorro, Roosevelt, Lea and Luna counties listed the matter only on agendas for meetings that occurred after the brief was already submitted. At press time, the Coalition website listed meeting minutes only through last July — the month before Utah filed  suit.

The effort to file the brief was “anti-democratic,” said Mark Allison, executive director of the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, a statewide nonprofit working to protect wildlands. “It seemed like they were unilaterally making a decision without providing the public the opportunity to be aware of or weigh in on that decision about their public lands.” He noted that there are New Mexico Wilderness Alliance members across all eleven counties who do not want to see a transfer of public lands.
When Catron, Socorro, Roosevelt, Lea and Luna included discussion about Utah’s suit on their agendas, they did so to debate whether to contribute financially to the efforts behind the brief — not to debate whether to sign onto it in the first place. In a November 2024 email to Coalition members, Hutchinson wrote that Socorro, Catron and Roosevelt intended to contribute $500 each to fund the “crafting” of the brief and asked if other counties wanted to contribute. Socorro and Roosevelt made public their plans to contribute last October and November, as did Lea County. Catron County Commissioners approved a contribution at a December meeting.
Luna County Commissioners discussed the possibility of contributing but ultimately decided not to pay for the brief, in part out of concern that doing so would violate the New Mexico Anti-Donation Clause, which states that no county “shall directly or indirectly lend or pledge its credit or make any donation to or in aid of any person, association or public or private corporation.”
“I said, not ‘no,’ but ‘hell, no,’” Commissioner Trejo told me. “I wasn’t going to send our taxpayer dollars to Utah.” He believes the New Mexico Attorney General should investigate the counties that did contribute money to support the filing.

How transfer becomes sale
Utah filed its case, Utah v. United States, in the Supreme Court by invoking the Court’s original jurisdiction. (The Constitution allows a state to file a case with the Court when the state is suing another state or the federal government.) After the Court declined to hear it, Gov. Spencer Cox raised the possibility of pursuing it in a federal district court. Even if the state does take that route, legal experts are skeptical it will prevail. The lawsuit tests whether courts, interpreting the Constitution, have the power to order a transfer of federal lands — which is highly unlikely, according to John Leshy, a law professor at the University of California, who wrote a history of public lands called “Our Common Ground.” “The Utah theory is really muddled,” he told me. “I don’t regard this, frankly, as a serious lawsuit.”
But there’s no doubt Congress could get rid of all federal lands, Leshy said. If activists “can create a political movement that catches fire, then from the standpoint of people who love public lands, the worst could happen,” he said. “It is something that’s worth taking seriously.”
Those who call for the transfer of federal lands often say they want the lands to remain public, but under state control, and are not worried that the states would sell off the land. “The states aren’t stupid,” said Commissioner Chandler. “They’re not going to just all of a sudden decide, ‘Well, we can’t have this anymore.’ They’ll decide what’s best for the state, and the state legislation comes from the people, the voice of the people.”

But if Congress were to take action to sell off lands, which are likely worth trillions, conservationists and legal experts are skeptical that they would simply pass the lands to the states. “There’s really no mechanism to dispose of them in that mass quantity right now, so Congress would probably have to take some sort of an action to set up a system,” said David Willms, the associate vice president of the National Wildlife Federation and an adjunct professor at the University of Wyoming. “If you look at the value of those lands, and this is a little bit of speculation, it would be very difficult to get the bipartisan support you’d need to get a bill to pass Congress to just flat give those acres to a state with nothing in return.”
If a transfer to state management were to happen, extraction and privatization would likely follow. Western states, including New Mexico, have constitutional mandates to maximize revenue from state lands. “Because of that, states have very frequently sold those state trust lands, when their land boards have determined that the highest economic value of those lands actually is through selling them,” said Willms. Since becoming a state, New Mexico has sold off four million acres, close to a third of its trust land. The presence of oil under New Mexico’s ground could make management of federal lands profitable for the state — but extraction would then likely occur in places that are currently protected.
The Secret Meeting
Hutchinson regularly communicates with a network of private property rights activists who jokingly refer to themselves as the Secret Meeting. He says that when reporters ask him for the group’s name, “the response might be, ‘If we told you, we would have to kill you.’”
On a Sunday afternoon, we met outside the New Mexico Roundhouse, which, he told me, he’s been coming to for 35 years. “What you’re looking at here,” he said, waving at the structure, “this is corruption at its finest example.”
He does not believe humans have caused climate change. People, because of their “arrogance,” overestimate human impact on the climate, he said. “To surrender my personal liberty to a bunch of grafters in this building, and in Washington, D.C., so that they can pretend to adjust a thermostat for the climate, I have no desire for that.”
Over the course of eight decades, Hutchinson moved from one side of the political spectrum to the other. He was born in Mobile, Alabama, but his family moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico, when he was two, and then to southern California when he was in third grade. His mother was an “avid strict construction constitutionalist,” he told me, and as a young man, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he rebelled against her by becoming a socialist.
He was an early supporter of Earth First!, a radical-left environmental organization founded in New Mexico in 1980 by activists reacting against the moderate tactics of the conservation movement. Its eco-warriors unrolled 300 feet of black plastic down Glen Canyon Dam to make the structure look cracked, hammered metal into the trunks of trees to stop loggers and dressed up as bears to protest the uranium industry.
“I believed that the collective was the motivating force behind a person’s activities, so centralized command-and-control government was more of a positive than a negative,” Hutchinson said. “I’m 180 degrees out from that.” Even so, he still considers himself an environmentalist. “In my mind and spirit, I am still very much a radical environmentalist, but I have changed my view of what entails being a good steward,” he said.
The shift began in the forest. In the 1970s and ’80s, Hutchinson told me, he contracted with the Forest Service around Glenwood, thinning growth and planting trees and actually living for eight years in the woods. “I got an observational perspective of looking at forest health and how everything in forest health was interconnected as an ecosystem,” he said.
He also read extensively about ecology and forest and species management. “I’m kind of a weirdo. When someone purports giving me a fact, I start researching, looking for science papers.” What he learned eventually led to a disillusionment with Forest Service policy and its misapplication, which hardened into a conviction that the federal government could not be a responsible steward of land.
By the ’90s, alongside staunchly anti-federal activists, Hutchinson was working with the Coalition, which formed at the beginning of that decade. Several of the activists prioritized economic concerns over environmental considerations. Since its early days, the Coalition received funding from mining, timber and livestock interests.
Hutchinson now tends to lead with a call for state management of lands. During our first round of phone interviews, he told me he wants state government to manage federal lands and argued that such management would “give the public greater access” to natural resources.
But when I called a county commissioner who approved of an Antiquities Act resolution in Cherokee County, North Carolina, I learned that Hutchinson views state land management as only the second-best option. The commissioner, an ophthalmologist named Dan Eichenbaum, presented the resolution to the Cherokee County Commission after Hutchinson shared it with him. He runs a website called Dr. Dan’s Freedom Forum, which invites visitors to pray for Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance and sells T-shirts that show Trump’s face and read “Guilty of Making America Great Again!” He says that he and Hutchinson are old friends, and he argues that “private property is what separates us from totalitarian governments.”
I found an article Hutchinson wrote on the Freedom Forum last July, calling for the privatization of public lands. In subsequent conversations, he told me he believes private management of all lands would be ideal.
The Antiquities Act
The county resolutions opposing the Antiquities Act describe monument designations as “land grabs.” President Trump used similar language in 2017, calling the designations “a massive federal land grab,” when he rolled back protections on Bears Ears, a place sacred to several tribal nations — including the Navajo Nation, the Pueblo of Zuni and the Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute and Ute Indian Tribes — and coveted by corporations for uranium mining. Using the Antiquities Act, Obama had declared the place a national monument in 2016, and a year later, Trump reduced its boundaries by 85 percent. (Biden restored the boundaries.)
The “land grab” characterization is misleading. The Antiquities Act stipulates that the president can designate any area a national monument on lands that are already federal; monument status gives those lands extra legal protections. In some cases, a president has designated a monument on a recently acquired area after private owners willingly sold or donated their land. But the Act does not give the president the power to condemn and seize land to designate it a monument — and no president has ever done so.
“There’s no circumstance where the federal government, the president, has said, ‘Hey, there’s a bunch of private land, let’s go take it,’” said Justin Pidot, a law professor at the University of Arizona who served in both the Obama and Biden administrations. “There are kid gloves around private property.”
Those who criticize the Act — a group that includes Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts — also feel that the legal protections following a designation are overly restrictive to commercial interests, and that the president should not be able to put such restrictions in place without approval from Congress.

“I don’t think that one man, namely the president in this instance, should have a say over everybody in the country,” said Luna County Commissioner Colette Chandler. “He shouldn’t be able to dictate to us exactly how we’re going to feel about something.” The controversy around the Act in Luna County is especially contentious: one group of constituents hoped that the Florida Mountains, which jut out from federal lands within county borders, would be declared a national monument, while another group rallied against the designation.
But presidents have often issued protections that are less restrictive than what is laid out in law, Pidot notes. And the Act’s stipulations respect pre-existing mining and grazing rights. Designations have usually come about after local groups, tribes or state officials asked for them. The claim that the president has unchecked power to restrict access to land is also not accurate — Congress is able to overturn any national monument designation the president issues. Over the past century, the Supreme Court has upheld Antiquities Act designations several times, in suits whose plaintiffs alleged that presidents had abused their power with the law.
At an April 3 public meeting about the Luna County proclamation, several constituents who spoke against its passage noted its endorsement of extractive industries and voiced concern about the consequences of decreased regulation. (Commissioners and the county attorney may still change the wording of the proclamation; those who spoke at the meeting were referring to a version published in February.) Deming resident Charles Feyh questioned the idea that giving Congress oversight on national monument designations would increase local power and argued that mining and oil and gas industries can more easily influence Congress than they can a president. The “phantom proclamation,” he said, “is not really getting more power to the local people.”
Commissioner Trejo read a statement written by Keegan King, founder of the Native Land Institute, who noted that the Act has often been used to protect sacred indigenous lands. “For more than a century, this law has been one of the few tools that recognizes a deep and enduring connection tribal nations have to our ancestral lands, has protected sacred places, preserved cultural landscapes, ensured that our stories, the stories of this land, are not erased,” wrote King. “To dismantle these protections serves no real public need. It answers no call from the people. Instead, it is driven by corporate interests that view these lands only in terms of extraction and profit.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/floridamountains-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137
,California,2025-04-14 12:28:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers quietly sideline bills in secretive suspense process,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/california-lawmakers-killed-bills/,"More than 100 California bills moved to the “suspense file” last week, the start of a process where consequential decisions are made out of public view.","In summary
More than 100 California bills moved to the “suspense file” last week, the start of a process where consequential decisions are made out of public view.


In just 24 minutes and without any debate, the most powerful committee in the state Senate last week moved 33 bills from public view into a secretive process that will decide whether the measures live or die.
Two days later, its sister committee in the Assembly moved 82 of its bills in under two minutes to the same secretive, uncertain future.
If history is any guide, between a quarter to a third of those bills will be killed next month. For most of the bills, no one but lobbyists, a handful of capital staffers, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s policy team will know exactly why.
So it goes with the Senate and Assembly’s appropriations committees, the gatekeepers for bills proposing to spend taxpayer money. The committees’ “suspense files” are where hundreds of bills die quietly each year. The fates of the bills that were moved to the file last week – along with dozens of others that will be added later – will be announced in a single hearing on what’s known as “suspense day” scheduled for May. 
As CalMatters has reported, members of the Legislature almost never vote in public hearings to kill bills by attaching their names to a formal “no” vote. For instance, of 2,403 bills that died in the two-year session that concluded last fall, only 25 were killed by a majority of lawmakers voting “no.” Instead, bills tend to die behind the scenes. It can be incredibly difficult for members of the public to learn who killed a measure and why.The appropriations committees’ suspense files are the most notorious example. 
The opaque process frustrates some lawmakers, including Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Democrat representing Moreno Valley. He has criticized Democratic leadership for not doing more to address homelessness, inequality and people moving out of state.
“The way we treat the appropriations process is a non-democratic process; I believe that it’s a corrupt process,” Jackson said.
Per decades-old policy, any bill that’s estimated to cost taxpayers at least $50,000 gets placed on the suspense file. Twice a year – once in May and again in August – the committees announce which bills move bills off of “suspense” and can advance through the Legislature.
Last summer, the committees culled about a third of the 830 bills that had been placed on suspense. Some of them were controversial.Republicans were outraged that the committee didn’t vote on their bill seeking to add new requirements before state officials could place “sexually violent predators” in communities.
The Senate’s top Republican, Sen. Brian Jones of San Diego, accused Democratic leaders of protecting “predators over families.”

But some Democrats, including Jackson, also were frustrated. Jackson had a child tax credit bill die in the suspense file. Asked last week if he knew who was responsible for killing the bill, Jackson said, “That’s part of the process. You don’t know in many cases.”
When cost estimates kill California bills
Other Democrats last summer also accused the Newsom administration of inflating cost estimates to kill health care legislation the governor’s team didn’t like through the suspense process. The Newsom administration insisted its estimates were accurate. 
“The administration looks forward to tackling some of the most pressing policy challenges with the Legislature, but doing so within the confines of our budgetary constraints,” Christian Beltran, legislative director for Newsom’s Department of Finance, told the Senate Appropriations Committee last week.Last week, the 82 bills that moved to the Assembly appropriations suspense file included measures on overnight parking for homeless students, vending machine prices in prisons and corporate homeownership.
In the Senate committee, measures on indigenous missing persons cases, gun-dealership inspections and the formation of a California Latino Commission were all moved to the suspense file.
Now the behind-the-scenes work begins for lobbyists such as Chris Micheli, who is advocating for a bill that was moved last week to suspense.
“You’re going to have conversations with the staff of the committee and the members of the committee, particularly the chair, who is most influential in terms of what bills, you know, stay or go,” Micheli said.
Appropriations chairs make hard calls
Former chairs of the appropriations committees – called “approps” in Capitol shorthand – told CalMatters it can be a difficult position to be in. The chairs often have to make tough decisions to kill particularly controversial, poorly thought out or expensive bills that the leaders of the other legislative committees didn’t want to make.

“I would get angry with people,” said Lorena Gonzalez, a former Democratic assemblymember from San Diego who is now president of the California Labor Federation. “I’d have policy (committee) chairs come to me and they’re like, ‘Oh, I couldn’t kill these. But here are the bills I think you should kill.’ I’m like, you know, ‘Grow some balls.’ ” 
Plus, chairs also have to deal with colleagues who take it personally when their favorite bills are killed.
Mike Gatto, a former Democratic Assembly appropriations chair from Los Angeles, said he faced intense blowback from some colleagues. He said one fellow Democrat targeted him during a reelection campaign after Gatto killed his bill in suspense. Another retaliated by killing one of Gatto’s bills in a different committee.
“My mandate was to engage in a cost-benefit analysis for the good of the state, to make sure that we did not spend any more than we had,” Gatto said. “Maybe I took the mandate too seriously, or maybe I was not that great with managing human relationships, but I ended up having a number of very upset colleagues.”
Gonzalez said she didn’t think it was fair to call the suspense file process secretive. She said anyone can review the committee’s fiscal estimates and its analyses and weigh in. 
But in the end, it’s the chairperson who usually has to take the heat.
“‘I think everybody leaves being approps chair with a lot of people upset with them,” she said.

When we began looking into it, we found that while there has been research on infrastructure, technology and engineering solutions, there had been little study of the drivers who cause bad crashes.
So we asked the California Department of Motor Vehicles for data on drivers involved in fatal and serious-injury collisions. The agency said it would cost thousands of dollars and take many, many months to provide such data. One reason: The DMV would have to pay outside technical experts to query its own database, which dates to “the late 1970s and is built, at least in part, on programming language that dates back to the 1950s,” said Joseph Chapman, attorney with the agency.

How we did it: Reporting on California’s deadly drivers


We then tried to get accident reports from cities, but those aren’t always public records. 
As a workaround, we went to all 58 county district attorneys’ offices in the state and asked for lists of vehicular manslaughter and homicide cases filed from 2019 through early last year. That’s a subset of fatal crashes. Roughly 1 in 5 fatal collisions appear to lead to a criminal case in California.
The records provided a foundation to study who was causing deadly accidents. But they were just lists. They didn’t tell us the story of each case. To understand the details, we would need to review the court records. However, there’s no centralized system for California court records. We’d have to review them in person.
We sent a team of nine reporters to courthouses throughout the state to review more than 3,600 case files, either on paper or from a computer terminal in the courthouse.
We were able to do this review for all but two counties that had manslaughter cases. Santa Cruz District Attorney Jeffrey Rosell’s office was the only one that refused to release a list of cases. San Bernardino provided us a list, but we weren’t able to review the specific cases — roughly 300 — for a variety of reasons: Files weren’t available in the courthouse, imaged documents weren’t uploaded to public portals at the court, and a clerk said the office lost our request for information on the criminal complaints.
Finally, we needed to understand the driving records of the people charged with manslaughter. 
Under state law, certain information on a driver’s record is public. Generally, that includes accidents and citations within the past three years, DUIs within the past 10 years, and information on any suspensions or revocations that are in effect or were recently lifted. So while the records aren’t particularly helpful in identifying a long-term pattern of reckless driving, they do show recent incidents and a driver’s current license status. 
We put in thousands of requests with the DMV for drivers’ records, using information gleaned from the court records, such as driver’s license numbers and dates of birth. (We weren’t able to search for some defendants, because the web portal for requesting the records only allows for searches of a certain length — some drivers’ last names were simply too long. In other cases, it’s possible we had a bad driver’s license number or other information that didn’t match what is in the DMV’s database.) Ultimately, we were able to get the DMV driving records for more than 2,600 of the motorists charged with vehicular manslaughter or homicide since 2019.
Manually entering information from the reports into our database of deadly drivers, we were able to spot trends. 
We then contacted officials, experts, victims’ families, prosecutors, defense attorneys and drivers accused of causing deadly crashes. We contacted a defense attorney or the defendant — often both — in every case mentioned in the story. Unless noted in the story, they either declined to speak with us or did not respond.
This is the first story of what will be an ongoing series looking at deadly drivers in California and the systemic issues that lead to so many roadway deaths.

Ervin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.
Yet the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.
The DMV routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again. 
We reviewed vehicular manslaughter cases in California from 2019 through early 2024 to understand how the state handles dangerous drivers.
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.
Here are the key takeaways from our investigation:
1. The DMV misses — or ignores — patterns of reckless behavior on the roads that persist for years, failing to stop dangerous drivers before they kill.
The state system that targets motorists who rack up tickets is designed to catch clusters of reckless behavior, not long-term patterns.
The state suspends a driver’s license for accumulating four points in a year, six points in two years or eight points in three years. What does it take to get that many points? Using a cellphone while driving is zero points. A speeding ticket is a point. Vehicular manslaughter is two points.
And while there are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for certain crimes, like DUIs, there is no such requirement for many vehicular manslaughter convictions.
It’s often up to the DMV whether to act. Routinely it doesn’t.
2. Nearly 40% of drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license, according to DMV records.
That’s about 1,000 out of 2,600 drivers for whom we obtained DMV reports, drivers like Joshua Daugherty.

In July 2020, Daugherty drifted onto the highway shoulder while driving near Mammoth Lakes, overcorrected to the left and lost control, court filings show. His Toyota Tacoma cut across the lane into oncoming traffic, where an SUV broadsided it. Daugherty’s girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kazmark, died.
In August 2009, in a strikingly similar incident, Daugherty was speeding along a Riverside County highway when his Ford Expedition drifted onto the shoulder. Witnesses told police he hit a dirt embankment and went airborne, the SUV flipping onto its roof. A 16-year-old girl riding in the back died.
He was convicted of vehicular manslaughter in both cases. The DMV suspended his license after his conviction for killing Kazmark. But it wasn’t enough to keep him off the road. Before he could report to jail, two months after the conviction, police caught him driving on a suspended license.
The DMV reissued Daugherty a license in July 2024.
3. The DMV often takes no action against drivers convicted of killing someone on the road. 
State law requires the agency to strip motorists of their driving privileges for three years after a felony vehicular manslaughter conviction. But there is no such requirement for most misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter convictions. It’s up to the DMV whether to do anything. 
We found nearly 200 drivers with a valid license whose DMV record shows a conviction for misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter but for whom there is no suspension listed.

That includes truck driver Ramon Pacheco, who made a U-turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle, killing 29-year-old Dominic Lopez-Toney, who was finishing his rotations to be a doctor. 
Court records show Pacheco had gotten in trouble behind the wheel before. He had been arrested for DUI in 2009, caused a collision in 2013 and got a ticket in 2016 for making an unsafe turn.
Months after San Joaquin prosecutors charged Pacheco with vehicular manslaughter, he got into another collision for which he was also deemed most at fault.
Pacheco ultimately pleaded no contest to misdemeanor manslaughter and received probation. His DMV record as of Feb. 11 indicates his driving privileges were never suspended; his commercial driver’s license is valid.

In the wake of the tragedy, Lopez-Toney’s mother has become an advocate for truck safety. 
“Road safety and truck safety is not a priority right now with our legislators, with our government,” Nora Lopez said. “Changing our mindset, our attitudes, our culture on the roads is not impossible.”
4. The DMV issued licenses to 150 drivers less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road. 
Prosecutors say Jadon Mendez was speeding in December 2021 in Santa Clara County when he lost control and caused a crash that killed a mother of three young children. A few weeks later, he got a speeding ticket. 
And yet, the DMV issued him his current driver’s license on Jan. 27, 2022 — 49 days after the fatal crash. Mendez’s manslaughter case is still open, and his license is still listed as valid. 
5. Nearly 400 of the drivers charged with killing someone got a ticket or were in another collision — or both — after their fatal crash. 
That’s about 15% of the drivers for whom we got the DMV reports. While the reports don’t indicate whether a driver was at fault in a crash, the records do suggest many drivers continue to drive dangerously even after killing someone on the road. 
A commercial driver drove his semi truck on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County in 2021. Less than a year later, he still had a valid license when he barreled his semi into slow-moving traffic, hitting four vehicles and killing a woman in Fresno County, records show. Another man, sentenced to nine years in prison for killing two women while driving drunk, got his privileges restored by the DMV after being paroled, only to drive high on meth in Riverside and weave head-on into another car, killing a woman.
6. Hundreds of drivers have vehicular manslaughter or related convictions that don’t appear in DMV records.
The apparent error means some drivers who should have had their driving privileges suspended instead show up in DMV records as having a valid license.
Between March 2017 and March 2022, Trevor Cook received two citations for running red lights, got two speeding tickets and was deemed responsible for two collisions, including one in which someone was injured, court records show.
Cook still had a valid license on April 14, 2022, a month after his last speeding ticket, when he blew through a Yolo County stop sign at more than 100 mph, killing Prajal Bista as he passed through the intersection, on his way to work after dinner and a movie with his wife, according to details of the crash that prosecutors included in court filings. Bista was driving the speed limit and on track to make it to work 30 minutes early.
On March 28, 2024, Cook pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter.
The manslaughter conviction — like hundreds of others we found — isn’t listed on Cook’s driving record. The DMV issued Cook his current driver’s license just a month after the conviction, agency records show. Less than two weeks after that, he got a ticket for disobeying a traffic signal.
“It’s stunning to me that eight months later his license is still showing as valid and the conviction for killing someone while driving is not reflected in his driving record,” said Melinda Aiello, chief deputy district attorney in Yolo County. “You killed somebody. I’d think there might be some license implications.”
7. The DMV denied our request to discuss our findings with Director Steve Gordon. 
Gordon instead issued a brief statement: “The modernization of our systems, including the launch of the Driver Safety Portal, reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing accountability and transparency while continually refining our processes to ensure California’s roads are safer for everyone.”
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, said the agency follows the law when issuing licenses. “We use our authority as mandated and as necessary,” he said.
Orrock said the DMV couldn’t comment on individual drivers. But he and agency officials did explain what happens after a deadly collision, a process that’s separate from any statutorily required suspensions following a conviction.
When law enforcement reports a fatal crash, the agency’s driver safety branch flags all drivers who might be at fault. It then looks into the collision and decides whether the agency should suspend those motorists’ driving privileges. If the driver contests the action, there’s a hearing that could include witness testimony. Suspensions are open-ended. Drivers need to ask for their license back, and agency personnel decide whether the suspension should end or continue. These discretionary suspensions typically last for about a year.
And while officials said the DMV can continue a suspension if they think a driver poses a danger, Orrock said they need to give drivers an opportunity to get their license back. He said there’s no process in the state “to permanently revoke a license.”

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.












We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith




Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday criminalizing human cloning 71-4, with 22 abstentions. 
HB 380, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville, makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, to engage in human cloning. Rigsby said during a brief debate on Wednesday that he is not aware of any human cloning happening in Alabama or the United States, but he said that is the direction science is going.
“We stand at a crossroads in science ethics and human dignity. The prospect of human cloning, once confined to science-fiction, now challenges us to make a firm moral and legal stand,” Rigsby said. “While technological advances have provided humanity with remarkable medical breakthroughs, not all scientific possibilities align with what is ethical, just and safe.”

The legislation defines human cloning as “asexual reproduction.” Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, expressed concern on how the legislation would affect in vitro fertilization (IVF). 
“In theory, it could happen accidentally,” Yarbrough said. “This is saying you can’t be intentionally trying to do so?”
Rigsby said the legislation includes a provision exempting IVF from the definition of asexual reproduction.
“They just wanted to make sure that their practices did not fall under what they do as cloning,” Rigsby said.
The crime includes those cloning humans, and anybody that participates in human cloning, including transportation of a cloned cell, according to the bill.
House Democrats criticized the legislation for being unnecessary. Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, questioned if other states have similar laws.
“I just didn’t know if mass cloning was going on,” she said. “I don’t know of anything or anybody that I’ve ever seen come through Alabama that I’d want to clone.”
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Demopolis, echoed Givan.
“This sounds like science-fiction, cloning people,” he said. 
Rigsby said his bill is modeled after a 2003 law in Arkansas. Rigsby proposed a floor amendment to exclude university research on human organs. It passed 79-1.
“We have some universities that are doing some research on organs and they were a little concerned about line 38, ‘generate all or most of the body tissues of a living organism,’” Rigsby said.
The bill now goes to the Alabama Senate.

“Yes, we will build studios,” Democratic state Sen. Roberta Lange told lawmakers on the Senate Revenue and Economic Development Committee, which held a hearing for the bill on Thursday before referring it to the Senate Finance Committee. “We will be making movies. We will be making shows. But that’s just the beginning.”
Lange’s Senate Bill 220 seeks $1.6 billion in public subsidies over 18 years to support the construction and operation of a 34-acre film and production campus planned for a southwest Las Vegas lot owned by the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Nevada’s film tax credit program would jump from $10 million annually to $98 million in three years, then remain at $98 million annually for 15 years.
For that investment, the project is promising $9.8 billion in total production spending and the development of workforce pipelines into new industries. The campus would also include a dedicated media and technology lab for use by UNLV, Nevada State University, and College of Southern Nevada, as well as a second lab focused on creative technologies used both for entertainment and non-entertainment industries like defense and healthcare.
Lange emphasized the project will be built on public land and is a public-private partnership.
“That structure ensures that this development doesn’t just benefit a single company or a single decade,” she added. “It becomes a long-term public asset.”
Birtcher Development is developing the project and would own the buildings on the property. Birtcher would lease the land for 100 years. MBS Group, a film and television studio operator associated with more than 1,000 productions per year in studios across the globe, has signed on as the lead occupant of the studio space.
Consulting firm Camoin Associates estimates nearly 3,000 jobs would be created during construction and around 8,800 jobs would be created permanently. They estimate the total economic output at $33.3 billion over the 18-year period.
About $607 million of that would be directly through new state revenue — commerce, modified business and sales taxes.
Put another way: Camoin estimates that for every $1 of tax credits Nevada would receive $0.38 back in taxes and see $3.31 generated through wages.
SB220 would create a nonprofit called the Creative Technology Initiative focused on boosting Southern Nevada as a leader in video game design and publishing, aerospace and defense, and medical device and healthcare manufacturing. It would establish the UNLV Center for Creative Technologies.
The proposal is inspired by the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies, one of 14 research centers sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense, and the University of Utah’s Division of Games, which has become a leader in the video game industry.
Lange and her partners believe the initiative could tap into DOD and Veterans Affairs contracts and bring in additional billions in new economic investment over the next two decades.
Meanwhile, in Summerlin…
During the hearing for SB220, Lange did not mention the competing film tax credit proposal, Assembly Bill 238. That bill, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Danielle Monroe Moreno, would establish a film and production studio in Summerlin. Sony Pictures, Warner Bros Discovery, and Howard Hughes Holdings are attached to the project.
https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/02/28/largest-public-subsidy-in-state-history-makes-legislative-debut/
Those partners previously worked with Lange on a film tax credit bill introduced in 2023. That bill, which asked for a staggering $4.9 billion in tax breaks over 25 years, languished and never made it out of its first committee, meaning this year’s duo of bills have already gone further.
Lange has previously said the partners “went radio silent” on her during the interim period between sessions and reemerged with a new bill sponsored by other lawmakers. She’s also said she believes the film tax credit bills should be combined.
Like Lange’s bill, the assembly bill was advanced out of the chamber’s revenue committee without recommendation after a lengthy hearing and referred to the chamber’s finance committee.
Either proposal would amount to the largest public subsidy ever approved by the state. Both are being considered at a time when lawmakers are openly worried about revenue shortfalls caused by a downturn in the economy, federal cuts to widely used programs like Medicaid, or both.
Lange acknowledged those concerns in her presentation.
“We are facing real economic headwinds,” she said. “This is not an optimistic time. Instabilities in markets and the economy will affect Nevada more than most. We are all asking ‘where do we go from here?’”
SB220, she added, is “a beacon of hope and a way forward that is visionary and practical.”
Both film tax credit bills are exempt from standard legislative deadlines. The legislative session runs through June 2.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nevada-Studios-Day-Rendering-Looking-east-4-8-23-1-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-14 08:10:12.577072

In South Carolina, a sweeping energy bill passed by the Senate earlier this month includes limitations on incentives for data centers. Senators inserted the restrictions during floor debate before sending the amended bill back to the House.
Whether those limitations make it into state law depends on whether the House agrees with the changes.

Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
In South Carolina, a deal approved by regulators last year allows a Google data center planned near Summerville to pay a special discounted rate that’s less than half of what residential customers pay.
“Even though they’re paying a rate 60% below, they’re consuming so much power that they’re paying a substantial amount of money to the utility,” state Commerce Secretary Harry Lightsey told senators during a hearing last fall.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue.

We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

Congress is considering major cuts to Medicaid that could affect health care delivery around the state.  (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A few weeks ago I started learning Irish via an app.
The lessons progress like any foreign language course. Start with food and water and how to get them. Gloine uisce, le do thoil. A glass of water, please.
Step outside and describe the weather. Tá sé grianmhar. It’s sunny. Or Tá sé dorcha agus scamallach. It’s dark and cloudy.
Then point out buildings. Cá bhfuil an ospidéal? Where is the hospital? And languages. Labhraím Béarla. I speak English.
I don’t know what drew me to this. My mother grew up in County Mayo in western Ireland, but outside of math she never spoke Irish around me. I doubt I’ll use Irish conversationally around the Alabama Statehouse, unless my cousins in Éire get commanded to do some kind of penance on Goat Hill.
But maybe it’s a feeling that the people in charge speak a patois the rest of us don’t.
Take health care.
Alabama has nation-leading rates of death from heart disease and strokes. More Alabamians die from gunfire each year than in New York State. Infant mortality is about twice as high among Black Alabamians as among whites.
Those are the fruits of poverty and systemic racism. Our ability to cope with all this, never great to begin with, is shrinking. Hospitals are closing. OB-GYNs don’t want to come here.
But instead of alleviating this misery, the Legislature seems determined to maintain it. Even exacerbate it.
In the last decade, they’ve forced women to travel hundreds of miles for basic health care. Lawmakers made it easier to get killed by a firearm. They’ve cut off life-saving treatments for gender dysphoria, sitting stone-faced amid parents’ pleas for their children. And their vindictive stubbornness in refusing Medicaid expansion continues to imperil state hospitals.
Now our elected officials want our kids exposed to preventable diseases, in the name of unverifiable “religious belief.”
And they’ve been rather meek about a looming assault on Alabama health care.
Congress is considering massive cuts to Medicaid — up to $880 billion — to pay for tax cuts for wealthy Americans. If they go through with it, Alabama could lose $824 million in funding for the program.
That’s a tsunami on the horizon.
Medicaid covers over 1 million people in Alabama. It pays for about half the births in the state. It’s critical to the functioning of Alabama’s hospitals and nursing homes in Alabama, which pay special taxes to the state to keep Medicaid going.
The program should get over $1 billion in state money next year, but that doesn’t come close to covering the costs. The federal government pays for about 73% of Medicaid in Alabama.
And if that funding gets cut? On paper, the state could raise taxes to replace what’s lost. But come on. This Legislature will not do that. That leaves one option: cutting Medicaid services.
That will hurt everyone because everyone’s health care in Alabama depends in some part on Medicaid. More hospitals will close. Pediatricians will scale back or end services.
The least bad outcome would be longer wait times for basic care. The worst outcome, especially in rural areas, is health care vaporizing. More illness; more avoidable death; more misery.
This ought to enrage our leaders, who lose their minds when a teacher acknowledges the existence of gay people.
But many of them got into government by claiming to hate government. So their vocabulary is an argot with many words for “cuts” and “bureaucracy” and none for “vital program” or “public servant.” They want a government so small that it can’t prevent powerful men from drowning Alabama in a bathtub.
You may remember President Donald Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. The bill he backed included an attempt to turn Medicaid into a block grant program. Enacting that would have slashed Alabama Medicaid to ribbons.
Hospitals and health care providers in the state all but screamed about the grave harm that would do to Alabama. The people who could stop the damage couldn’t understand. Every single Alabama Republican in Congress — eight of our nine representatives and senators — voted to kill state health care.
People who understand the importance of these and other public systems — whether trade or education — know that a conservative number-go-down approach to governance is poison to both the economy and the well-being of the governed.
And by and large, they’re ignored. Because those with power don’t understand.
They’re shoving hard-won expertise aside and tearing through fragile systems of public health care. Programs critical to our safety and well-being, erected over decades, are under attack from people who feel zero duty to those who elected them.
Rebuilding these services could take decades. Those who work to keep us healthy understand this. They have explained the dangers of what our decision-makers are doing in plain English.
But all our leaders hear is Tá sé dorcha agus scamallach. Cá bhfuil an ospidéal?

(File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Jesse Albright, along with his brother and father, has been operating Albright Farms in Baltimore County for decades, producing beef, pork and, more recently, eggs.
But Albright is one of dozens of local farmers who may lose significant business opportunities due to a recent decision to end a federal program that helps food pantries buy locally grown produce for low-income households — which he says would “be a blow” to farmers and the community.
“I think it’s great that we can provide local product to our local community,” Albright said. “It would be a blow to anybody who’s been selling through the LFPA program.”
He’s talking about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, shortened to LFPA, a Biden-era program that gives food banks extra funding to connect with local farmers and use their produce for meal assistance, as local products can be more expensive.
In March, the USDA, under the Trump administration, announced that LFPA program would come to an end in November, withholding millions from Maryland food banks that could affect not only the quality of food provided in meal programs, but also have a financial toll on the dozens of farmers who are part of those agreements.
Meanwhile, more Maryland families are looking to meal assistance programs, according to Meg Kimmel, chief operating officer of the Maryland Food Bank.
“At a time when there is historic levels of need that are not dropping, we cannot have our food distribution totals go backwards,” Kimmel said Friday.
The Maryland Food Bank serves as a meal assistance hub for a majority of the state, connecting with local food banks and pantries to expand outreach for families needing extra help putting food on the table. The Maryland Food Bank has LFPA agreements with 44 local Maryland farmers, and receives about $4 million through LFPA every 18 months.

Without those additional dollars, the Maryland Food Bank will have to “try to spread our dollars more broadly,” which will likely mean fewer purchases from local growers.
Capitol Area Food Bank is Maryland’s other food assistance hub, serving Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. The Maryland Food Bank covers the rest of the counties and Baltimore.
There are 33 local Maryland growers and farmers that work through the LFPA program with the Capitol Area Food Bank, which receives over $5 million from LFPA.
In a written statement Friday, Capital Area Food Bank CEO Radha Muthiah, said that “in Maryland alone, the LFPA has so far enabled CAFB to purchase and distribute more than 3 million meals worth of fresh local food, including items that we typically haven’t been able to offer to our clients due to higher costs.”
“The program has also been beneficial for farmers, giving them more certainty that they have a market for the foods they’re producing,” Muthiah said in the statement.
Albright can attest to that. Albright Farms entered an LFPA agreement with the Maryland Food Bank during the COVID pandemic, providing eggs for the food bank.
He said that the partnership with food banks through the LFPA program can help small farms, such as his own, build up production because they’re “growing product with the intent that they’re going to sell it to the food bank.”
“They’re putting an extra field of cabbage or tomatoes or sweet corn — whatever that product might be. They’re putting in additional acres and additional crop specific for the food banks that they’re selling to,” he said. “It’s no different with us and the chickens … We started small and as they’ve asked for more, we’ve grown our product more.”
Kimmel calls the LFPA a “win-win” for the food bank, families, and the local economy.
“We were able to leverage federal dollars to do things that we haven’t been able to do. We haven’t been able to buy highly-nutritious local food and pay farmers and producers a fair wage for their work. It was prohibitively expensive for us in the past,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s an economic stimulus program that has benefited our food system – there is nothing else that I have seen in the many years of being in this work that is remotely close to this,” Kimmel said.
If the LFPA program comes to an end on Nov. 30 as currently planned, Kimmel and the food bank will have to make hard decisions on how best to stretch their available funds. She said the first cost-saving action would be to invest in more fresh produce – which would be cheaper than protein, milk and eggs – but their goal is to sustain the number of pounds of food delivered to families. Asking for more donations would be a last resort for them.
Kimmel hopes the Trump administration will reconsider, and restore the program or create a new one that would achieve the same goals as the LFPA.
“It’s not just about buying food, it’s about investing and building in a stronger food system for our tiny little state, which I think is pretty magical,” she said.
Albright would also like to see the program continue, but he and his family are already talking about how to adapt if the LFPA agreements fall through.
“I think farmers have learned to be adaptive,” Albright said. “We try to plan – but I can’t plan for Mother Nature, so I think we’ve learned as a whole, farmers have to become adaptive to the ever-changing environment that we’re operating in.
“If we end up in a tight spot, we’ll have to figure it out,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4591-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 08:10:12.577072

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A Montgomery County Circuit Court Tuesday allowed lawsuits alleging the Alabama Department of Corrections and the University of Alabama System conspired to illegally harvest their loved ones’ organs to move forward.
Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge J.R. Gains rejected a motion from the defendants that argued the individuals and entities named in the lawsuit had civil immunity.
“While state officials are immune from certain claims in their official capacities, they are not entitled to sovereign immunity from civil liability in their individual capacities when their actions violate constitutional or statutory provisions, or when they act willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond their authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of law,” Gains wrote.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs and a spokesperson for the University of Alabama Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine declined comment. A message was sent to the Attorney General’s Office seeking comment.
The plaintiffs allege that the state took control of their loved one’s bodies after they died in prison and conspired to confiscate the deceased’s organs. The suit also alleges that both ADOC and UAB financially gained from the practice and never got permission from the deceased individuals’ families.
In 2018, a group of medical students at UAB noticed that a significant number of the specimens they encountered came from autopsies performed on individuals who died while incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
After further investigation, the lawsuit alleges, the students learned that “23% of their yearly income comes from Department of Corrections autopsies, and 29% comes from Alabama Department of Forensic Science,” according to the plaintiffs’ lawsuits.
The original lawsuit states that students also learned that the warden has the authority to request autopsies and to set limits on those autopsies, but it was routine for the warden to sign the paperwork indicating that no limit be placed for the autopsies performed.
Representatives of the opposing parties in the case verbally sparred over the motion during a hearing in February.
Attorneys for ADOC and the university said that their clients had absolute immunity that stems from the Alabama Constitution. They also challenged other aspects of the plaintiffs’ lawsuits on other grounds that included heightened pleading standards or because facts specific to the case did not apply.
For example, the defense attorneys argued  a conversion claim, based on the illegal taking of property, be dismissed because conversion does not apply to organs or human tissues.
“The Alabama Constitution states that ‘the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity,’” attorneys for the defendants wrote. “This ‘wall of immunity’ is ‘absolutely impregnable’ with regard to the State of Alabama and its agencies, and it may not be waived.”
The defendants also argued a two-year statute of limitations on civil action had expired and barred the plaintiffs from proceeding with the case.
Gains rejected the statute of limitations argument in his Tuesday order, saying the suit was filed within the appropriate time frame.
Gains also said that the families had shown evidence that the state’s Uniform Anatomical Gift Act had been violated, and that they offered “more than mere circumstantial evidence of conspiracy in their complaints.”

Before the 2000s, RadioShack was the place to go if you needed a cable or help with anything tech related. Now, the last brick-and-mortar store in Maryland is closing its doors.
“I’m not one to sit at home, so I’m going to find something to do,” said Cindy Henning, the store’s manager and sole employee.
After more than 40 years, the RadioShack in Prince Frederick is shutting down.
Henning told WTOP she’s going to miss it dearly. She’s worked there for three decades.
“We would have a lot of fun. That was half of our day was to have fun with people and show them how electronics work,” Henning said.
It was owned and operated by longtime local resident Michael King, who passed away at the end of January at the age of 79. His son Edward has taken over as owner.
“It’s the end of an era,” he said.
King said his grandfather owned a TV repair shop in the ’50s and then his dad worked with him. They started carrying RadioShack products and grew to franchise three stores in Maryland.
The RadioShack franchise first declared bankruptcy in 2015. King said they used the RadioShack name, but they don’t have a warehouse in the U.S., so they were buying product from other wholesalers and selling it.
“It was fun while it lasted, but it’s not the same anymore,” King said. “I know my dad realized that.”
The store’s last day is Saturday, April 26.
Henning said she really enjoyed her job and fixing items for customers.
She said that since she didn’t go through training, Edward’s father said she couldn’t officially be a repair tech. But through the years, she honed her skills.
Before he passed away, she said he was incredibly impressed with her growth.
“Last year, (Michael King) informed me, ‘I can’t give you the title because you didn’t go to college, but you do a heck of a good job repairing things and fixing it and taking care of people,’” Henning said.

If you were to drink improperly recycled toilet water, it could really hurt you — but probably not in the way you’re thinking. Advanced purification technology so thoroughly cleans wastewater of feces and other contaminants that it also strips out natural minerals, which the treatment facility then has to add back in. If it didn’t, that purified water would imperil you by sucking those minerals out of your body as it moves through your internal plumbing.
So if it’s perfectly safe to consume recycled toilet water, why aren’t Americans living in parched western states drinking more of it? A new report from researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Natural Resources Defense Council finds that seven western states that rely on the Colorado River are on average recycling just a quarter of their water, even as they fight each other and Indigenous tribes for access to the river amid worsening droughts. Populations are also booming in the Southwest, meaning there’s less water for more people.
The report finds that states are recycling wildly different proportions of their water. On the high end, Nevada reuses 85 percent, followed by Arizona at 52 percent. But other states lag far behind, including California (22 percent) and New Mexico (18 percent), with Colorado and Wyoming at less than 4 percent and Utah recycling next to nothing.
“Overall, we are not doing nearly enough to develop wastewater recycling in the seven states that are part of the Colorado River Basin,” said Noah Garrison, a water researcher at UCLA and co-author of the report. “We’re going to have a 2 million to 4 million acre-foot per year shortage in the amount of water that we’ve promised to be delivered from the Colorado River.” (An acre-foot is what it would take to cover an acre of land in a foot of water, equal to 326,000 gallons.)
The report found that if the states other than high-achieving Nevada and Arizona increased their wastewater reuse to 50 percent, they’d boost water availability by 1.3 million acre-feet every year. Experts think that it’s not a question of whether states need to reuse more toilet water but how quickly they can build the infrastructure as droughts worsen and populations swell.
At the same time, states need to redouble efforts to reduce their demand for water, experts say. The Southern Nevada Water Authority, for example, provides cash rebates for homeowners to replace their water-demanding lawns with natural landscaping, stocking them with native plants that flourish without sprinklers. Between conserving water and recycling more of it, western states have to renegotiate their relationship with the increasingly precious resource.
“It’s unbelievable to me that people don’t recognize that the answer is: You’re not going to get more water,” said John Helly, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who wasn’t involved in the report. “We’ve lulled ourselves into this sense of complacency about the criticality of water and it’s just starting to dawn on people that this is a serious problem.”
Yet the report notes that states vary significantly in their development and regulation of water recycling. For one, they treat wastewater to varying levels of purity. To get it ultra pure for drinking, human waste and other solids are removed before the water is treated with ozone to kill bacteria and viruses. Next the water is forced through fine membranes to catch other particles. A facility then hits the liquid with UV light, killing off any microbes that might remain, and adds back those missing minerals.
That process is expensive, however, as building a wastewater-treatment facility itself is costly, and it takes a lot of electricity to pump the water hard enough to get it through the filters. Alternatively, some water agencies will treat wastewater and pump the liquid underground into aquifers, where the earth filters it further. To use the water for golf courses and nonedible crops, they treat wastewater less extensively.
Absent guidance from the federal government, every state goes about this differently, with their own regulations for how clean water needs to be for potable or nonpotable use. Nevada, which receives an average of just 10 inches of rainfall a year, has an environmental division that issues permits for water reuse and oversees quality standards, along with a state fund that bankrolls projects. “It is a costly enterprise, and we really do need to see states and the federal government developing new funding streams or revenue streams in order to develop wastewater treatment,” Garrison said. “This is a readily available, permanent supply of water.”
Wastewater recycling can happen at a much smaller scale, too. A company called Epic Cleantec, based in San Francisco, makes a miniature treatment facility that fits inside high-rises. It pumps recycled water back into the units for non-potable use like filling toilets. While it takes many years to build a large treatment facility, these smaller systems come online in a matter of months and can reuse up to 95 percent of a building’s water.
Epic Cleantec says its systems and municipal plants can work in tandem as a sort of distributed network of wastewater recycling. “In the same way that we do with energy, where it’s not just on-site rooftop solar and large energy plants, it’s both of them together creating a more resilient system,” said Aaron Tartakovsky, Epic Cleantec’s CEO and co-founder. “To use a water pun, I think there’s a lot of untapped potential here.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-14 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"The perforated wall between church, state and community",Doris Maldonado Mendez | Opinion Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/14/the-perforated-wall-between-church-state-and-community/,"When faith-based and community organizations are excluded from public discourse, vital services can suffer.","“With sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to members of the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802.

My values are deeply rooted in a love of God, Familia, and country. My mom was a devout Catholic and my father a proud veteran. I experienced Catholic education, peer leadership, and spiritual rites of passage which ultimately led me to teach Catechism for elementary children with special needs (including my own). 
I’ve set examples of Matthew’s golden rule for my children to “do unto others as you’d have done unto you” and established intentional ways that we individually and collectively help “pay it forward” in our community. An inherited call to spirituality and ancestry led me to the Yoruba belief in traditional religions and spiritual concepts of destiny and fate, which ultimately guided me to the inclusive teachings of Unitarian Universalism.


Preaching the golden rule has been significantly challenged this year.  The ripple effects of federal budget cuts are deeply personal for me as someone living with disabilities and navigating the challenges of raising children with medical complexities. Recently, I faced a cut to my own grant-funded work as Project Advisory Committee Lead with Family Voices National, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Project ECHO, and the Office of Minority Health. These organizations play a critical role in advocating for health equity and providing support for families like mine—families that rely on these resources for survival.
The loss of funding is more than just numbers on a page; it translates to real hardships. It limits access to life-saving medical equipment and medications, squeezes vital programs like SSDI and SSI that barely cover living expenses, and forces families into impossible decisions between paying bills or affording necessary care.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
These cuts also strike at the heart of systemic advocacy efforts, silencing voices that have fought tirelessly for inclusivity and equity. Community organizations are left scrambling to sustain services, while families and caregivers bear an overwhelming burden, often at the cost of their own health and well-being.
As past chair of the Accessibility and Inclusion Ministry of the Unitarian Society of Hartford and a worship associate, my family and I engaged in welcoming opportunities of nourishing spirit, building community, and working for justice through a multicultural and neighborly secular blanket. My children participated in civic engagement opportunities with peers and leaders practicing the seven Unitarian Universalist principles.
Community service through faith has been part of human culture since ancient times. Nonpartisan, community-led organizations provide sanctuaries of access, inclusion, and respect for the love of community and its inherent dignity.
When faith-based and community organizations are excluded from public discourse, vital services such as food pantries, housing support, and crisis intervention programs suffer, leaving vulnerable populations without essential aid. 
The lack of meaningful collaboration between government, community and faith organizations fosters division, creating echo chambers that exacerbate misinformation and reduce opportunities for liberty and justice dialogue between diverse groups.
Policies that fail to include faith and community-based organizations in decision-making processes risk neglecting the lived experiences and unique needs of underrepresented populations, further disenfranchising marginalized voices.
Without strong partnerships, voter participation, advocacy efforts, and grassroots movements lose momentum, limiting marginalized communities’ participation in policy and systemic change, and weakening collective civic engagement.
The absence of faith and community perspectives in governance diminishes moral and ethical considerations in policymaking, leading to legislation that prioritizes political gain over human dignity and equity.
I refuse to accept this as the status quo. Advocacy and collaboration must be amplified. Governments, businesses, and grassroots organizations must work together to create innovative solutions—whether through public-private partnerships or stronger protections for disability funding.  As the Constitution State, Connecticut has a responsibility to lead by example, guiding the nation toward stronger collaborative frameworks.  Many community centered groups are already doing this work.  
Since 1830, the Hartford Unitarian Association has long been a beacon of inclusivity and social justice. Through community programs, interfaith dialogues, and advocacy, the society has worked to foster mutual understanding and provide essential services to those in need. By collaborating with other organizations like the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance, we have extended our reach, combining faith-based and secular efforts to create meaningful change. Established in 1876 as Congregation Beth Israel, the Charter Oak Cultural Center’s mission is to tikkun olam, repairing the world through acts of social justice through the arts and lifespan.
Community-led organizations like CoDE, Know thy Neighbor and others aim to further indivisible liberty and justice for all at a micro and macular level.
CoDE, the Coalition on Diversity and Equity, has played a crucial role in bridging the gaps between the state and ALL communities by providing equitable resources, creating opportunities for civic engagement, and advocating for inclusive policies. Our initiatives focus on the practice of indivisible liberty and justice for all by dismantling systemic barriers, ensuring equal representation, and amplifying voices.
Know thy Neighbor’s mission is to bring together Hartford residents with first responders  and others about community concerns, working together to take action that builds trusting relationships and achieves positive community-driven change. 
These groups continue to address the gaps in our social networks by practicing these steady habits:

Hosting community, interfaith and civic dialogues to address pressing social issues
Providing legal aid and advocacy for those facing denied indivisible liberty and justice
Offering mentorship programs to empower youth and emerging leaders
Partnering with local governments to implement policies that promote indivisible liberty and justice for All
Strengthening allyship through active listening, shared resources, and direct collaboration with ALL groups
Utilizing research-based strategies to identify systemic gaps and implement community-led interventions For the People and By the People.

For me, this fight is rooted in my values of faith, family, and community. Despite the challenges, I remain committed to preserving dignity, liberty and justice for marginalized communities. In the words of Isaiah, we are morally obligated as “repairers of the breach, restorers of streets to dwell in.” The system is broken, but not beyond repair as long as we hold these truths to be self-evident that no “state … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”   In solidarity, we solemnly remain “One Nation under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for ALL” because there is nothing about us without us.

Here's what we know so far.","Since the first days of President Donald Trump’s second term, education leaders in Connecticut have watched as the presidential administration rolled out a series of executive orders, funding cuts and changes to federal policy — many of which represent sharp turns for the students, schools and districts they oversee.
Connecticut lawmakers have been vocal about their fears of the worst case scenario: a reduction or outright elimination of the $550 million in federal funding the state relies on to support public K-12 education.
For now, the funding remains mostly intact. But several of Trump’s actions to date — on things like DEI, transgender students and campus protests — threaten federal funding reductions if schools and universities don’t comply.
Here’s what we know so far.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
During President Trump’s first week in office, he issued an order banning DEI across federal agencies. The following week, the president issued an executive order to eliminate “discriminatory treatment and indoctrination, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology” in K-12 schools, calling for federal funding reductions for schools that don’t comply. 
Earlier this month, the issue came to a head when the Department of Education sent a letter calling on state education officials across the country to “certify their compliance with their anti-discrimination obligations in order to continue receiving federal financial assistance.” At the moment, it remains unclear how the Connecticut Department of Education will respond to the request or whether Connecticut will face federal cuts.
The Defense Department has also halted race-conscious admissions at military academies, including the Coast Guard Academy in New London. In February, the Education Department issued a letter threatening to withhold funding from education institutions that take race into account in admissions and programming. In mid-March, Yale University was among dozens of colleges and universities listed in an Education Department announcement alleging the schools engaged in exclusionary practices in graduate admissions.
Dismantling the department
In early March, the Education Department announced it would reduce its ranks by roughly half. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong joined a group of states to sue the administration over the staff cuts, and the case is pending. 
On March 20, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Education Department. Teachers unions quickly sued to block the order and members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have vowed to take action. Trump has said the administration of student loans would be shifted to the Small Business Administration and special needs programs would be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services.
COVID-era funding
Last year, school districts across the country applied for extensions to spend the last remaining dollars of federal COVID-19 relief funding by March 2026 instead of its original deadline of January 2025. But in late March, the Trump administration froze that funding.
Connecticut’s last $14 million was earmarked mostly for programs within the state Department of Education, with just over $6 million of the funds already granted to roughly two dozen K-12 school districts. New London and Waterbury were expected to receive the bulk of those dollars.
The administration has also said it intends to cut funding for schools and universities that require students to be vaccinated against COVID.
Transgender students
During his first week in office, President Trump issued an order ending Title IX protections for transgender students. The following week, the Education Department complied, undoing rules set during the Biden administration. The Trump administration later issued an executive order banning transgender women and girls from competing in women’s sports. Institutions that don’t abide by the ban could see their funding cut, the administration has said.
In late March, the department sent a letter to states threatening to withhold federal funding if parents were not allowed to review student records, in particular any related to the student’s gender identity. In Connecticut, education advocates are seeking stronger protections for transgender students in the wake of the Trump administration’s actions.
Immigration enforcement
In January, the president announced that officers with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protections agencies could make arrests at schools, churches and hospitals — places that had long been considered “sensitive locations,” and barred from immigration enforcement.
Connecticut education officials released guidance to K-12 public schools on how local district leaders should respond to “immigration activities,” including in cases where federal immigration officers request student information or come onto school property.
School meals
Millions of dollars in anticipated funding that Connecticut schools and food banks planned to use to purchase fresh food from local farmers was canceled. The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed state agencies it would no longer run the pair of programs that spend $1 billion each year nationally: the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program and the Local Food for Schools program. 
Campus protests
In late January, the president pledged to cancel student visas of “all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” Weeks later, the Education Department warned 60 colleges and universities they could face repercussions if they fail “to protect Jewish students on campus.” Yale University was among the schools listed on the department’s announcement. Several international students who participated in protests have been detained.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4567-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 08:10:12.577072

(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)Florida attracts sleazeballs, creeps, and the criminally-inclined the way cookie crumbs attract roaches.
It’s always been like this: Al Capone wintered in Miami Beach; Richard Nixon escaped to his Key Biscayne compound so he could hang out with his mob-affiliated pal Bebe Rebozo; Charles Ponzi  made a name for himself for selling Florida swampland — impossible to build on— to unsuspecting Yankees.
More recently, another shady real-estate type, found liable for sexually assaulting journalist E. Jean Carroll and accused of sexual abuse (and worse) by dozens more women, bought a Palm Beach estate and now claims Florida as his home.
So, it’s hardly surprising “influencers” Andrew and Tristan Tate, British-American brothers facing charges of human trafficking and rape in Romania, flew to Florida the minute their travel restrictions were lifted last month — possibly because Trump’s special envoy pressured the Romanian government.
The Tates have fans in TrumpWorld, including lawyer Alina Habba (on the losing side of the E. Jean Carroll case) and Donald Trump Jr., who called their detention “absolute insanity.”
Elon Musk, too: He says Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer who believes women exist only to serve men, should be U.K. prime minister.
But in a rare moment of good sense, Gov. Ron DeSantis bucked TrumpWorld and told those stars of the manosphere they’re “not welcome” in Florida.
Moreover, the state attorney general is investigating certain accusations, including claims they lured a Florida woman to Romania and tried to coerce her into sex work.
Andrew Tate responded by taunting DeSantis on X: “Your wife will never win governor unless you arrest me, @GovRonDeSantis,” calling the governor a “communist” and declaring, “When Americans who are unfairly imprisoned abroad return home you betray them. You better nail me now.”
At least none of our institutions of higher learning have invited the Tates to speak on campus.
Yet.
Socratic dialog
You might keep an eye on New College, though.
Our once-renowned honors school has not exactly covered itself in glory over the past few years, what with dumping top-tier faculty, tanking in the rankings, admitting low-scoring jocks, mismanaging funds, and grossly over-paying its under-achieving president, but inviting British “comedian” Russell Brand to appear its “Socratic Stage Series” adds insult to injury.
Brand was supposed to be “in conversation” with NCF president Richard Corcoran on April 12.
New College announced the Brand appearance in February. On April 4, the British Crown Prosecution Service charged him with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape, and two counts of sexual assault.
In a press release, New College defended bringing in Brand, wrapping itself in the flag of free speech: “After thoughtful consideration, we have decided to move forward with Russell Brand’s scheduled appearance,” citing the institution’s responsibility “to ensure a space where ideas — especially those that invite dialogue such as the topic of cancel culture and free speech, can be explored with respect, critical thought, and intellectual integrity.”
Not quite 48 hours later, New College thought better of it, announcing this “important and possibly never more relevant” conversation would be rescheduled at a later date.
NCF blamed problems with the venue (problems which apparently didn’t exist a few days ago) and those pesky journalists: “the current media climate is a distraction from the deeper purpose of the event to explore free speech.”
Brand has a court date in London on May 2.
Magic amulet
Now, you might be wondering exactly what qualifies Brand to be a guest lecturer for a public college in Florida.
He’s best known as host of a “Big Brother” spinoff called “Big Brother’s Big Mouth,” as the star of several films, including “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” often-fired radio host, and general provocateur.
He used to be a progressive (of sorts), praising Barack Obama, meeting with the Dalai Lama, and saying rude things about George W. Bush, but has lately become a conspiracy theorist who, in 2024, took to selling a $250 “magic amulet” which supposedly keeps you safe from “all sorts of evil energies.”
Right.
There’s this thing we do in higher ed called “research.” You’d think a few minutes perusal of Russell Brand’s baby talk-titled memoir, “My Booky Wook” with gleeful accounts of spitting in a woman’s face and furiously smashing a sex worker’s phone because it kept ringing while they were in flagrante (a service “for which,” says Brand, “I’d paid a lot of money”) might suggest perhaps he’s not someone likely to enrich the culture.
None of this proves Brand is a rapist, but it’s pretty clear he’s a misogynist jerk.
Brand insists that while he was once epically promiscuous, all his liaisons were “consensual,” even the ones with teenagers.
Besides, he says, he has now been washed clean by the Holy Spirit, baptized last year in the River Thames by adventure reality TV star Bear Grylls.
Criminal investigation 
Well, the Lord may have forgiven him, but the justice system doesn’t work like that: In addition to charges in the U.K., Brand faces a U.S. civil suit and possible criminal investigation into allegations that he exposed himself and assaulted a woman on the set of the film “Arthur.”
The question remains: Why is New College spending taxpayer money on this guy?
Other “Socratic” speakers are (mostly) defensible: Steven Donziger, who famously sued Chevron over oil operations in Ecuador which wreaked monstrous environmental damage. (The oil company accused him of misconduct in the case; he spent three years in home detention for refusing to turn over his phone and trial records; Amnesty International fruitlessly urged former President Joe Biden to issue a pardon.)
Also scheduled for appearances at New College are Judith Butler, the distinguished gender theorist, and Stanley Fish, lawyer and literary scholar, disliked by both the right and the left.
There is also, as you’d expect, a bunch of conservatives ranging from the intellectually respectable — Mollie Hemingway, editor of “The Federalist” — to the anti-vax doctor Scott Atlas.
But casting Russell Brand as some free speech hero is flat out stupid.
Milton intervention
It’s not the first time NCF has embarrassed itself. In 2024 the college invited white supremacist “eugenicon” Steve Sailer, who says Black men are in thrall to a “primal African cult of fertility,” to “debate” Black historian Dr. Marvin Dunn.
As if you can argue “both sides” on racism. There are not two sides — unless you think the KKK makes a lot of good points.
When Hurricane Milton forced the cancellation of what promised to be a particularly unlovely spectacle, you could almost believe in the wrath of God.
Despite MAGA hissy fit-pitching and anti-DEI squawking over “censorship” and “indoctrination” on campus, conservative ideas are not suppressed or censored.
FSU recently hosted economist and Reagan acolyte Glenn Loury; the University of Florida’s Hamilton Center has showcased Republican pollsters and American Enterprise Institute luminaries.
This is as it should be.
But there’s a difference between a university fostering honest discussion of academic freedom, ideology, and prejudice, and promoting a man who could soon be convicted of sexual assault.
Scrubbing the record
Florida’s Republican junta has convinced itself higher education turns innocent students into tree-hugging transgender Marxists who read nothing but books on critical race theory.
Terrified they’ll be penalized financially and every other way, colleges and universities have busied themselves scrubbing websites of incendiary words such as “women,” “Black,” “institutional” and “trauma.”
FSU has deleted and “archived” its posts on high-achieving students before 2023, claiming, in fluent bureaucratic nonsense-speak, they did it to get rid of “outdated information to enhance user experience and ensuring our webpages load quickly and efficiently on all devices.”
In case you’re not buying that one, they’re also calling it “routine maintenance.”
A cynical person might think this is really about obscuring official praise of students who might be queer or working in currently disfavored fields of study.
A cynical person might also wonder if state government wants to use higher education to return us to an imagined past when white Christian men were in charge of everything and everything was absolutely great, especially for white Christian men.
One of the governor’s picks for the Board of Trustees at University of West Florida, an institution he calls “a left-wing college,” wanted to take us back to the 1950s.
Scott Yenor, an academic nonentity at Boise State in Idaho, thinks only “non-Jewish white men” should be in leadership positions.
He says “independent women” are “medicated, meddlesome and quarrelsome” and proclaims, “If we want a great nation, we should be preparing young women to become mothers,” not have successful careers, certainly not in the manly fields of science, medicine, and the law.
Even some of Florida’s loudest and proudest reactionaries objected to Yenor’s weird ideas about women and obvious antisemitism.
Sen. Randy Fine, the state’s only Jewish Republican legislator (until he was elected to Congress on April 1) raised the alarm.
Back to Idaho
Indeed, Yenor is so out there that several hundred citizens, including students, alumni, former trustees, and donors, held a town hall in Pensacola — deep red Pensacola — urging the Florida Senate to reject his nomination.
Former Republican legislators, business leaders, donors, local officials, and members of the Jewish community expressed dismay. UWF President Emerita Judy Bense urged people to tell the governor “this is wrong.”
The amazing thing is, they won. Yenor, who had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, withdrew from consideration.
Sen. Don Gaetz, father of the egregious Matt, celebrated Yenor’s decision: “Gentlemen don’t go where no one wants them.”
Unacquainted with what gentlemen do, the governor is throwing a tantrum, blaming Fine, whom he describes as “repellent,” snarling, “Let’s just consider the source. I mean, that same senator called me antisemitic,” and accusing others of distorting Yenor’s record, “trying to dredge up statements” he calls “flimsy.”
Booting Yenor back to Idaho is a small victory for UWF and the basic decency we should expect from Florida’s state institutions.
“Rescheduling” Brand is, too, although New College is probably beyond redemption: Opening the campus to white supremacists and accused rapists does not demonstrate a commitment to vigorous examination of social norms and political pieties, or a bold assertion of free speech.
It’s evidence of decay.

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’ 
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.


We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Photo by Jake Parrish/InvestigateWest)Last summer, Robert Dale Root was charged with violating a no-contact order to stay away from his partner. 
Unable to afford an attorney and facing a dwindling roster of Yakima County public defenders, Root waited three months for a public defender to represent him for the felony charge. His partner repeatedly asked to lift the order, to no avail, as Root posted bail twice — before landing back in jail for violating the order each time. 
He took off work for three arraignment hearings, but he showed up to the hearings without legal representation, only for his arraignment to be rescheduled for a later date. The attorney he was finally assigned met with him just once, complained of being flooded with other cases and left the office before Root’s case was resolved, about seven months after his initial arrest.
He’s since been assigned another attorney and sits in the county jail awaiting a trial date set for April 21.
Root’s wait in the bottlenecked queue for counsel in Yakima isn’t unusual. In fact, it was common last summer, according to court records reviewed by InvestigateWest. One woman arrested the same month as Root and facing a litany of charges related to theft and drug possession was arraigned eight times and waited five months for a public defender. Another defendant, charged with assault, waited five months. Another appeared at four arraignments without a public defender until his case was eventually dismissed. The list goes on.
“It’s not our fault they don’t have enough attorneys,” said Root, a 23-year-old descendant of the Yakama Nation. “We have to sit here and try to await trial because we’re innocent until proven guilty. … It’s just wrong.”
Lags in Yakima County’s court system reflect a breaking point in the state’s public defense system. A shortage of public defenders leaves indigent defendants waiting weeks, sometimes months for an attorney. These defendants often are left in the dark, oblivious to when or from whom they will have legal representation. In Washington, the issue varies by county — namely due to the state’s lack of financial support and the counties’ differing models of service.
“The Legislature has slowly choked the life out of local budgets,” said Derek Young, interim director of the Washington State Association of Counties. “We can’t afford proper staffing levels.”
In what some would call a worst-case scenario, Benton County released five criminal defendants, with charges including rape and other violent crimes, from jail last year because it lacked defense attorneys to represent them.
“That’s where their constitutional right becomes now a public safety problem,” Young said. “The date we’ve been warning (the state) about for a long time has arrived. It’ll start in those places that have the hardest time recruiting attorneys.”
The problem is particularly acute in Yakima County. The county is both being sued by defendants and is suing the state, along with several other counties and the Washington State Association of Counties, for failing to provide adequate funding for public defense services. Young said the decision is in appeal, and he expects another hearing in early May. The director of the Yakima County Department of Assigned Counsel, Paul Kelley, declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.
On Sept. 30, five plaintiffs who languished in Yakima County’s jail without an attorney, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that Yakima County failed to appoint counsel and unlawfully restrained those without legal representation. The plaintiffs faced “onerous conditions of release, and repeated court hearings — where they [were] forced to face the court without counsel — that [did] not move their case forward,” according to the complaint.
That suit came on the heels of a case in August 2024 in which Superior Court Judge Richard Bartheld declared that the defense shortage in Yakima — exacerbated by the departure of four attorneys, roughly a quarter of all of its public defenders — had reached “a crisis level.” In that court case, a woman charged with driving under the influence had lost her attorney and waited three more months for a new one. To prevent the case being dismissed, Bartheld went as far as to amend court rules, declaring that the time spent reappointing counsel would not count against trial deadlines. 
“When relief is not offered through executive or legislative action and the Supreme Court fails to address these issues in its rulemaking authority, it produces problems for trial courts that are unprecedented and unavoidable,” Bartheld said.
Underfunded and overburdened
Washington is among the few states that do not provide the majority of funding for public defense. 
In 1996, the state Legislature established the Office of Public Defense to provide supplemental representation for indigent defendants. Since 2005, the office has also been responsible for dispersing the limited state funding to counties — funding which does not surpass 3% of total spending for public defense services. Total state funding for counties in 2024 and 2025 was about $5.8 million each year.
County revenues collected from property and sales tax make up remaining funds, but in Washington, local governments can only increase their property tax revenue by 1% without voter-approved ballot measures, failing to keep pace with the rising costs of running a court.
“The total revenue that you can generate… [is] beneath the rate of inflation,” Young said. “It turns out your employees won’t work for only 1% increases year over year.”
In Ferry County, one of the least-populous counties in the state with about 7,500 residents, less than 18% of land is taxable. The rest is either reservation or national forest, making revenue from property tax particularly low. Public defense services are managed by county commissioners who contract with one attorney, located over an hour’s drive away.
“Facilities are extremely limited,” said Bob Dean, Ferry County commissioner. “Running [the public defense program] consists of basically, desperately seeking another lawyer if we lose this one.”
Recruitment is another hurdle. Public defenders have a taxing job. A high workload and relatively lower pay makes the job less appealing to law school graduates, said Colin Charbonneau, director of Spokane’s public defender’s office. On top of that, many are not apt to relocate somewhere rural.
In Benton County, “we do not have a law school here locally, the closest one is in Spokane, which is about two and a half hours east of us,” said Keith Johnson, director of the Benton County public defender’s office. “We compete with other counties for talent.”
InvestigateWest obtained 2023 grant applications sent to the Office of Public Defense from 10 rural and three urban counties. All counties, except one that didn’t respond to the prompt, voiced the same concern: Retention and recruitment are struggles.
“The increasing salaries in larger areas has decreased the available attorney[s] in rural communities,” Okanogan County reported in its grant application. “In addition, we continue to lack affordable housing.”
Lewis County blamed the state’s lack of funding for its issues. Its grant application said that “unfunded mandates are absolutely the biggest challenge for counties across the state” and that “other sources of funding will need consideration.”
For years, Yakima’s public defense office has tried to recruit more attorneys. County commissioners repeatedly approved new budgets to offer 20% pay increases, $12,000 in sign-on bonuses and retention bonuses for existing public defenders. Despite the attempts, few applied.

For years, there were warnings. Back in July 2022, Kelley began sending monthly emails to the Yakima Superior Court judge and the director of prosecuting attorneys explaining the difficulty hiring attorneys and that new case filings “outnumber[ed] the closing of felony cases.” In August 2022, Kelley decided to max out the county public defender office’s capacity at 160 felony cases a month, with leftover cases carried over to the next month. 
Seven months later, the leftover cases had grown to 223 — more than 150% of the office’s capacity — causing further delays for new case filings. 
It meant “indigent felony cases first appearing in Superior Court on and after May 19, 2023, will not have in-house or contracted felony qualified counsel available … before July,” Kelley said in an email dated May 31, 2023. At the time, two dozen defendants in-custody would wait until July for counsel.

Yakima County’s backlogged court directly affected its defendants, many of whom could not afford a private attorney. 
“The heavy caseloads harm marginalized clients — often young, non-white individuals involved in gangs with traumatic personal histories — who need experienced attorneys to navigate their complex situations,” Vanessa Martin, a longtime public defender in Western Washington, said in an email to the state Supreme Court concerning a proposal to adopt new caseload standards.
Mixed models
The display on Mac Jardine’s computer at the Grays Harbor County Department of Public Defense is a photo of Noah’s Ark. When Jardine was hired to be the first director of the program, she was asked to “build” the department. 
“I had no direction, and they had no direction,” Jardine said. “It’s like sending me out to build an ark, and my name ain’t Noah … I have built my office from scratch.” 
Because administration of indigent defense services is decentralized in Washington, counties are operating with mixed models. Less than half of Washington counties have an office dedicated to public defense. The state Office of Public Defense encourages counties to create offices, but costs for space, public defenders, a director and other administrative positions are beyond the means of many rural counties.
King County employs all of its public defenders through the county. Grays Harbor County uses a mixed model of county and contracted public defenders. Asotin County in the state’s southeast corner relies solely on contracted attorneys to deliver public defense services.
In 2022, Kittitas County in Central Washington opened its own public defense department with its first employee, Eileen Murphy, now director of the program. On top of managing the county office, Murphy carries a full caseload. She works “at least 60 hours a week,” in an office with “a lot of walk-in traffic” and “phones ring[ing] all day.” She hopes in the future to hire more positions.
“That’s just the reality of the job for me,” Murphy said. “There are still some policies and procedures I’d like to put into place, but dealing with my clients and their cases is… my first priority.”
Murphy said this institutionalized model of public defense is better than relying on solely contracting attorneys because it holds people accountable.
“There are more protections in offices, because you have supervisors, and you have people that can review your work,” said Liz Mustin, supervising attorney of criminal defense programs at the Office of Public Defense. “Prosecutors are county employees who get county benefits and retirement plans, and the [contracted] defenders are just kind of on their own.”
Critics of contract attorneys say they aren’t as invested in their indigent defendants because they have other cases that might be more financially rewarding through a private firm. But for rural counties, models like this become the only way these services are possible. 
“I think relying on contract attorneys is a little scary because you just really have to rely on the attorneys’ integrity and intelligence and experience,” said Lisa Pruitt, co-author of “Legal Deserts and Spatial Injustice,” a study on indigent defense programs in rural Washington counties. “There’s a lot at stake for people if something goes wrong.”
Desperate for attorneys, some rural counties offer almost twice what urban counties pay contract attorneys. Asotin, Grays Harbor and Whitman counties offer $150 an hour for contract attorneys. King County, by contrast, offers $85 an hour.
A make-or-break decision
Now, the state’s system is at a crossroad.
Recent efforts to resolve Washington’s public defender shortage have stalled in the Legislature — except for Senate Bill 5780, passed in 2024, which created the law student rural defense program allowing law students to gain internship experience in rural jurisdictions. Though not a cure-all for rural counties, it helps, attorneys say.
Yakima County Department of Assigned Counsel described the program as “an overwhelming success” after two students who interned one summer returned the following year and expressed their intention to join the office after graduation, according to its grant application. 
This year, Senate Bill 5404, a bill that would have revolutionized Washington’s public defense by making the state pay for virtually all public defense programs, fell flat. Many are now anxiously awaiting the state’s Supreme Court to decide on new workload standards, which would dramatically reduce the caseloads for public defenders. Last year, the Washington State Bar Association adopted the standards and asked the Supreme Court to do the same. The Supreme Court has no deadline to act.

After a wave of resignations from public defenders last summer, criminal defendants were arraigned multiple times and waited months to be assigned a public defender.

If adopted, the new standards would set the maximum capacity for adult felony cases at 47 a year, less than a third of what it is today, but on a rolling basis over three years. 
Current standards, developed from a 1973 study, allow public defenders to take on up to 150 felony cases a year. But felony cases are more complex than they were 50 years ago and require the acumen of an experienced attorney. 
Public defenders say for a serious felony case, an attorney might sift through hours of body camera footage, order psychological evaluations, retain an investigator, create a defense strategy all while repeating the process for other clients and spending days in and out of court hearings. The stress adds up. People leave the field. Public defense administrators scramble to accommodate the constitutional right to counsel.
The state’s Office of Public Defense and King County have already adopted the standards, but counties are not required to abide by them until the Supreme Court affirms it.
“We know as a matter of fact that there is a crisis in public defense,” Matt Sanders, interim director of King County Department of Public Defense, said in the Supreme Court’s hearing on indigent defense standards. “The people who are harmed by this system are disproportionately people of color, the mentally unwell, LGBTQ members of our community. And we know if this court does not adopt these standards, that this ongoing crisis will continue unabated.”
The Washington State Bar Association asked for contractors to conduct a workload study last year and chose the same vendor who conducted a similar study in Oregon. The bar association says the study will conclude in late summer this year.  
There are many opponents, namely from rural counties, who say the standards would exacerbate the public defender shortage by mandating counties to hire more attorneys over a relatively short timeline without state funding. 
“The real problem is that the additional attorneys needed to bring the county in compliance with the amendments simply do not exist,” Albert Lin, prosecuting attorney for Okanogan County, said in a letter to the Supreme Court. “This is why I find the proposed amendments so perplexing — the solution to a supply problem is to create more demand?”
Over the last 20 years, three lawsuits in Washington have accused contracted public defenders of failing to provide adequate representation. Those lawsuits originated in rural counties that today feel like their concerns should prevent the Supreme Court from accepting proposed new standards that would significantly reduce public defenders caseloads and mandate new hires.
“To implement these standards as low as proposed will basically take away the very few attorneys that I have,” said Brooke Burns, Superior Court Judge for Asotin, Garfield and Columbia counties in Asotin County’s grant application. “Cases will have to be dismissed. This means that victims will not be made whole or felt to have secured justice. It will decrease community safety because defendants will have the knowledge that if there is no attorney, their crimes will go unpunished.”

That’s one of the recommendations made by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) in a feasibility report issued to Gov. Ron DeSantis, House Speaker Daniel Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton two weeks ago. The Legislature commissioned the study as part of an omnibus energy bill passed last year.
Other recommendations include:

Ensuring cost recovery for preliminary costs incurred during site evaluations to “mitigate financial risks” during the early phases of project development.
Commissioning a more comprehensive study beyond any benefit to Florida’s electricity needs, including its influence in attracting new economic development, manufacturing, workforce development, and a potential site inventory.
Moving forward with additional initiatives if the costs associated with advanced nuclear technologies are “more certain and demonstrate clear benefits to utility customers.”

The Legislature passed a law in 2006 that created an alternative cost-recovery mechanism for new nuclear construction. It was considered controversial at the time because it allowed investor-owned public utilities to collect money for nuclear projects that might never be built.
That’s what happened in 2013, when Duke Energy dropped plans to build two nuclear reactors in Levy County after billing customers for early stages of the project, citing federal licensing delays and economic concerns.
That resulted in a class action to recover money paid by customers of Duke and Florida Power & Light — a case in which the energy companies prevailed.
Four units
Florida has four nuclear generating units — two at Turkey Point in Miami-Dade County and two in a St. Lucie County plant, all operated by Florida Power & Light — which provide approximately 11% of Florida’s energy needs.
Approximately 75% of all energy in Florida comes from natural gas — a larger proportion from a single source than in any other state in the country, Florida officials said last year during a PSC workshop.
The report notes that the U.S. Department of Defense is looking at pilot projects to deploy small modular reactors (SMRs) at military bases around the country. SMRs are around one tenth the physical size of traditional large nuclear reactors.
The PSC report says that with Florida public utilities having experience owning and operating nuclear power plants, they may be well suited to work in partnership with the Defense Department at Florida’s many military installations.
“The DOD has the largest energy consumers globally, and its energy demands are only expected to increase as newer, high-energy-usage military systems are introduced,” reads a section of the report.
“The White House reported that the DOD consumes 10 million gallons of fuel per day and 30,000 GWh of electricity annually, nearly all of which is obtained through off-site and civilian shared electrical grids. Bases being over reliant on energy obtained through a civilian shared electrical grid is seen as a problem, especially if the base is faced with harsh weather, physical attacks, cyberattacks, or other emergencies. Past administrations have viewed nuclear power as a potential solution to ensure military base power grids remain operational and ready for critical missions.”
SMRs have reduced fuel requirements, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Power plants based on SMRs may require less frequent refuelling, every 3 to 7 years, in comparison to between 1 and 2 years for conventional plants. Some SMRs are designed to operate for up to 30 years without refuelling.
Litigation
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced last week that he was joining a group of states in filing a lawsuit against the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), accusing the agency of illegally blocking the development of advanced nuclear technologies like SMRs.
“For decades, Washington has made promises about nuclear energy — but then throws up roadblocks when real innovation comes along,” Uthmeier said in a written statement. “Florida is done waiting. We’re taking action to unleash the full potential of safe nuclear technology, strengthen our energy independence, and secure cleaner water and air in our state.”
The lawsuit was originally filed in Texas in December by a coalition that included the states of Texas and Utah and the advanced nuclear reactor company Last Energy Inc. They contend that the NRC licensing process, as outlined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, is only intended for reactors it deems “capable of making use of special nuclear material in such quantity as to be of significance to common defense and security, or in such a manner as to affect the health and safety of the public.”
The report notes that at least seven states have passed legislation in recent years regarding nuclear power, with several specifically making it easier to obtain permits for SMRs.
Following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 in Pennsylvania and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the old Soviet Union in 1986, construction of new nuclear power plants dropped dramatically in the United States. But with concerns about climate change growing, nuclear power has been looked at more favorably in some circles because it doesn’t produce greenhouse gas emissions.
In a draft environmental assessment for SMRs published in January by the NRC, the agency found that  building SMRs “would not have significant cumulative effects” on the surrounding environment, including on air quality, ground water, local ecology, animal habitats and aquatic resources. The assessment did add, however, that, “SMR operation could generate additional vapor plumes if the proposed SMR technology requires building additional cooling towers.”
Also, a 2021 paper from the Environmental Working Group said that SMRs would not alleviate the climate crisis.
A Pew Research Center survey conducted last May showed 56% of Americans favoring more nuclear power plants to generate electricity. Americans remain more likely to favor expanding solar power (78%) and wind power (72%) than nuclear power.
The survey reports that while support for solar and wind power has declined by double digits since 2020 — largely driven by drops in Republican support — the share who favor nuclear power has grown by 13 percentage points over that span.

(Courtesy of Commonwealth Media Services)Police have arrested a Harrisburg man in connection with what they call a “targeted attack” that caused a fire that heavily damaged the Pennsylvania governor’s residence early Sunday morning as Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside.
Pennsylvania State Police Col. Chris Paris identified the 38-year-old as Cody Balmer.
Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Sunday afternoon that his office was preparing to file charges against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded police after entering the residence grounds and setting the fire with “homemade incendiary devices.” He was arrested Sunday afternoon shortly before the scheduled 4:30 p.m. news conference, police said.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” Bivens said “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”

Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m. by a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders.
The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith.
The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said.
Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
 ‘Large and complex crime scene’

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI.
Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case.
While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said.
Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chain-link fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds.

State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said.
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

Now, 84% of counties have such programs, with expectations of reaching 100% by the end of 2025. (Getty Images)As the CEO of the Indiana Public Health Association (IPHA), I want to emphasize the importance of stable and flexible Health First Indiana (HFI) funding. HFI was established to strengthen public health services across all 92 counties, allowing local communities to address critical health issues such as infant and maternal mortality, smoking cessation, lead poisoning  prevention, and chronic disease management. Discussions of cutting funds or adding restrictions to spending raises significant concerns about the future of public health in Indiana. 
Historically, Indiana has ranked near the bottom nationally in key public health indicators. Before HFI, many counties lacked the resources to implement comprehensive, evidence-based programs to improve community health. In fact, according to State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver, only 39% of counties had programs focused on improving birth outcomes before these funds were made available. Now, 84% of counties have such programs, with expectations of reaching 100% by the end of 2025. This progress is at risk if funding restrictions are imposed, preventing local health departments from using resources where they are needed most. 
A fundamental strength of HFI is its local approach. Each county in Indiana has unique public health challenges, and a one-size-fits-all mandate on how funds are spent could severely limit the effectiveness of health interventions. A rural county may need to focus on expanding access to maternal care, while an urban area may prioritize addressing youth mental health and  substance use disorder prevention. The ability to tailor interventions to community-specific needs is key to achieving long-term improvements in health outcomes. 
Moreover, investing in public health has clear economic benefits. When communities are healthier, health care costs decrease, workforce productivity increases, and overall quality of life  improves. Chronic diseases, many of which are preventable with strong public health initiatives, are among the leading drivers of health care costs. Ensuring counties can invest in prevention  programs — whether that’s providing vaccinations, addressing food insecurity, or improving  access to mental health services —ultimately saves taxpayer dollars in the long run. The Indiana University Indianapolis Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health released a preliminary report exploring cost savings from just three core service areas—prenatal care, blood pressure  screenings, and fall prevention services — and estimate over $141 million in direct and indirect cost savings from the first year of HFI implementation alone.  
We encourage policymakers to continue supporting local decision-making and evidence-based programming. HFI was designed with built-in reporting and accountability measures to ensure transparency and effectiveness — you can learn how your county’s HFI funds are being spent online here. Rather than restricting how funds are used, let’s focus on expanding successful  initiatives and reinforcing local public health infrastructure.
The Indiana Public Health Association urges lawmakers to honor the significant impact HFI has already had in improving public health across the state. We must allow local public health officials to continue their work without unnecessary limitations that could hinder progress. Through stable and flexible funding, we can build healthier communities, reduce long-term  health care costs, and achieve greater health equity for all Hoosiers.

As designed, the 340B program requires participating manufacturers to sell discounted drugs to providers seeing low-income and underserved populations. Between 2005 and 2023, the program’s total drug purchases grew from $2.4 billion to $66.3 billion — with the explosive growth exposing a rift between the pharmaceutical companies supplying the discounts and the hospitals receiving them.
  Sen. Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso, rolls up paperwork while listening to colleagues speak about his bill on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
In response, state legislators are considering a bill to establish reporting requirements on qualified 340B entities, with a special focus on the dozens of hospitals accessing low-priced medications. 
“Transparency has been kind of a key word for everything we’ve done this session — for the last couple of sessions — and this is focusing a light,” said Sen. Ed Charbonneau, who authored the proposal. “What’s going on is legal, but it is far askance from the purpose of what the whole thing was — to provide low-cost medications to the indigent people needing help.” 
Senators opted not to concur with House amendments, sending Senate Bill 118 to a conference committee to finalize negotiations. But the latest version would require certain health providers under the program report: aggregate drug acquisition costs and payments, pharmacy dispensing payments, claims, how 340B savings were used, patient makeup and more. 
But for some of the small hospitals using the program, every dollar saved is vital to continue their services. 
“We don’t have the economies of scale that larger tertiary centers have. We have to make do with very little oftentimes,” said Brenda Reeta, the CEO of the Greene County General Hospital. “The cuts are getting deep enough now that it’s going to be bordering on … not just cutting service lines but, ‘Can we even stay open?’” 
 Criticisms of the program

In committee testimony, much of the program’s criticism can be summarized by William S. Smith, a senior fellow overseeing life science initiatives at the Pioneer Institute think tank in Boston. 
Smith presented roughly 15 slides before both Senate and House committees in January and March describing how hospitals, clinics and pharmacies can acquire medications at a “deep, deep” discount and then bill private insurers the full price — keeping the difference in a practice known as arbitrage. 
“Arbitrage drives this and that creates all sorts of bad incentives for the program because hospitals have every reason to bring in fully insured patients and not to treat uninsured patients,” Smith told senators in January. 
As evidence of this practice, Smith pointed to the opening of contract pharmacies affiliated with 340B entities in wealthy communities with high rates of private insurance. 
  The use of the 340B program has skyrocketed, as seen in this chart from KFF.
“Jeff Bezos could walk into a 340B pharmacy and get a 340B drug,” Smith said. “It should be targeted for low-income patients or uninsured patients, in my view.”
An Indiana one-pager from Pioneer concludes that more than half of these contract pharmacies are in affluent neighborhoods, dispensing drugs on behalf of 340B entities. Some of the state’s largest nonprofit hospitals use contract pharmacies based in California and Hawaii, a point of contention for Pioneer. 
Additionally, Smith criticized a decline in reported charity care. Lawmakers have amended the bill to exclude reporting requirements for 340 entities like Health Resources and Services Administration clinics. Programs under that umbrella include programs like the Damien Center’s services for Hoosiers with HIV or the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center.
Such clinics testified that they are already subject to stricter reporting requirements and auditing than hospitals. 
“I think clinics are different than hospitals. The clinics, generally, run things better. They’re audited on their charity care,” Smith said. “… and some hospitals are under-reimbursed by Medicaid and they really depend on 340B. That’s why I like (Senate Bill 118) because it doesn’t undercut the program. It just says, ‘What’s going on? How much money are you making?’”
Before House lawmakers in March, Smith doubled down, targeting larger hospital systems for additional scrutiny. 
“They’re cutting back on their charity care and … collecting tens of millions of dollars in revenue from 340B. I’d like to find out which hospitals are doing the right thing and which ones are not and a little transparency would help,” Smith said. 
Such concerns have reached Gov. Mike Braun as well, who issued an executive order in January ordering Health and Family Services Secretary Gloria Sachdev to examine the program and determine what oversight the state could pursue. Such a review is set to be finalized by the end of October. 
 Response from hospitals

Pushing back, hospitals said the savings from 340B weren’t ever meant to go directly to patients — something Smith also said. But rather, hospital administrator said, it offsets other programming. 
“If we focused on charity care, it suggests that our savings should be solely used to support charity care versus stretching scarce resources,” said Dawn Moore, a vice president and chief pharmacy officer with Community Health Network testifying on behalf of the Indiana Hospital Association. 
Moore additionally noted that charity care “only” considered services that were billed and then written off, leaving out free clinics, patient navigation services and more. 340B savings were generated when billing a private insurer, since the program can’t be applied to medications under Medicaid — hence why contract pharmacies may not be located in low-income areas. 
An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals

“We set up or provide services all throughout. However, because we generate a savings from locations where we have commercially insured patients, we take those savings and reinvest them where they’re needed,” Moore said.
Reetz, with the Greene County hospital, estimated that her hospital got roughly $500,000 in benefits from 340B but spent nearly half of that on self-auditing and administration. Though comparatively small, having that cushion allowed her system to keep its obstetrics and gynecology service lines open as well as cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. 
“We are one of the few rural communities that still has full OB services … It’s very costly to keep an OB department open and we have chosen to do that because, for us, it would be over an hour away for most of our community members to travel to deliver a baby,” said Reetz. “Within the last couple of weeks, we had a person come in that did not plan to deliver at our hospital but the baby was coming right now. 
“It was a complicated pregnancy and had she not been able to have an emergency (caesarean) section right then and there, the baby would have most definitely not made it. And most likely the mom too,” Reetz continued. 
Additional reporting requirements could eat into that money recouped from 340B, Reetz worried, on top of the other reporting and transparency requirements imposed on hospitals. Unlike other programs, no tax dollars are spent under the 340B program. 
“I don’t necessarily get why they’re trying to push for more transparency, because I believe it’s already as transparent as we can possibly be with it. It is just going to further dip into how much we actually are able to benefit from the program by making the administration of it even more costly,” Reetz said.

The Republican candidates for governor are largely opposed to abortion, though that hasn't stopped it from being a campaign issue. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Former radio show host Bill Spadea, a Republican who’s running for governor, raised eyebrows earlier this month when he told supporters during a campaign stop that abortion would not be an issue in the general election.
His campaign rivals swarmed, challenging his anti-abortion bona fides.
Spadea, though, told the New Jersey Monitor in a recent interview that he merely meant that abortion is a “distraction” Democrats likely will use to draw attention away from Jersey-specific issues that matter more to voters, like the high cost of living, crime, transportation woes, and immigration enforcement.
“I think the Democrats would love to make it an issue, because they think they can win by painting a false narrative that somehow pro-life candidates are anti-women,” Spadea said. “I do not think it’s going to be a top issue. And if the Democrats try to make it one, which I believe they will, especially if Mikie Sherrill is their nominee, it will serve as a distraction on the issues that New Jerseyans are really talking about.”
His GOP rivals, including former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, disagree.
“This is always going to be an issue because of the deep passion on both sides,” Bramnick said.
Kranjac saw Spadea’s comments about abortion as unacceptably dismissive for a candidate who landed endorsements from the national and state Right to Life groups.
“I will make it an issue every day,” Kranjac said. “It’s really important to change our culture of death and get New Jersey out of the abortion business.”
 The leading candidates for governor largely agree that New Jersey should have more restrictions on abortion. (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)
Republicans are hoping they can win the seat now held by Gov. Phil Murphy, a two-term Democrat who cannot seek a third term in November. But first they must make it through the June 10 primary to win their party’s nomination.
Bramnick proclaims himself pro-choice. When Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021, he said he would sign a bill protecting abortion rights if the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade (it did the following year). Both Bramnick and Ciattarelli say getting an abortion should be a decision that’s between a woman, her family, her doctors, and her faith.
All the leading GOP candidates oppose or have qualms with a law Murphy signed in 2022 to codify abortion rights in New Jersey, largely over an aversion to late-term abortions.
“I think they went farther than Roe v. Wade, and that’s why I abstained on that codification,” Bramnick said.
Ciattarelli would ban elective abortions after 20 weeks, while Bramnick said he opposes late-term abortions except in cases of medical emergencies. Kranjac said he would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exception during his first year in office, with the ban creeping earlier in pregnancy over time in line with his goal of “protecting life from conception to natural death.”
Spadea didn’t draw the line at any specific week, but said: “I am in line with mainstream America, which is: Late-term and up-to-birth abortion is abhorrent, and it will be very positive to see that limitation put in New Jersey.”
A 2022 Pew Research Center poll found that most Americans support abortion rights, but opposition grows at later stages of pregnancy.
All the leading GOP candidates for governor back requiring parental notification for minors who seek abortions, with Spadea supporting exceptions for rape and incest.
“The fact that a 16-year-old in New Jersey needs her parents’ permission to get her ears pierced, but not get an abortion is absurd,” Ciattarelli’s campaign website says.
Kranjac would appoint anti-abortion judges as part of his strategy on the issue.
Ciattarelli, Spadea, and Kranjac want to cut public funding for abortion, with Spadea and Kranjac saying they would cut funding for Planned Parenthood and send that support instead to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers, which the Murphy administration has labeled deceptive.
“As governor, I’m going to work very hard to empower pregnancy resource centers (for) young women, especially these young women who go to these centers that are from abusive relationships, don’t have any resources, they’re scared to death, they may be unsure of who exactly the father is, the dad’s left the scene,” Spadea said. “Just terrible circumstances for these young women, and they’re not given any choice.”

Last week, the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation added another 6,000 products to that list that should have been pulled in 2023 because they were all made with an ingredient produced by the company at the heart of the recall, Robertsville-based Delta Extraction.
The new “threats” were found after the division was ordered in February by the state’s administrative hearing commission to release any Midwest Magic brand products from its 2023 recall list. During that review, the division discovered additional marijuana products containing a THC oil that Delta Extraction made using “unregulated cannabis,” the division stated in a Thursday press release.
“Regarding risks to the public, the department recalled these products for the same reason it issued the original, related recall: It identified a potential threat to health and safety,” said Amy Moore, the divisions director, in an email to The Independent.

However, there have been no adverse reactions reported for any of the product in the original or updated recall, she said.

“The initial recall was a large and complex endeavor requiring expert application of system functionality and program processes,” she said. “The department has made improvements in both areas since that time and continues to improve in ways that ensure future recalls can better identify all relevant product at initial issuance.”
Delta Extraction is a licensed cannabis manufacturing facility that specializes in making THC distillate, a highly potent and pure form of THC used for things like vape pens, infused pre-rolled joints and edibles. About 100 other manufacturers bought the distillate in question in spring 2023 and went on to make thousands of products. 
In August 2023, the division suspended Delta Extraction’s license after finding the company’s distillate was made with untested “marijuana or converted hemp from outside of a Missouri licensed cultivation facility.” 
The state also issued the product recall.
Delta Extraction loses appeal of its revoked license following Missouri cannabis recall

A few months later, the state rolled back its recall of nearly 15,000 Midwest Magic products and allowed them to return to the dispensary shelves. Though part owner of the Delta facility, Midwest Magic owners successfully argued that the brand didn’t use the distillate in its products. 
A company called A Joint Operation owns the other 50% of Delta Extraction.
In February, Delta Extraction lost its appeal of its license suspension, but it was awarded a renewed search for Midwest Magic products on the recall list. The Thursday update released about 120 Midwest Magic products from dispensaries and manufacturing facilities. The update also allowed testing labs to release samples of several hundred recalled products so they can be destroyed.
Ted Maritz, co-owner of Midwest Magic, said the company had already written off the released items as a loss.
“I’m not going to ask any stores for payment or anything,” Maritz said. “Everyone’s gone through hell for this.”
While the ordered search had a small impact on Midwest Magic, it is having a big impact on some dispensaries and manufacturers carrying the 6,200 products. 
The recall list actually represents product tags used by the state’s tracing system called Metrc. Each tag in dispensaries typically represents a case of 10 to 12 units. And Metrc tags for manufacturing facilities represent ingredients that could make thousands or millions of units. 
One Kansas City manufacturer had almost 700 ingredients recalled Thursday. 
Josh Corson, co-owner of A Joint Operation, said he had not yet heard about the updated recall, in a text message Friday to The Independent and could not immediately comment.
Over the last two years, several companies have opted to destroy the products to make more room in their storage areas. 
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the division, said there was a slight increase for destruction requests since February through April, following the commission’s decision and totaling about 200 requests. However the division is “unable to identify whether these requests are specific to the February decision,” she said.  
The units remaining on hold for the Delta Extraction recall, which have not been destroyed, total nearly 157,000 items. That includes 4,000 THC concentrate items that equal 378,000 grams of oil, along with about 13,000 grams of marijuana flower. It also includes 18,000 infused edibles, more than 40,000 pre-rolled joints and 90,000 vape cartridges. 
In Delta’s appeal, the company argued the process it used to make the distillate was safe and legal. 
Delta Extraction admitted to importing a large amount of THC-A — a non-psychoactive compound of the cannabis plant that becomes intoxicating when heated — purportedly extracted from hemp plants. The company’s contractor would mix it with a smaller amount of THC-A extracted from Missouri-regulated marijuana. 
Delta argued the hemp-derived THC-A should fall under the same rules as added ingredients, like flavors or the non-intoxicating cannabis compound CBD, because hemp is not a federally controlled substance like marijuana. It was taken off the federal controlled substance list in the 2018 farm bill.
But Carole Iles of Missouri’s administrative hearing commission, wrote in her 137-page ruling that THC-A becomes intoxicating through the exact same process no matter if it’s extracted from hemp or marijuana, so the state is correct in regulating the THC the same as marijuana. 
That means it must be grown and manufactured in licensed Missouri facilities, Iles concluded, and tracked from the time the seed goes into the soil in the Metrc system.
“THC originating from other sources,” she wrote, “is prohibited.” 
Chuck Hatfield, former attorney for Delta Extraction, said licensed facilities have the ability to challenge these new recalls of the products on their shelves. 
“They probably should,” Hatfield said. “Because DCR has had such difficulty figuring out which products should be recalled, no licensee can be sure which products it can sell.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Greenhouse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 07:02:19.991224

Eric Schmitt speaks to reporters after the Governor's Ham Breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia in August 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt is confused about what his job is — or unwilling to do it.
Asked recently about the Trump Administration impounding $8.5 million of Title X funds granted to the Missouri Family Health Council to provide contraception, cancer screenings and STI testing at 52 clinics across the state, Schmitt sought to downplay the panic about Trump’s broader impounding of funds.
Schmitt said he gets asked questions about what Trump might do to us, but says “those things never happen. There’s an effort to sort of gin up outrage all the time.”
On the withholding of Title X funds specifically, Schmitt said he would be “happy to look at it more closely. I just think this idea that somehow everything’s in jeopardy, it’s just not true.”
“Now do Guatemalan sex changes need to go? Yeah, we don’t need to fund that,” he continued. “Do we need to fund DEI in Burma? No, we don’t need to do that. Do we need to fund DEI Sesame Street in Iraq? We don’t need to do that, that’s part of the problem, though, right? All of this stuff is just going out the door, nobody’s looked at it, it’s been really irresponsible.”
That’s a lot of dishonesty to unpack, but the bottom line is that everything is in fact in jeopardy and it’s Schmitt’s job to do something about it. 
Forgive my stating the obvious, but we have three branches of government and Schmitt is a member of the legislative branch. It’s his job to pass laws and allocate funding. The president doesn’t get to ignore the laws that Congress has passed. Yet Schmitt is trying to absolve Trump and Elon Musk’s illegal withholding of funding by playing dumb about the essential programs that Trump’s theft is wrecking. 
Congress enacted Title X over 50 years ago to fund necessary reproductive health care for low-income individuals. If Schmitt is genuinely unfamiliar with Title X, that is embarrassing for him and for Missouri. More likely, he is fully aware that increasing numbers of his constituents are scared or angry.
Schmitt is presumably repeating debunked claims about Sesame Street and “Guatemalan sex changes” to distract from the fact that life saving programs are being gutted. 
For example, funding for vaccine outreach is being withheld at a moment when we have a resurgence of measles, including in nearby states, that has killed children. The feds are withholding $255 million intended for public health programs in Missouri, and millions of our medical research dollars. 
But setting aside the relative merits of any particular program — if Congress funded it, Trump doesn’t get to just take it away.
Congressional Republicans, rather than demanding Trump execute the laws they have passed, have been lobbying Trump for relief for favored constituents, like farmers, from his impoundments and tariffs. 
Begging the king for favors is not how things are supposed to work in our constitutional system. 
It isn’t legal for Trump to rip up the budget because this is a representative democracy. The budget is the product of negotiations and compromises made by legislators representing the interests of people across the U.S. — not just the president’s favorite people.
A distaste for taking hard votes and saying hard things is a longstanding problem in Congress that has concentrated too much power in the executive branch. But this is an abdication of Congress’s duties like we’ve never seen before. 
Though our representatives have sometimes acknowledged the pain Trump is causing, they have done next to nothing to stop it. Trump’s tariffs (which are likely illegal because he is using emergency powers when there is no emergency) could be stopped by Congress. 
Instead, House Republicans, including all of Missouri’s, voted to amend House rules so that they cannot take a vote on removing the tariffs. They know their constituents are in trouble, but they are unwilling to do their jobs representing them if it means risking the wrath of Trump. 
In the Senate, four Republicans did vote to end the “national emergency” supposedly justifying Trump’s tariffs on Canada. Missouri’s senators were not among them.
Trump’s carnival of lawlessness has led to nearly 150 lawsuits seeking to remove tariffs or restore funding, but the courts will not be enough to save us. 
If clinics across the state close, kids go hungry, and people die of preventable diseases, our cowardly legislators will be as much to blame as Trump.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/081524_schmitt1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-14 07:02:19.991224

Months later, he ended the statewide measure. And he refused calls for a statewide mask mandate.
Instead, Idaho’s governor handed off most pandemic control measures to local governments. Some required masks and limited public gatherings at times.
This year — two years after the federal health emergency for COVID ended — the Republican supermajority-controlled Legislature stripped public health powers local governments did and didn’t use. Two new laws ban government mask mandates, along with medical mandates for vaccines, medical diseases diagnosis or treatment.
Those are among a handful of laws passed by the Idaho Legislature this year that will limit local governments’ policymaking powers.

The new laws deal with a range of issues — from banning more strict local child care regulations, limiting flags flown at government offices, and requiring big cities to regulate “public camping.”
It’s part of a longer trend of Idaho state lawmakers limiting local governments’ powers — like limiting raises to property taxes, and stopping localities from banning plastic bags or raising minimum wages.
“There is this ever present tug of war between ‘What is the proper role of local government?’ and ‘What is the proper role of the state government in telling the local government where their boundaries are?’” Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “And I think that that is going to continue forever.”

 Defining preemption: How states limit local decisionmaking

In the public policy world, moves by a higher level of government to limit the power of lower government are known as preemption.
In other words, it’s when a state blocks, or preempts, a local government from taking a certain action or pursuing a certain kind of policy.
Idaho Republican elected officials have long said they value local control and limited government. But they often carve out exceptions when they preempt local power.
“When you have Republicans saying that ‘It’s the government closest to the people that governs best,’ but yet they insert themselves as often as they do every year in the business of locals, I would say that they say one thing and then often do another,” Association of Idaho Cities Executive Director Kelley Packer told the Sun in an interview.
The Association of Idaho Cities says at least 14 Idaho bills this year sought to preempt local decisionmaking.
Sometimes, preemption is appropriate, said Packer, who used to be a Republican state lawmaker. She pointed to a bill this year that will block cities from requiring electric vehicle chargers in new developments.
“We as a city or any city should not be telling other elected officials or private developers that they have to put something in their development plans that doesn’t impact the health and safety of the city’s residents,” Packer said.
To Anthon, the top Idaho Senate Republican who has served in the Legislature for 10 years, deciding whether preemption is appropriate depends on the issue.
“A Republican would say ‘We absolutely support local control, so long as it doesn’t step on constitutional rights, the rule of law and … the constitutionally mandated powers of the state Legislature,’” said Anthon, a Republican from Rupert.
But to Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, Idaho’s pattern of preemption laws “exposes” the Republican value of local governance as “complete fraud.”
“They have no interest in local government. They want government that aligns with their ideologies,” said Rubel, a Boise Democrat who has served in the Legislature for 11 years.
She rattled off examples: blocking local governments from flying LGBTQ+ pride flags, preventing local governments from responding to climate change, and blocking federal grants meant to help child care.
Idaho’s Republican control makes the state an interesting case study for preemption, Boise State University political science professor Alexandra Artiles told the Sun.
“On the one hand, preemption can contradict ‘small government’ values or the idea that city councils, for instance, can better tailor policies to localized needs,” she wrote in an email. “On the other hand, Idaho is one of the few states without constitutional Home Rule, a legal framework that helps to protect local governments from state preemption.”

 What the Idaho Legislature did this year

Idaho’s new laws were among over a dozen bills state lawmakers considered this year to limit local decision-making.
Here’s a rundown of the new Idaho local preemption laws, signed by Gov. Brad Little:
Child care regulations
House Bill 243’s big policy shift is that it loosens Idaho’s state-set minimum child care staff-to-child ratios, effectively letting a staff member care for more children at a given time. That shift will make Idaho’s child-to-staff ratios the 45th loosest in the nation, up from 41st loosest in the nation, Idaho Voices for Children Executive Director Christine Tiddens previously told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
But on a local policy front, the bill also blocks local governments from having child care regulations that are more strict than what the state sets. 
The bill does that by repealing language in Idaho law that allowed for stricter local policy. The new law takes effect July 1.
Only nine cities license day cares, Packer said. That is largely in bigger cities — in response to emergency calls from parents whose kids got hurt, she said.
Mask mandates
House Bill 32 bans mask requirements for infectious disease by schools and Idaho government entities. The law took effect immediately after Little signed it into law in early March. 
Electrical vehicles
House Bill 86 preempts cities from requiring electrical vehicle charging stations or parking spots. The law took effect immediately after Little signed it into law on March 11.
Public camping
Senate Bill 1141 will ban public camping or sleeping in Idaho’s largest cities, essentially targeting people experiencing homelessness sleeping in public. The law allows the Idaho attorney general to civilly enforce the law against cities or county highway districts that knowingly violate the law. 
The bill takes effect July 1.
Flag restrictions
House Bill 96 restricts state and local government entities to only display official domestic government and military flags. Schools, colleges and universities are exempted from the flag bill’s restrictions.
While House lawmakers didn’t specifically mention it in the House’s floor debate, Boise City Hall has displayed the LGBTQ+ pride flag. The city continues to fly the flag, the Idaho Statesman reported Friday, despite the law already taking effect. 
Cars first, sidewalks and bike paths second
Two bills, Senate Bill 1140 and Senate Bill 1144, require highway districts to tailor new projects to cars — limiting new pedestrian or bicycle infrastructure, BoiseDev reported. 
Medical mandates
Senate Bill 1210 will create a broad medical mandate ban. It bars Idaho businesses, government entities, schools and colleges from restricting entry, employment or services based on requirements for medical interventions — like vaccines, medical diagnosis or treatment.
The law takes effect July 1.

 Idaho’s public health preemption leaves state less prepared for future pandemics, some say

Preemption is common in public health, Artiles, the Boise State professor, explains. In a previous research paper, she found governors issued over 1,200 preemptions related to COVID in less than the first two years of the pandemic.

But some officials worry Idaho’s public health preemptions this year leave the state less prepared to respond to future pandemics.
Most cities didn’t even require masks, and none of them required vaccines for entry to city halls, Packer said. (Public health districts in Idaho — essentially regional health authorities — did at times mandate masks and limit gatherings.) 
But the Association of Idaho Cities has pushed back on the mask mandate ban because, Packer said, “locals are the ones that have to answer immediately to any disaster that happens within the city or the county.”
“We don’t know what might come down the pike next — what we might be faced with,” Packer said.
COVID was unexpected, and left public officials to face tough choices. Some people wanted public health restrictions, and others wanted to be left alone, Packer said.

Rubel thinks the new laws leave Idaho less prepared to deal with a future pandemic. She remembers the days that thousands of Americans died each day from COVID. A future pandemic might be even worse, she said.
“I hope we never see another pandemic in our lifetimes. But chances are, we probably will — with population growth and all the factors being what they are,” Rubel said. “I don’t know what we can fall back on at this point. Everything has been dismantled.”
A health freedom philosophy influenced bills in the Legislature this year, Anthon said. That’s along with a sentiment that the government had too heavy a hand in responding to the COVID pandemic, he added.
“That was the sentiment of a majority of the members of the Legislature this year. … And a belief that when you have to make these medical or health care decisions, it’s better done on an individual basis. And that if you give people the proper information, they will make those decisions on an individual basis better,” Anthon said. “And that there still can be a government reaction to stop the crisis, if you’ll better inform people.”

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)A tip of the hat to Oklahoma’s state senators who managed to do some good governing that, for once, actually would help improve women’s health. 
These brave lawmakers voted to allow women to access six months’s worth of birth control at a time. That would make life infinitely easier for tens of thousands of Oklahomans who rely on contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancies or to treat other medical problems such as acne, irregular periods or endometriosis.
Any legislation aimed at safely blocking unplanned pregnancies should be an easy win for lawmakers who have all but banned abortions and who abhor the idea of women traveling out of state or taking medicine to end pregnancies. 
But apparently even the idea of easing women’s access to birth control was still a bridge too far for a 13-member bloc of Republicans who spent considerable time fearmongering and bashing their constituents who utilize safe sex practices.
In their minds, men and women who rely on extremely safe and common contraceptives are murderers because they’re preventing the fertilization of a human embryo. 
I’ve been called a lot of things in my life, but I think that’s the first time I’ve been accused of murder.
This is a good reminder that legislators should really think before they speak. KFF reported that last year, 82% of reproductive-aged women used a contraceptive. Oral birth control and condoms were the most common. 
At one time, I utilized oral contraceptives for family planning purposes. My doctor and I – not my elected representatives – determined daily medication was the best option for me. The oral birth control pills my doctor prescribed required that I take them at the same time each day for them to be effective.
At the end of each month, I would cringe because I had to make a special trip to the pharmacy to refill the prescription. Anybody who has ventured to a pharmacy knows it can be an arduous process.
There was a period of time when my insurance company allowed me to get a two-month supply at once, which was a small miracle. But at some point that benefit vanished.
That’s one reason I was so thrilled to hear that lawmakers were considering legislation that would enshrine that convenience into law threefold.
But rather than focusing on the good that it would do, some of our lawmakers focused on insulting not only women’s honor by accusing them of murder, but their intelligence.
They railed about how “very dangerous” contraceptives are.
Republican Sen. Dusty Deevers went so far as to insist that women on birth control have smaller-than-normal brains and increased rates of depression, anger and suicide. He also said birth control pills cause women’s sex drives to decrease, leading to less intercourse. And he warned of increased rates of blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, and cervical cancer.
Using contraception is a choice. And it should always remain an accessible choice — for both men and women who want to lower their chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection or becoming a parent.
Contraception is not for everyone. I respect the decision of women who choose not to use it for whatever reason just as I respect the decision of women who need access to it.
And yes, there are very low risks to using contraceptives – just like there are with any medication. But as it turns out, women face higher risks of blood clots and stroke while pregnant compared with being on birth control. I wonder why lawmakers conveniently forgot to mention that little nugget.
I took acetaminophen while writing this column because legislators’ arguments were making my small brain hurt. Out of curiosity I decided to read about the possible side effects of generic Tylenol. It turns out that it can cause bloody stool, produce sores on the lips, or make eyes or skin turn yellow.
And since men in the Oklahoma Legislature feel the need to focus on medication that primarily affects women, I decided to look into one for them. Complications of a popular men’s drug to treat erectile dysfunction include risks such as vision changes and hearing loss.
There’s a risk to everything in life. Some are greater than others. But that’s why medications are prescribed in consultation with our trusted physicians, and each medication comes with a disclaimer. 
Oftentimes the benefits outweigh the risks.
Most rational people understand that you can’t murder what doesn’t exist, and just because someone is engaged in sexual intercourse doesn’t mean they’re automatically going to fertilize an embryo. Just ask the families who are struggling to conceive. Experts place the odds of becoming pregnant at around 15% to 25% each month though things like age and sexual frequency could impact that.
Luckily, a bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Democrats saw through the charade, because there was a brief moment when I thought the Democrat-proposed bill would meet a terrible demise.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Now we must wait and see if our House legislators and governor can match that intestinal fortitude.
We women are watching.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.
Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in several states are pushing bills to prohibit unauthorized sales of hard-to-get restaurant reservations.
Proposed bills in California, Florida, Illinois and Louisiana take aim at online platforms such as Appointment Trader that allow diners to sell coveted reservations on the open market — sometimes without a restaurant’s knowledge.
In Louisiana, the issue gained attention surrounding February’s Super Bowl, when one customer paid more than $2,000 for a table at a top New Orleans restaurant, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Proponents of the platforms say these services provide customer flexibility and can boost restaurant business. But restaurant groups have opposed their entry into the market, arguing that they undermine the dining experience and can leave restaurants with empty tables.
The Illinois and Louisiana legislation follows New York state’s Restaurant Reservation Anti-Piracy Act, which went into effect in February. The law aims at curbing the “black market” in which reservations are scooped up as soon as they go live, Gothamist reported.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association asked state lawmakers to file a similar measure.
Wendy Waren, spokesperson for the association, told the Louisiana Illuminator that online platforms are selling reservations without restaurant’s permission or knowledge. If no one purchases reservations, tables can sit empty, preventing legitimate customers from getting a reservation, Waren said.
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
The Republican-sponsored bill, which would require platforms to have contracts with restaurants, is pending before the state House Commerce Committee.
A similar bill just won unanimous approval from the Illinois state House and now moves onto the state Senate for consideration.
The legislation would require a written agreement between restaurants and reservation platforms and would create a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation of the new law.
State Rep. Margaret Croke, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, characterized the move as a “commonsense” measure to protect restaurants and consumers alike.
“At a time when local restaurants are operating with extremely tight margins and working to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, they shouldn’t have to deal with third-party services snatching up their reservations and selling them at a premium, which leads to no-shows and confusion that only hurts their bottom lines,” Croke said in a statement.
The laws do not affect a restaurant’s ability to contract with reservation platforms such as OpenTable and Resy, which have applauded state crackdowns on other third-party sites.
Jonas Frey, who founded Appointment Trader, told the New York Times he launched the platform to help people get tables for a “fair market price.”
Last summer, he acknowledged that computer bots making reservations and then selling them were an issue, and said he had tried to prevent them from exploiting the website. But he said his website had only become popular because it was already difficult to get a reservation, especially in the New York City area.

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.
During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.



 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.
Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.



 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.
State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

This month, former Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon is making his fifth trip to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, and he feels it might be the most precarious.

The war, he said, has morphed from a battle at the front of artillery and tanks, into an exchange of cheap but dangerous drones and Russian “glide bombs” that can’t be detected by air defense systems.
“It’s a difficult place to go right now,” Brewer told the Examiner. “We want to see [Ukraine] win this war, and we want to do everything we can to boost their morale. I think they’re struggling right now.”
An additional goal of the latest trip, he said, is to make connections with agricultural officials in Ukraine. Nebraska, with its farm building and equipment sector, could play an important role in rebuilding the country, according to Brewer.
“If we don’t do anything until the war ends, we’ll lose that opportunity,” he said.
Don Hutchens, a retired head of the Nebraska Corn Board, is among those traveling to Ukraine this time. A Lincoln-based television reporter, John Grinvalds, is coming again to document the trip.
Brewer, an expert sniper who was wounded twice during six tours of duty in Afghanistan, used his previous trips to Ukraine to serve as an unofficial representative of the U.S. and as a military observer who relayed information gleaned from officials and soldiers at the front to the Nebraska delegation in Congress and the State Department.
The information included the effectiveness of American aid, ammunition and weapons and what else the Ukrainians might need to repel the invasion.
But this trip — a year after the last one — will be different because of the dramatic shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine after President Donald Trump took office. Trump suspended $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine, and, in a combative White House meeting last month, scolded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over his insistence that Russia could not be trusted.
Trump, later, stated that Zelenskyy was “not ready for peace.” Meanwhile, negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin have failed to result in a complete cease fire or peace deal.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump claimed that he could end the war in Ukraine before he took office or within 24 hours of becoming president. The Associated Press recently reported that Trump has admitted those boasts were a “little bit sarcastic,” though the president was also quoted that he was optimistic that he could broker an end to the war.
Brewer, in an interview Friday, said the contentious White House exchange between Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance was unfortunate.
“That’s something that needs to happen in a back room,” Brewer said of the heated debate before cameras.
That exchange, the senator said, helped boost Zelenskyy’s popularity ratings, but has put America in “a different light” across Europe and in Ukraine. During his past visits, Brewer said that when people saw the United States flag on his shoulder, they would come up and express thanks and provide hugs.
“You were always thought of in a pretty good light as an American…,” he said. “A good guy, who’s always going to be there.”
”We’re kind of in a precarious place right now. A lot of Europe is scratching their head and not seeing us as the same ally as they had before.”
Brewer said he hopes his latest visit will help assure the Ukrainians that “no one is abandoning them.”

“There’s a new president in the White House, and they have a little different look at this war,” he added. “It doesn’t change that what they’re doing is commendable.”
Despite the suspension of U.S. aid and armaments, Brewer believes that the Ukrainians are “winning” in some areas, inflicting heavy casualties, while bracing for an offensive from Russia later this month.
The war, he said, is now being fought with low-cost drones and glide bombs that avoid detection because they have no engines to produce a heat signature. Poisonous gases accompany some Russian missiles, Brewer said, and Ukraine has been forced to become more choosy when deploying expensive anti-missile systems.
While the Russian territory captured by Ukraine has largely been reclaimed by Putin’s army, it has come at a heavy cost of perhaps 50,000 Russian soldiers lost in the past month, according to Brewer.
“They’re losing as many people in a day as we lost in Afghanistan in 20 years,” Brewer said.
Help is coming from Europe, he said. F-16 fighter jets recently arrived from The Netherlands, as have gas masks from Britain, Brewer said. Germany has been asked to provide missiles to replace the American Tomahawks.
If those are provided, it could be a “game changer,” he said.
Can there be peace? Brewer said he doesn’t see it soon, given that Russia is gearing up for a huge offensive push.
But by this fall, if Ukraine can hang on, he said that most observers believe that Russia will have exhausted its military assets, and leaders will be ready to strike a peace deal.
Brewer said he doesn’t see any quit in the Ukrainian soldiers he’s met at the front, some of whom are 50 years old or older.
“It’s all because they grew up in communism, and they know the consequences of giving up,” he said. “They’d rather die than see their kids and grandkids grow up in that system.”

(Photo courtesy of Richard Schaefer)It was a day like any other when Richard Schaefer entered a Madison health care clinic to receive harm reduction supplies. Over 10 years, Schaefer had tried recovering from what began with dependence on a prescription for the pain killer Percocet and later spiraled into an all-consuming heroin addiction. As Schaefer waited for his supplies, he noticed an advertisement seeking volunteers for a study into whether therapy assisted by psilocybin – the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms – could unshackle people from addiction. 
“I’ve tried all types of rehabs,” said Schaefer when he spoke recently with the Wisconsin Examiner. Schaefer is 42, off heroin and training to be a peer support specialist. But from rehab clinics in Oshkosh and Wauwatosa to a 30-day program in the Racine County Jail, old-school complete abstinence and medication-assisted treatment using suboxone, Schaefer had tried it all. “I don’t know if it was more of the timing of being ready to quit or just finding something that actually works for me,” he said. “Something different, an alternative route…This study really changed my life, to tell you the truth.”

Although overdose deaths are down in every state and the District of Columbia for the first time since the fentanyl crisis began, millions of people continue to struggle with opioid use disorder nationwide. With demand for treatment still high, the University of Wisconsin Transdisciplinary Center for Research in Psychoactive Substances (TCRPS) is working on finding solutions. Using psilocybin, the team at UW-Madison is developing groundbreaking new therapies tailor-made for people like Schaefer. Advertisements for the study, which focuses on opioid and methamphetamine addiction, can be found in Madison health care clinics like the one Schaefer visited and even on signs on city buses.  
“We already have seen evidence that psilocybin can do some remarkable things to improve the patients’ ability to gain and process important insights about their lives and experiences,” Paul Hutson, a professor and founding director of TCRPS, told UW News in 2023. “We’re excited to see what it can do along those same lines for patients struggling with substance abuse, many of whom have overlapping mental health conditions.” 
A bipartisan bill that began circulating last session in the Wisconsin Legislature aimed to make psychedelic drug treatment available to veterans suffering from PTSD. Commenting on a psilocybin study at UW-Madison that aims to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in combat veterans, UW researcher and professor Dr. Cody Wenthur told Wisconsin Examiner that conducting trials with an inclusive cross-section of subjects is important. 
Although funding cuts by the Trump Administration have undermined research efforts across the country, UW’s psilocybin study is not at risk, university officials say. A university spokesperson said that the study’s funding does not come from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and thus is “insulated” from cuts to NIH funding. 
Research has shown that psilocybin has the potential to rewire the human brain, for people with depression. The creation of new neuro-pathways aided by psilocybin, combined with therapy, could help treat substance use disorder, which also changes the brain over time to reinforce addictive behavior.
Nationwide millions of people struggle with an opioid use disorder of some kind. Wisconsin alone annually loses thousands of lives to drug overdoses, with a large portion of those deaths linked with variants of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. By 2038, Wisconsin is expected to receive over $780 million in settlement funding from lawsuits against the companies that seeded the overdose crisis by funneling large volumes of addictive medications into communities. That funding could be used to repair the lives of people and the health of their communities.

Before he started taking Percoset, Schaefer was a college-educated operations manager at a furniture company, who’d grown up in Racine County. A husband, father and homeowner, he was climbing the ladder in his company when he was prescribed the pain killers. “Everything just kind of quickly fell apart,” said Schaefer, “within about six months to a year I lost all that.” 
During those six months his use of the medication became a recreational habit, then developed into a heroin addiction. Once needles came into the picture, “then it’s just no going back,” Schaefer said. “I ended up going down the drain. I lost my marriage, I lost custody of my kids on an overdose, and then I lost my job — my career I was at for 10 years. And then I lost my house to a foreclosure.” The degradation of his life was swift. He recalled  being kicked out of two sober houses. Eventually, he said, “I ended up on the streets.”
The doors of perception 
Schaefer was immediately intrigued when he saw an advertisement for the psilocybin study. He was already on a suboxone regimen in December 2023, which he said helped him get “on the other side of the wall” from his addiction. He entered the study the following month after contacting the research team. Numerous physical health assessments, phone calls, interviews and meetings followed. 
Schaefer was connected with “two really great therapists,” Travis Fox, a doctor in psychology and Nikki Zellner, a licensed clinical social worker. Their compassion and patience formed the bedrock for his recovery. He had to meet them once a week for a month, in addition to meeting other requirements. 










When you look at it as medicine rather than a drug, then we can have a different view on it.


– Richard Schaefer


“They really got to know me and really bring out, or work on, issues that I had suppressed in my life, going back to childhood.” Schaefer said. Fox and Zellner “helped me to learn to love myself again,” he added. It was an alternative approach to therapy that Schaefer hadn’t seen in other recovery programs. “They accepted me for who I am, and helped me to learn that it’s OK to be myself,” he said. “To find the freedom of making a choice, it wasn’t all about abstinence, which a lot of programs are.” Schaefer said that “somehow, with making it my choice, I’ve become a new person and really found a new freedom with that, and really blossomed and come a long ways.” 
By April, Schaefer was ready to step into the experience of psilocybin-based therapy. Early in the morning he caught a cab to the UW nursing school. After one final physical check-up and conversation with doctors, Schaefer was led to a space which he called “the sacred room there.” In that comfortable room surrounded by artwork and with a couch and spaces for Schaefer and the therapists to sit, Schaefer took “the medicine” and his journey began. 
“They didn’t tell me what to call it,” said Schaefer, speaking of the psilocybin he took. “When you look at it as medicine rather than a drug, then we can have a different view on it.”
Taking his shoes off as he entered the room, Schaefer lay back on the couch, took a tablet, donned a blindfold and waited as about 20 minutes passed. 
“I remember the first session for me was kind of like a movie,” he said. “Like different scenes kept coming to me, you know? Different waves kept coming to me. And some of it was different scenes from life, some of it made sense, or some of it I’m still trying to make sense of what they were. But I realized a lot of things in that first session alone.”
“I think I was learning to find myself,” he said of the experience. A persistent sense of comfort, peace and acceptance stayed with Schaefer after that first session. His ego had been muted, “and I just had this new sense that things were OK,” he said. “I began to have a new outlook on life then.”

Sometimes participants in the psilocybin trials need a bathroom break or to pull out and communicate about what is happening. Zellner and Fox were never far away, and were open to talking to him while he was undergoing the journey. “It’s hard to put words on things while you’re having the medicine in you,” said Schaefer. “I go into it and would like to tell them all these things going on, and to be recorded, and jot down and stuff, but it’s like you can’t find the words to say it.”
“You’re kind of in another world,” he added, saying there may not actually be human language to describe some of the experience. The second dose was even more profound. The “scenes” returned with astonishing vividness. Schaefer recalled going through stages of what felt like collective “human sadness” as well as happiness and joy. 
“There was like a buildup from down and dark to the absolute most bright light and loving energy that I’d ever experienced,” he said. It was in that peak moment “when I felt that I was in the presence of a higher power,” which manifested as a sort of “god” or “energy that was in front of me.” He said he felt a distinctly separate, intelligent presence throughout his sessions, “like things were being taught to me and shown to me.” 
Whatever it was, the presence gave him “the most awesome comforting feeling I’ve ever felt in my life,” Schaefer recalled. The feeling melted away as Schaefer descended from that blissful state. 
Integration 
In many ways, the hard work begins after the psychedelic experience ends. With the help of their therapists, study participants must attempt to integrate and process what they learned during the sessions. “The integration was powerful because of the therapists being there, to immediately process things coming to your mind,” said Schaefer. 
After each session, Schaefer was walked back to the hospital where he was given some alone time for the night. He never interacted with any other study participants. The next morning, Schaefer met with Fox and Zellner again for a clearer, deeper dive into the prior day’s session. Another follow up came about a week later. “And again, man, that has been such a life-changing experience having a psychedelic medicine with therapists,” Schaefer said, emphasizing that without proper integration and therapy after psychedelic experiences, “you’re lost.” 
Today, Schaefer is clean from heroin and opioids and living a healthier life. Undergoing the psilocybin study at UW-Madison has inspired him to pursue a career as a certified peer support specialist, for which he’s currently finishing training. He aims to become an advocate for harm reduction medications and alternative psychedelic therapies for addiction recovery.
“I would say it’s not for everybody, but for some people who’ve tried different approaches and it hasn’t worked, and they’re serious about changing their life and having an open mind, then this could really be a profound experience to help them go in a new direction,” said Schaefer. 
He hopes that both treatment providers and people struggling with addiction remember that recovery takes patience, compassion, and that it doesn’t have to rely on an abstinence-only philosophy. “It might take 20 times … trying different approaches,” he said. 
Yet in Wisconsin, alternative options are not widely available. States like Colorado are already working to expand psychedelic-based treatment centers, as well as to legalize and decriminalize psilocybin. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Legislature remains reluctant to explore bills to even legalize medicinal cannabis. Schaefer hopes that more people struggling with opioid addiction get the chance that he did. “I’d say it’s already changed my life in so many ways.”

What a total surprise since a few months earlier, those same groups had been awarded grant money for their projects emphasizing topics about Idaho’s unique history and showcasing Idaho’s role in America’s 250th year anniversary. Bewilderment added to the disappointment.
Idaho council cancels grants for America250 selectees who were already told they’d receive funds

Last Dec. 16, 2024, the Twin Falls County Historic Preservation Commission received the following message: “We are pleased to inform you that Twin Falls County Historic Preservation Commission’s A250ID grant application has been selected for award. Thank you for your thoughtful and complete application to commemorate this milestone for our nation and state. We applaud your organization’s service to your community. Congratulations!… We are grateful for your partnership in advancing the ideals of the American Revolution – equality, liberty, and justice – through meaningful community engagement and recognizing, appreciating, and commemorating Idaho’s journey in America’s legacy
The historic preservation commission had applied for and was awarded $25,000 America250 in Idaho grant, only to have the grant program abruptly cancelled by the Legislature. The 31 applicants, having been awarded grants, and being completely unaware of the Legislature’s new terms and conditions, should be entitled to receive the funds promised under the original rules that encouraged the 31 organizations to apply in the first place.
On March 24, 2025, the historic preservation commission is then informed by the Idaho State Legislature that “After careful consideration of legislative intent, the grant program through America250 is cancelled.”  No details or reasoning are provided for the cancellation.  The March 24 cancellation letter goes on to proclaim love for Idaho and its history, stating that “We appreciate your organization’s role in preserving and sharing Idaho’s story …”
The historic preservation commission volunteers have dedicated over seven years and hundreds of hours of donated time, with the support and encouragement of SHPO, Twin Falls County commissioners, Idaho Heritage Trust, and Preservation Twin Falls in an effort to establish a National Register Historic Mining District preserving a series of Chinese placer gold mining sites dating to ca. 1870-1881 and ca.1933-40 Depression-era located in the Snake River Canyon between the Perrine and Hansen bridges. 
Our initially accepted project application seemed to perfectly correlate with House Concurrent Resolution 31’s stated criteria: “Idaho, known as the ‘Gem State,’ occupies a unique place in the mosaic of American history, with significant historical milestones, eras, innovations, and advancements …”  
The 1870s, when the United States was commemorating the Revolution’s centennial, was a dynamic time when southern Idaho was fundamentally changed by the California gold rush, the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, and the new Transpacific trade and immigration networks extending from Guangdong (Canton) and Hong Kong to San Francisco and the Snake River Canyon.
One of our strengths as a community and a state has been the investment in cultural and historical preservation.  The America250 in Idaho grant projects would have paid huge, long-term dividends in preserving and promoting Idaho’s historic legacy and public education. 
Volunteer organizations such as the Twin Falls County Historic Preservation Commission, Lincoln County Historical Society, and the Boise Contemporary Theater rely heavily on grants such as America250 in Idaho to preserve and share Idaho’s story.  
The abrupt cancellation of these projects has implications extending far beyond the balance sheets; they threaten the very fabric of the communities they serve. 
The historic preservation commission’s goals align with the stated criteria in HCR 31 to “encourage Idahoans to reflect on American and state history and heritage, develop deeper connections within their communities, and advance Idaho’s contributions and values for the benefit of our children and future generations.”  
The historic preservation commission’s volunteer commissioners are committed to following through with the National Register nomination for the Snake River Canyon Historic Mining District, and it is our hope we can continue to count on the Idaho Legislature’s support for grass-roots, community-based historic preservation projects.

In a rarely filed and sometimes sharply worded “motion for rehearing,” state prosecutors maintain that the Appeals Court erred in granting a dismissal last month of the theft by deception charge faced by former director Trevor Jones.

The 21-page request, signed by acting Solicitor General Zachary Viglianco, argues that was wrong to dismiss the felony charge without hearing arguments by the AG’s office, and that the dismissal was premature by not giving the AG’s office 10 days to contest it.
The court granted a “summary dismissal” of the charge faced by Jones, thus discharging the prosecution without hearing arguments from the AG’s office.
“Inexplicably,” the AG’s request states, “the court granted Jones’ motion two days before the state’s response deadline had run. That was error. And one with profound consequences.”
“The court’s premature ruling,” the motion continues, “signals to litigants that they cannot rely on the straightforward adherence to and application of the court’s own rules.”
Jones’ lawyer disagrees
On Thursday, a lawyer representing Jones, Michael Wilson of Omaha, asked the Appeals Court to uphold the dismissal, arguing the the AG’s office relied on the wrong court precedents in seeking to revive its prosecution.
The response and the request for rehearing, filed April 3, are the latest twists in the prosecution of Jones. He is accused of misdirecting $270,000 in donations from a private foundation into another foundation he controlled, rather than using the money, as intended, to cover agency financial losses from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Jones resigned the $164,800-a-year director’s job in 2022, shortly before a State Auditor’s report raised questions about the legality of the funds diversion.
In January, Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong tossed out the felony charge faced by Jones, ruling that state prosecutors had failed to bring him to trial within the state’s speedy trial deadline.
Then, last month, Nebraska Court of Appeals Judge Frankie Moore granted a dismissal of the state’s appeal, ruling that state prosecutors had failed to follow proper procedure in appealing the lower court’s dismissal.
State prosecutors, via the motion for rehearing, are now asking the Appeals Court to reconsider and to let them revive the case against Jones.
The AG’s office, in its recent motion, argued that dismissing the case — which it called “a high-profile criminal case involving a public official” — on technical grounds without allowing the state to present any argument undercuts the “the fair administration of justice” and the opportunity to hear “two sides to every story.”
No action yet
The Appeals Court had not issued a response to the state’s rehearing motion as of late this week.
When the case was dismissed last month, Jones’ lead attorney Mallory Hughes of Omaha, told the Examiner that she had been “very confident” that the Court of Appeals would dismiss the case and was equally confident that further appeals would not be successful.

Jones, 52, had headed the agency he renamed “History Nebraska” for six years before his resignation. Gov. Jim Pillen has since revived the agency’s long-time name, the Nebraska State Historical Society and installed as director a former Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard, Daryl Bohac.
Eric Hamilton, who had served as Solicitor General for the AG’s office since 2023, recently left that post to take a job with the U.S. Department of Justice in the Trump Administration.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fourth-generation Middle Tennessee cattle farmer Cole Liggett lined up with scientists and environmental advocates in March to urge Tennessee lawmakers not to gut the state’s historically strong protections for wetlands.
Wetlands protection has been good business for Liggett. In addition to raising cattle, he’s a manager at Headwaters Reserve, a firm that developers pay to preserve and restore wetlands and streams so they can destroy them elsewhere, called mitigation banking. If lawmakers follow through on a plan to deregulate an estimated 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands, that will upend the industry in Tennessee and drive up prices for developers still required to pay for mitigation, Liggett testified.
Liggett works in a growing industry that operates more than 2,500 mitigation banks nationwide, earning an estimated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019, according to a 2023 study funded by the Ecological Restoration Business Association. 
The industry is built on demand spurred by the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, which requires developers to offset their damage to wetlands by building or restoring wetlands nearby.
But recent federal actions to shrink the scope of that law are pushing states to choose how strictly they will regulate wetlands. The consequences of those decisions not only threaten further degradation of land, water and wildlife, but also the fortunes of an industry that has made a big business out of conservation.
Environmentalists: Second attempt at wetlands bill would leave 80% vulnerable to development

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from wetlands that don’t have a surface connection to navigable waters, which means bigger rivers and lakes. President Donald Trump’s Administration has vowed to ease regulation, allowing developers to ditch and drain all but the wettest wetlands without permits or mitigation. Environmentalists fear that a recent order to speed up around 600 energy projects nationwide could limit requirements to compensate for the destruction of wetlands.
Some states, such as North Carolina and Indiana, have loosened regulations since the Sackett decision. In March, Kentucky lawmakers passed legislation to do the same, overriding Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
Tennessee’s wetlands regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act protections passed in the 1970s, but pending legislation could roll back much of that protection, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Tennessee Ecological Restoration Association, which represents Liggett and other mitigation bankers in Tennessee and the southeast, told the Tennessee Lookout that this will directly impact the growing mitigation industry. “We will see a decrease in demand for credits if aquatic resources are deregulated.”
Those concerns aren’t shared by everyone in mitigation banking. The national industry is more worried about the defunding of agencies that oversee banks and the prospect of a recession.
William Coleman’s California-based ecological consulting firm Eco-Asset Solutions and Innovations does much of its business in states that have active wetlands mitigation banking programs.
“My company has not seen any downturn in business,” Coleman, the firm’s founder and president, said. ‘Landowners are still very interested in the revenue opportunities mitigation banking offers.”

States limiting wetlands protections could risk long-term industry investments
Just outside of Memphis, a chorus of frogs on a roughly 250-acre tract of former farmland nearly drowns out the traffic on nearby Austin Peay Highway. Environmental consulting firm EnSafe planted about 54,000 trees on the once flood-prone fields in 2018 and will be responsible for its upkeep until the wetland is mature and healthy – anywhere from seven to 10 years. After that, the land will go to a partnering land trust, where it will be conserved in perpetuity.
“Granted, there is a business piece to what we do, but restoring things to the way they were is also pretty cool … There will be a pocket here forever,” EnSafe principal Paul Stoddard said.
The West Tennessee Wetlands Mitigation Bank has sold credits to Amazon to offset a new delivery center in Fayette County. A contractor purchased credits to compensate for a 2-million-square-foot distribution facility called “Project Iron Giant,” according to records kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the federal agencies tasked with overseeing wetlands regulations.
TERA estimates that mitigation businesses have poured more than $1 billion into around 130 mitigation bank investments across Tennessee.
“The beauty of mitigation credits is that the developer just writes a check and they’re done. All the monitoring and reporting and maintenance and stuff is up to the bank,” EnSafe Senior Ecologist Jimmy Groton said.
That process makes mitigation banking a high-risk industry, according to Liggett. Regardless of whether they sell credits, banks are required to maintain their wetlands for at least seven years. The proposed regulatory rollback on Tennessee’s wetlands would mean an 80% decrease in demand for mitigation businesses, he testified to Tennessee lawmakers on March 26.
“Such a drastic decrease in the demand after such a high investment … has potential to drive up credit prices as a necessity to avoid potential financial insolvencies,” Liggett said.
Hillary Bonham, a principal at environmental consulting firm Baetis Restoration Partners, has experience as both a residential developer and mitigation banker. She told Tennessee lawmakers that the current average price of a credit in Tennessee is around $50,000. Reducing regulations and hampering demand will likely cause the credits that remain to be “exponentially more expensive when they are needed.”
In Georgia, where isolated wetlands are not regulated, a single credit can range from $750,000 to $1.1 million according to the Georgia Alabama Land Trust In Lieu Fee Program, Bonham said.
 States can further protect isolated wetlands that no longer count as Waters of the U.S.

Mitigation banks have been the preferred way to offset wetland destruction for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps since 2008, and the industry has ballooned rapidly since the first entrepreneurial banks were established in the early 1990s.
John Paul Woodley, Jr. helped issue the Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 mitigation rule while serving as assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. He’s also the immediate past chair of the board of the National Environmental Banking Association, a trade association with around 100 members nationwide.
Some people expected to see the Sackett decision have a dramatic impact on mitigation banking, he said, but two limiting factors prevented a panic within the industry.










For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.

First, when the decision was made, developers already well into the permit process could either choose to move forward under the previous terms or go back to the drawing board. Most businesses didn’t want to start over, so many pending permits under review by the Corps proceeded as though nothing had happened, Woodley said.
Second, states have significant control over the regulation of state waters.
“Many states have just said, ‘We don’t care about that. We have our own jurisdiction, and we’re not limited by what the Clean Water Act says is the waters of the United States … If the U.S. doesn’t want to protect those waters, that’s fine and dandy. We will,’” Woodley said.
Some states have more isolated wetlands than others, he added, and those states will have to decide whether to protect those resources. Woodley thinks they ultimately will.
Generally, coastal wetlands will maintain federal protection because of their connection to the navigable waters of the ocean. But experts fear that some swamps and marshlands, once protected, may now face development due to human-made flood-control structures, such as levees or berms, that could be construed as legal separations between wetlands and waters of the U.S.
How President Trump’s push to expedite wetlands permitting process could backfire
President Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” led the Corps to fast-track review for more than 600 permits. 
Environmental advocates say that could come at the expense of wetlands. 
“Any damages to wetlands due to this emergency must be mitigated properly,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit advocating for communities along the Gulf Coast. “For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.”
Those in the industry see other actions by the administration as slowing down environmental permitting, posing a different kind of threat. Trump’s first administration made funding cuts to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps that ultimately increased the time it took to review pending permits. Longer review periods can mean less return on investment for landowners, Coleman said.
“That meant there were just not enough bodies to review the applications that were on the table … so there was a tremendous delay,” he said. 
Coleman’s company found that an average two- to three-year review period stretched into four or five years during Trump’s first term. 










We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks.


– Kristen Schlemmer, Bayou City Waterkeeper


Woodley said demand for mitigation banks is driven largely by development pressure. In Virginia, where he’s based, data centers are a big contributor. Some of the mitigation banking industry’s biggest customers are state transportation departments and the oil and gas industry—roadways and pipelines often have less flexibility to build elsewhere.
“Anything that takes place that causes an economic downturn, that causes people to retrench and postpone their development plans … that’s the risk to the mitigation industry,” Woodley said. “They had a very difficult time around 2008 … the number of permits applied for declined, and at the same time, the number of the requirements for mitigation took a downturn.”
In Gulf States like Louisiana, which is home to 40% of wetlands in the continental U.S. and has sustained 80% of national wetland losses, environmental advocates warn about the consequences of filling in wetlands through emergency permitting without ensuring proper mitigation. 
“We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks,” said Kristen Schlemmer, senior legal director of the Bayou City Waterkeeper, a nonprofit working to protect communities impacted by water pollution and flooding in Houston.
Some wetlands mitigation banking businesses have begun to diversify their offerings to include conservation-based credits for protecting the habitats of endangered species, carbon sequestration or nutrient banking to prevent excessive runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus.

The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.


During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities. 










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
Private detention oversight
Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
Troubling conditions
Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.


State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.

For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.











We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith



Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

In 2023, Michigan Democrats passed a number of clean energy laws, including requiring energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040, and granting the state’s energy regulator the authority to approve permits for large-scale renewable energy and battery storage projects, which was previously exclusive to local governments.
Under the law, which took effect on Nov. 29, 2024, developers are required to work with municipalities whose permitting process mirrors the new requirements, giving the two parties 120 days to reach an agreement. The parties can also apply for a 120 day extension. 
However, if the municipality fails to approve or deny the application within a timely manner, if the local zoning board adopts standards stricter than the health and safety standards outlined in the law, or if the local zoning board denies an application that complies with the standards outlined in the law, the developer can submit a permitting application to the Michigan Public Service Commission, or MPSC, which regulates Michigan’s energy utilities. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the complaint, Otsego County failed to adopt a renewable energy ordinance that complies with the requirements of the state law. Additionally, the plaintiffs argue that because the exceptions for submitting an application to MPSC do not apply, RWE Solar Development LLC, the developer for the project, cannot move forward with construction of its “45th Parallel Solar” project until any challenges to the permit are resolved. 
Earlier this year, the project faced backlash from 50 Republican House Representatives and Democratic State Rep. Karen Whitsett of Detroit, over an effort to lease more than 420 acres of state-managed land for the project from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. 
However, Patricia Kakridas, senior manager for media and public relations for RWE Clean Energy, told the Michigan Advance in January that the project would be developed on land leased from two private landowners and does not include state land in its footprint. 
Kakridas also indicated the decision not to lease state land was not a recent determination, telling the Advance “We did not just make that determination. We started working with two private landowners in 2019 and during the development process, we conducted outreach to all landowners adjacent to the project location, including DNR. Ultimately, we decided to move forward with leasing property from the two private landowners for this particular project.”
Advocates rally for clean energy as lawmakers continue to tweak legislation

David Delaney, who represents the plaintiffs challenging the project, told the Michigan Advance that the plaintiffs include individuals whose property adjoin the site for the solar development, alongside residents living nearby and residents of Otsego County who expect the county to comply with the law. He expects many other residents will join the case.
Alongside challenging the permit for the project, the complaint also raises concerns with the state law, arguing its standards for “dark sky-friendly lighting solutions” and “dark sky-friendly lighting technology” are unconstitutionally broad. It also asks the court to declare the energy zoning law’s ban on localities adopting zoning standards that are stricter than those outlined within the legislation, an “invalid exercise of state legislative authority.”
Additionally the complaint argues the zoning law violates both the U.S. Constitution and the Michigan state constitution, pointing to an Oct. 10 order from the Michigan Public Service Commissions which the plaintiffs say redefines terms and procedures within the state law. 
“[The law] confers broad sweeping authority to the MPSC. [It] provides no standards to channel the scope of the MPSC’s broad authority. [It] provides the MPSC with indefinite powers,” the complaint reads, asking the court to declare both the law and the MPSC’s order unconstitutional. 
“The Michigan Public Service Commission is in the executive branch under the governor, and so in their order from 2024 they started to rewrite the Act 233 legislation. And that certainly isn’t their bailiwick, that’s what the House and Senate do. They write the law,” Delaney said. 
“So [the MPSC] made an adjustment there to say, ‘You know what, if you didn’t adopt a CREO — that’s the compatible renewable energy ordinance — it’s okay. You can have your own zoning ordinance, or you can draft a new one, or use the one that you already have in place.’ The problem with that is, is that the state law doesn’t provide for that,” Delaney said.
While nearly 80 municipalities have already filed a suit with the Michigan Court of Appeals challenging the MPSC’s order, Delaney said his client’s concern is that it does not address the state law. 
 “If the Court of Appeals sided with the counties and the townships, the MPSC would just draft another order and another order and another order. So you’re kind of going around the tree, if you will, when you’re not getting to the heart of the issue,” Delaney said. 
In an email, Kakridas told the Advance that RWE does not comment on ongoing litigation.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Revised textbooks on the five Native American tribes that share land with North Dakota will be ready in time for next school year.
For about three decades, the books went without updates due to a lack of funding, said Lucy Fredericks, director of Indian and multicultural education for the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction.
In 2023, the agency began work on editing the books with the help of federal grant money.
The revision process was a joint effort among the Department of Public Instruction, the five tribes, higher education institutions across the state and other educational and cultural organizations.
“We wouldn’t be able to get it done without our partnerships,” Fredericks said at a Thursday night reception at United Tribes Technical College celebrating the books’ completion.

The Indigenous Education Coalition — a group that included some of the series’ original authors — and Sacred Pipe Resource Center took the lead on revising the text, according to a project timeline provided by the Department of Public Instruction. They fielded input from tribal colleges, tribal education and historic preservation offices as well as other groups. Updates included incorporating more recent historical events into the textbooks.
“Really, at the heart of this is Indigenous peoples telling their own stories,” said Sashay Schettler, assistant director for Indian and multicultural education at the Department of Public Instruction.
The six-part series includes one introductory textbook and books focusing on each of the five tribes — including an all-new book on the history and culture of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate.
The state initially held off on including Sisseton-Wahpeton since its administrative center is in South Dakota. The idea was that South Dakota could produce a textbook of its own, but that never happened.
So the Department of Public Instruction during the revision process reached out to the tribe to see if it wanted to join the North Dakota textbook series.
Nick Asbury, website content specialist for the agency, said he anticipated it taking at least a couple years to write the book from scratch. The tribe managed to write it in 90 days so it could release alongside the other updated editions, he said.
“I have never seen anything like that,” Asbury said. “It was amazing to see.”

Though the series is written for a K-12 audience, higher ed institutions rely on them for information, too.
The ebooks will be available for free online this summer, according to the Department of Public Instruction. Print editions will be rolled out to schools this fall and also will be available for purchase. 
The original editions of the textbooks are available for free on most ebook platforms.
The agency hopes to revise the books every three to five years going forward. 
Recent grad sees a gap in educational quality for tribal students

Under a law adopted by the state Legislature in 2021, North Dakota K-12 schools are required to teach Native history.
State survey data collected in 2023 indicates schools may be struggling to meet that requirement. The survey found that 75% of teachers and 89% of administrators were aware of the legislation. Additionally, 57% of teachers and 67% of administrators said they were aware of tribal history resources published by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction.
The project was made possible in part because of federal grant funding. Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler noted during the event that the future of some of the Department of Public Instruction’s federal grants remains uncertain.
The agency hopes the new books will become a staple for North Dakota history classes.
“These books today provide a comprehensive and rich resource of material that our educators can use in teaching Native American culture, history and traditions in our state,” Baesler said.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — While growing up in south Lincoln, Loren Eiseley would often venture down to a small stream near his home to gather specimens for his homemade aquarium.
Once, the story goes, he almost drowned while exploring at a nearby pond, a pond now located on the Lincoln Country Club golf course grounds.


A show for Eiseley fans
A musical opera created by Eiseley scholar and performer John Cimino will be performed in May in Omaha and Scottsbluff.
The piece is based on Eiseley’s book, “The Star Thrower,” which highlights the author’s beliefs that “we are of Nature, not above Nature.”
“An Evening with Loren Eiseley’s ‘The Star Thrower’ “ will be performed May 23 at the Western Nebraska Community College recital hall in Scottsbluff at 7:30 p.m. MDT, and on May 27 at 7:30 p.m. CDT at the Strauss Performing Arts Center on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
Cimino, based in New York, is an award-winning composer and concert artist who has performed throughout the U.S. and Europe. He has performed alongside the famous tenor, Luciano Pavarotti, as well as at the International Verdi Festival in Italy, the Wexford Festival in Ireland and the New York City Opera. He is an advocate for the arts in education and professional life, and now serves as president and CEO of Associated Solo Artists.

On Friday, Lincoln officials and Eiseley fans gathered to dedicate a state historical marker along the small stream in Irvingdale Park, a stream that helped inspire the writings of an author once praised by Publishers Weekly as “the modern Thoreau.”
Eiseley, who died in 1977, was an anthropologist, philosopher and natural sciences writer who grew up in Lincoln. After drifting across the West, he graduated from the University of Nebraska with English and geology/anthropology degrees. Eiseley served as editor of the “Prairie Schooner” literary magazine at NU, and participated in digs for fossils and human artifacts across the western part of the state and southwestern U.S.
He later earned a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania, and later taught at the University of Kansas and Oberlin (Ohio) College. Eiseley eventually returned to Penn. At his death, he was the Benjamin Franklin professor of anthropology and history of science.
With 36 honorary degrees, he was said to be the most decorated professor at the University of Pennsylvania since Ben Franklin.
His essays, written in a poetic style, eventually found a wider audience, as did his books, which included “The Immense Journey,” “The Star Thrower” and “The Unexpected Universe.” His friend, science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, said that Eiseley’s writings “changed my life.”
Bing Chen, a long-time engineering professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and president of the Loren Eiseley Society, praised Eiseley at the dedication ceremony as a “great American author” whose writings are “timeless” and still very relevant today given global warming and climate change.
Chen quoted from his writings: “We have joined a caravan … and we will see as far as we can. But we cannot in our lifetime, see all that we wish to see, or learn all that we hunger to know.”
Gaylor Baird said it was fitting that a historical marker be placed along a stream in Lincoln that influenced Eiseley’s writings and philosophy.
His most famous quote, she said, was “If there is magic in this world, it is contained in water” — a quote that was placed on the historical marker.
“I hope this marker inspires people of all ages to pause, to look around — put down their phones — and feel some of the magic in these green spaces that Loren Eiseley felt,” Gaylor Baird said.
She added that a special exhibit on Eiseley’s life had just opened at the Eiseley Branch Library in Lincoln.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Wetlands? Who needs ‘em? They aren’t soaring mountain peaks offering panoramic views. They aren’t ancient trees older than the nation we live in. Yet wetlands are important. Many would say they suffer from ugly duckling syndrome compared to other natural features, but as this former farm boy will tell you, the ugliest hogs always taste the best, and things that aren’t much to look at often have the most value.
Tennessee wetlands for sale? How we got here.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from so-called “isolated” wetlands, or wetlands that lack a surface connection to other bodies of water. In addition to removing federal protections for half of the 118 million wetland acres in the U.S., the ruling set the stage for state legislatures to drastically reshape environmental policy.
Around the same time SCOTUS announced their ruling, Collierville Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan put forth a bill that would limit state oversight on 432,850 wetland acres. That’s more than half of Tennessee’s 787,000 acres of critical wetland ecosystems. The bill targets “isolated” wetlands as identified in the SCOTUS ruling, even though such wetlands are not truly isolated, as they often share groundwater connections with essential waterways and aquifers.
Though he didn’t disclose it in the bill, Vaughan is a real estate developer who stands to benefit from reduced wetland regulation. He’s butted heads before with the state’s wetland regulating agency — the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and he was associated with a development project in 2019 that illegally drained and filled a wetland.

In addition to TDEC voicing concerns about the bill, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) cautioned the bill could lead to an increase in flooding and that the state has suffered its wettest years in history since 2019 with flood events that caused loss of life and billions of dollars in property damage.
Wetlands are essential to Tennessee communities
Wetlands provide a bulwark against droughts and flooding. They replenish aquifers, filter groundwater, and recharge streams, rivers, and lakes. Given their biological makeup, wetlands maintain critical biodiversity and provide essential habitat for organisms that higher orders of life depend on.
Vaughan’s bill received enough pushback in 2024 to send it to a legislative summer study session. But now the bill is back, edited with a few revisions that environmental advocates say don’t pass muster. The amended bill now proposes deregulating wetlands that are less than two acres in size, which would still mean putting most of the state’s wetlands at risk.
All of Tennessee’s wetlands are essential, regardless of their size. According to George Nolan, Director of the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Tennessee office, “An acre of wetlands can hold more than a million gallons of water. The proposed legislation favors the interests of developers over the safety of future flood victims and pocketbooks of Tennessee taxpayers. This is no time to repeal laws that have protected our wetlands for the last 50 years.”
Other opposition groups include the Memphis advocacy organization Protect Our Aquifers and the Maryville-based Tennessee Stormwater Association (TNSA).
“There is little debate in the stormwater community about the value of wetlands as key instruments of maintaining water quality and mitigating flooding,” said Aaron Rogge, TNSA president. “This will be a major change to how the state manages its water resources, and likely one that we’ll look back on as a product of our current political climate.”
Middle Tennessee’s Harpeth Conservancy also voiced opposition by drawing up an analysis of how wetlands benefit communities. Examining just one region, the Harpeth Conservancy outlined 16,000 at-risk wetlands along Middle Tennessee’s Duck River, the state’s longest river and the most biodiverse waterway in North America. The Duck River (which 250,000 Tennesseans depend on for drinking water) relies on nearby wetlands for drought and flood mitigation. If those wetlands were destroyed, the resulting droughts and floods could devastate communities throughout the Duck River watershed.
Republican legislators are willing to risk future prosperity for short-term gain
Under Tennessee’s current regulatory framework, a developer must pay hefty mitigation fees to obtain a permit to destroy wetlands in a projected build site. The fees are then used to restore wetlands in other parts of the state, thus balancing out what is lost by a single construction project.
Duck River, Tennessee waterways could see regulation rollbacks under two proposed bills

Though imperfect, the current model works. Development corporations operate exclusively to maximize profits and return on investment to shareholders — concerns like the health of the environment and the safety of communities are invisible on a corporation’s balance sheet. However, being required to pay hefty mitigation fees does matter, as it reduces incentives for developers to build on wetlands.
If Vaughan’s amended bill passes, it will gut wetland regulations and remove those essential financial disincentives.
Protect wetlands today, elect new leaders tomorrow
Wetlands do something even the greatest engineers could never hope to accomplish with all the tools of mankind at their disposal. They absorb flood waters at a scale that’s difficult to fathom, something all Tennesseans should care about as the state continues to experience year after year of heavy rainfall. Destroying wetlands for development may make some individuals a lot of money in the short term, but the loss of these essential lands will be felt during the rainy seasons to come.
President Theodore Roosevelt once said, “To waste and destroy natural resources is to skin and exhaust the land and undermine the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to our children.” Vaughan and his co-sponsors may care more about short-term profits than long-term prosperity, but Tennesseans of all political stripes should stand in bipartisan opposition to the piecemeal commodification of wetlands that, though some may refer to them as the metaphorical “ugly hog in the barn,” nevertheless provide us with as much value as the most breathtaking Tennessee landscapes.

“I was elected to keep my seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, and I am committed to fighting tirelessly to ensure that the will of North Carolina voters is respected,” Riggs told an audience at NC Central University’s law school on Saturday. “The eyes of the country are on the people of this state,” she said. “Because we are people of resilience, we are people of community, we’re going to show the country what it looks like to fight in tough times.”
Riggs was the final speaker at the “In Our Court” conference, sponsored by Common Cause NC, the American Constitution Society, Emancipate NC, Democracy NC, and about a half dozen other groups. 
On Friday, a majority on the state Supreme Court decided that thousands of absentee ballots cast by members of the military and overseas voters should have included their photo IDs. The court said those voters would have 30 days to provide IDs after the state Board of Elections mails notices. People who don’t provide ID would have their votes in the state Supreme Court election thrown out. 
The court majority decided a few hundred votes from people who live overseas and are connected to the state through their parents should be erased from the Supreme Court race total. 
Riggs, the Democratic incumbent, leads Republican challenger Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes. Her lead in last November’s election has been confirmed in two recounts. In an effort to unseat her, Griffin sued the state Board of Elections to have more than 60,000 votes tossed out. Most of the voter challenges were based on Griffin’s claims of incomplete registrations. 
A Supreme Court’s 4-2 majority reduced the votes in jeopardy to those cast by military and overseas absentee voters.  
Riggs immediately asked federal District Judge Richard Myers for a preliminary injunction, basically to freeze action in case. 
Myers on Saturday ordered the elections board to follow the state court’s instructions for notifying voters what they have to do to have their votes count, but not to certify the election until hearing more from the court. 
The board is to tell Myers by Tuesday how many voters could be affected and which counties they’re in. Myers also set a schedule for written arguments.
The exact number of overseas and military voters affected is unclear. In her dissent, Justice Anita Earls wrote that at least 2,000 to 7,000 military and overseas voters could be affected. Those challenged military and overseas votes could be limited to Guilford County or could include overseas votes from a handful of other heavily Democratic counties Griffin added to his protest. 
“They may be military members who have been serving on battlefronts in war zones,” Riggs said Saturday. “They are foreign service officers who are working to make this whole entire world a safer place to live,” she said. 
The state’s military and overseas voting law is modeled after a federal law meant to encourage service people to vote. These voters were told they did not need to include photo ID with their ballots. Most use an electronic portal that does not allow voters to submit a photo. The majority on the Supreme Court said the state Board should have required overseas voters to supply photo ID.

While Riggs has focused her comments on military voters who may be disenfranchised, the challenged group also includes a high proportion of college-aged voters. 
Griffin has included in his challenge overseas voters from Durham, Forsyth, Buncombe, and Guilford — all counties with significant student populations. The challenged overseas voters in these are five times more likely to be Democrats, said Gunther Peck, founder and co-director of the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke and NC Central universities. The lab’s analysis found that challenged voters in this group are 4.6 times more likely to be between the ages of 18 and 25 than over the age of 65.
More than 260 Duke students living aboard and voted absentee had their votes challenged, Peck said.
Ann Webb, Common Cause NC policy director, said there are still questions the federal court can decide. A big one is whether it’s fair to single out military and overseas voters from a select group of counties.
The “gaping question” of which counties are supposed to be included needs to be resolved, Webb said, and may end up back in state court.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4490-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 06:11:59.796557

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A balanced state budget, more money for correctional facilities and proposed constitutional amendments form just part of the lengthy agenda awaiting Arkansas lawmakers on Monday for a planned three-day work week. 
“We’ve got a lot of work yet to do, so just be prepared that Monday will be a long day and a long evening,” House Speaker Brian Evans, R-Cabot, told the chamber Thursday. “We’re getting close to wrapping this session up and landing this plane. I’m really proud of the job that you’ve done.”
The 95th General Assembly is scheduled to complete most of its work on Wednesday, then recess for a couple of weeks before returning to formally end the session.
In the Senate, the hope is that committees will finish their work by the time the chamber convenes at 10:30 a.m. Monday, said Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs. He added that the chamber could take a break for committee meetings if needed.

After speaking to the House parliamentarian, Hester said Thursday that amended bills passed off the Senate floor Monday will still have time to make it through the legislative process. Hester also said he was open to batching bills, a process that allows multiple bills to be voted on together.
The Senate could have as many as 100 bills on its calendar Monday, according to Hester, who said Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be slower. 
“We’re going to run right through the finish line,” Hester said.
The House adjourned before 5 p.m. Thursday, leaving dozens of Senate bills on the calendar to be taken up this week. Evans said he made this decision after conferring with House committee chairs.
“We felt like the trade-off for a long day Monday [was] being a little rested over the weekend, and cooler heads prevailing would be better than just trying to force stuff through this evening,” Evans told reporters after adjournment.

The Senate bills slated for House votes include one that environmental advocates feared would endanger a moratorium on large animal farms in the Buffalo River watershed. Senate Bill 290 would have to receive Senate approval again since it was amended in the House.
Evans said the governor’s office has told him she supports SB 290, which was amended several times since its introduction in February after negotiations between stakeholders and elected officials.
“I think each [side] had to give a little bit, but in doing so, they brought a better piece of legislation forward,” he said.

 Joint Budget and constitutional amendments

A critical piece of legislation that has yet to receive House and Senate approval is the Revenue Stabilization Act, or the balanced budget for fiscal year 2026. The proposal is nearly identical to the budget Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders proposed in November, Evans said.
The budget totals $6.49 billion and raises spending by 2.89%. The Joint Budget Committee is expected to approve the legislation, House Bill 2003 and Senate Bill 637, at Monday’s 9 a.m. meeting.
Joint Budget is also set to consider Senate Bill 633, filed last week by Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers. SB 633 would transfer $250 million from general revenue to a set-aside fund for correctional facilities. The Legislature placed $330 million into the fund in 2023 for expanding prison capacity.
A $750 million appropriation bill to support construction of a 3,000-bed state prison in Franklin County is likely dead after the Senate failed five times to garner enough support for the measure. 

Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote


Additionally, the House and Senate will finalize which proposed constitutional amendments the Legislature will refer to the 2026 statewide ballot. On Thursday, the Senate approved a proposal to affirm that the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “is a natural, fundamental, and individual right that shall not be infringed.” The measure must receive House committee approval before going to the full House.
The full Senate is expected to vote this week on the House’s proposed amendment, which would affirm that only U.S. citizens can vote in Arkansas. Noncitizen voting is already illegal, and proposed measures to further prevent this failed in the House in March.
The Legislature can refer up to three amendments to voters each election cycle, so lawmakers may also consider a third proposal before the legislative session ends.
 More committee action

Several committees are scheduled to deviate from their typical biweekly meeting schedules in order to finish business this week. For example, the House Education Committee usually meets Tuesdays but will meet at 11 a.m. Monday.
The committee is scheduled to consider Senate Bill 625, which would place some additional restrictions on Education Freedom Account program funding. The state voucher program, one of Sanders’ priorities during her first year in office, allows state funding to be used for qualifying expenses, such as private school tuition and extracurricular activities. 
  Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, addresses the Senate on Tuesday, February 25, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)
The latter caused controversy last year when a Fayetteville stable encouraged homeschoolers via social media to use their EFA funds for horseback riding lessons. Among other things, SB 625 would prohibit spending more than 25% of allocated funds on extracurriculars. The same limit would be placed on transportation expenses.
Bill sponsor Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, told the Senate Thursday the goal is to ensure the money goes toward education-related items. Participants in the 2025-2026 academic year, the third year of the EFA program and the first time it will be open to all Arkansas students, will receive up to $6,864 annually.
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s agenda for 10 a.m. Monday includes Rep. Mary Bentley’s House Bill 1916, a proposed amendment to her Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023. The Perryville Republican seeks to add mental health treatment to the law’s list of gender-affirming healthcare for which doctors who treat transgender minors could face civil liability.
Bentley introduced HB 1916 a day before she withdrew House Bill 1668, which she had previously agreed to amend. That bill would have created civil liability for any adult who aids a minor’s “social transitioning,” but lawmakers, the attorney general’s office and members of the public said the bill infringed on the right to freedom of expression.
Bentley has sponsored several bills related to transgender Arkansans in the past few legislative sessions. She is the House sponsor of Senate Bill 486, which would allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone assigned male at birth in a women’s bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility. The House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs is scheduled to meet twice Monday and is expected to take up SB 486.
The State Agencies committee is also set to hear a bill that outlines a petition process to allow voters to decide whether their local water system contains fluoride, while the House Public Health, Labor and Welfare Committee is scheduled to hear a proposed repeal of the statewide mandate for public water system fluoridation.
Arkansas lawmakers consider suggestions to improve underfunded scrap tire recycling program

The former bill is Senate Bill 613, and Evans said he expects it to pass the House if it passes the State Agencies committee, which is scheduled to meet twice Monday.
“It seems to me that there’s a lot of favor in that one because of the efforts that have been put forth by all the stakeholders in that to get some compromised language,” Evans said.
Meanwhile, the Senate’s equivalent public health panel is set to meet Monday at the call of chairwoman Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. One bill on its agenda is House Bill 1982, which would remove a prohibition on used tire retailers imposing fees, in addition to an existing rim removal fee, to cover their costs. The state’s underfunded scrap tire recycling program has been a regular topic of legislative debate for the past few years.
Lawmakers in both chambers have also been considering three bills pertaining to minors’ social media use, which Sanders has expressed support for regulating.

House Bill 1717 would ban technology companies from collecting data from Arkansas minors except under specific circumstances. The House Committee on Aging, Children and Youth, and Legislative Affairs passed the bill in March and will consider an amended version Monday.
Senate Bill 612 would create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if content on those platforms harms their children. The amended bill is likely to receive a House vote Monday and would need to pass the Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to reach Sanders’ desk before the session ends. The Judiciary Committee is currently not scheduled to meet again after Monday.
Senate Bill 611 would amend the Social Media Safety Act of 2023, an enjoined law that required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. It would need to follow a similar process as SB 612 to reach Sanders’ desk. The Senate Committee on Insurance and Commerce, which passed SB 611 before it was amended, was not scheduled to meet this week as of Sunday.

The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.



	During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.


State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Getty image)When the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) put out a public call for volunteers to revive a state fishing advisory panel, a former panel member warned Jim Riggs against joining.
Riggs, a 75-year-old recreational fisherman and retired electrician who lives in Westerly, applied anyway.
“I feel that in order to have your voice heard when it comes to fisheries management, you’re either on the table or on the plate,” Riggs said in an interview. “I prefer to be at the table.”

His seat at the table is now secured; he is one of nine new members the CRMC named to its Fishermen’s Advisory Board (FAB) after a single, unanimous vote on April 8. The advisory panel has been inactive since all of its former members resigned together in August 2023 to protest what they viewed as the CRMC’s kowtowing to offshore wind project developers at the expense of local fishermen. 
Will the same frustrations bubble up? The first test comes this week, as the new panel begins negotiations with SouthCoast Wind, which has applied for a permit to run transmission lines from its wind turbines up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay. 
Rich Hittinger, a former FAB member who led the mass resignation effort two years ago, isn’t optimistic. 
“We were asked to review a lot of applications and give input that took a lot of time and effort, but then the council really did not care what our input was,” said Hittinger, who is first vice chair of the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association.
He had discouraged Riggs from joining the panel. 
“I think nothing has changed structurally at the CRMC, so I told him that most likely, you will spend a lot of time on these projects and your input will not be considered,” Hittinger said.
Marisa Desautel, the attorney hired to represent the fishing advisory panel in prior negotiations with offshore wind developers, felt the same way.
“The process is the same as it was then — there’s no policy in place other than the language written in the [CRMC rulebook],” Desautel said. 
But Desautel said she would be interested in serving as the attorney for the FAB again if she were asked.

The CRMC through its Ocean Special Area Management Plan (SAMP), created in 2011,  requires input from fishing representatives on any large-scale offshore development. The advisory panel is meant to minimize negative impacts to fishing habitats by offering input on project locations, construction schedules, and other details. And, it can request an attempt to negotiate compensation from developers to offset projected losses to commercial and recreational fishermen from their projects.
But federal regulations limit what the state coastal agency, and its advisory bodies, can do about offshore wind. The CRMC can affirm whether or not a federal offshore wind project complies with state regulations, but the real control lies with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which dictates where projects are built, environmental and economic impacts, and construction and operating plans.
Jeffrey Willis, executive director for the CRMC, acknowledged in an interview that state coastal regulators often had little authority over matters the FAB brought to the council in the past.  
Prior interactions between citizen volunteers and deep-pocketed international companies behind wind projects felt off-balance to Jim Boyd, who served 22 years at CRMC before retiring as its deputy director in 2022. 
“It felt like there was a stacked deck, if you will,” Boyd said.
David v. Goliath
Rhode Island coastal regulators can’t change federal lease and mitigation policies. But they can reduce friction by having FAB members attend fewer meetings for negotiations on offshore wind projects, Willis said. 
“With the old FAB, those guys were super-involved,” Willis said. “They would come every Thursday night for a couple of hours and put their hearts and souls into it, and in the end, they felt they weren’t getting their point across,” Willis said. “We didn’t want to repeat that burnout.”
Willis acknowledged that this won’t fix the difficult-to-calculate financial piece of wind negotiations, which rely on federal fishery landings data that typically does not capture the lived experience of local recreational and commercial fishermen.
“Compensation is one of the hardest discussions to have,” he said.
The new board members are preparing to wade into that difficult discussion on the SouthCoast Wind project, a 147-turbine wind farm planned off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. The CRMC in December 2023 approved the broad strokes of a plan to run the wind farm’s power lines through Rhode Island waters to reach land at Brayton Point in Somerset, Massachusetts. 
Cables would extend up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay — much closer to local fishing grounds than the turbines off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard.

The former fishing advisory board members had already resigned by the time of its decision, so there was no attempt to determine compensation to offset fishing losses.
The CRMC is now reviewing a separate permit application related to the SouthCoast underwater cable lines. An initial meeting between the project developers, the CRMC and the new FAB members is planned for this week, though no date had been confirmed yet, Willis said.
“When the Ocean SAMP was adopted 15 years ago, the whole emphasis was on the offshore impacts,” Boyd said. “There was no consideration of inshore fisheries because there was so much unknown. But now, we know that the SouthCoast export cables are going to be coming into our waters. We need to have representation for that.”
In a statement, SouthCoast Wind welcomed the restoration of the FAB.
“SouthCoast looks forward to meeting with the new FAB members in the coming weeks and continuing to move forward with the Rhode Island CRMC permitting process,” Rebecca Ullman, a company spokesperson, said in an email Friday.
Volunteers step up to the plate
Willis originally reached out to two different area fishing groups to see if they were interested in joining FAB. Both declined. A series of emails to industry listservs earlier this year yielded more success — 12 applicants, including one proposed alternate. 
“I was pleasantly surprised,” Willis said. “I was worried about the possibility that, given the history of what happened with the old FAB, we would have a hard time.” 
Unlike fellow recreational fisherman, Riggs sees the benefits to offshore wind development. He claims the underwater foundations and cables for other projects near Block Island have increased his catch.
“It creates a structure for fish to congregate to and feed at,” Riggs said.










I feel that in order to have your voice heard when it comes to fisheries management, you’re either on the table or on the plate. I prefer to be at the table.


– Jim Riggs, 75, a Westerly recreational fisherman and new member of the Rhode Island Fishermen’s Advisory Board


A self-proclaimed conservationist, Riggs hoped his experience on the water, as well as his avid consumption of news about the wind industry, would help protect Rhode Island’s prized ocean ecosystem. Other volunteers who applied to join the advisory panel also expressed their interest in protecting the state coastal environment, according to letters and emails submitted to the CRMC.
The agency’s regulations allow for up to 20 members on the fishing advisory panel, including up to two representatives each for six categories of fishing; up to two representatives of seafood processing facilities; and up to six Massachusetts fishermen who fish in waters subject to Rhode Island coastal regulations.

All 12 applicants, including the one alternate, were approved as new members, except for one initial candidate who withdrew his name prior to the confirmation, Laura Dwyer, a CRMC spokesperson said. One of the 11 people confirmed Tuesday, Isaiah Alvarez, subsequently decided not to continue as a board member, he said in a text message Thursday night. Alvarez did not respond to questions about his decision.
Half of the applicants identified as recreational or commercial fishermen, including several with former military experience in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard. Another, Patrick Dowling, managing partner at D’Amico Burchfield LLP in Providence, has a bachelor’s degree in environmental science from the University of Rhode Island and concentrated in environmental law at the Vermont Law School, he said in an email to the council. 
Jennifer Scappatura-Harrington, owner of Quonnie Siren Oyster Company in Charlestown, hopes to offer a voice for the state’s aquaculture industry and women in fishing, she wrote in an email to the council. 
Dowling and Scappatura-Harrington did not return calls for comment.

The district superintendent is concerned about the plan’s finer points when it comes to data sharing. (Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Some systems get too complex. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley thinks that has happened with overlapping information technology (IT) and data systems across the city’s government and public schools, which have been under state control since 2019.   
“We should all want the best resources, the best experts, working together,” Smiley said at the Zuccolo Recreation Center on Federal Hill during the April 10 release of “Providence’s Plan for Our Schools: Building a Brighter Future.” 
The report is the city’s first concerted effort to describe how it will resume and maintain control of its schools when the state takeover ends sometime in the next two years. Five of its 63 pages are dedicated to recommendations on how the city thinks IT and data practices should be structured after local control returns.
Smiley wants to align the city and district more closely, and to eliminate redundant software or data collection. “These are opportunities for both efficiency and higher quality services,” he said Thursday.
Among the more ambitious ideas is to broaden the kinds of student data shared between district, city and third-parties to improve city offerings at recreation centers. 
Schools and rec centers “serve the same youth and provide interconnected services, but they frequently use different data collection platforms to track student attendance,” the report notes. “The City will explore where it may merge Recreation Department and PPSD [Providence Public School District] platforms to reduce the number of duplicative systems and improve communication.”
Also on the city’s wish list for local control: A more streamlined model for IT management, with the report stating it wants to investigate which “roles and functions or contracts…may be duplicative” between city and district.
“All of us are vulnerable to cyberattacks. It’s a global trend, as you well know,” Smiley told reporters Thursday. “The city’s IT department will help the school department’s team and vice versa, so we can better protect our students’ data, our employees’ data.”
The mayor’s report notes that “PPSD’s IT department is currently understaffed…[and] no PPSD employee directly oversees the network, and the work has been outsourced to consultants.” An interim IT director has been in place since July 2024, according to a district contract. But the most recent PPSD organizational chart, created after that contract, still shows the top IT position as vacant.
The district also had IT troubles in September 2024, when a ransomware attack on PPSD’s internal systems exposed about 200 gigabytes of district files, including confidential and personal information of staff and students. 
Now the city wants to “enhance long-term sustainability and data security,” according to its new report. “This reliance on external contractors presents risks, including reduced control over internal processes, potential delays in addressing technical issues, and a lack of institutional knowledge of IT systems within PPSD.”

Privacy concerns
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green expressed concern that the city’s plan as-is might violate state law. PPSD Superintendent Javier Montañez is concerned the data sharing aspects may violate federal law, too. 
“The report suggests sharing of student and family data with city structures that would conflict with federal privacy laws,” Montañez wrote in an April 10 letter to the Providence schools community.
The current plan needs “greater specificity, more detailed action steps, and accountable timelines and individuals,” Montañez wrote, and dubbed the report itself an exercise in redundancy, as it “proposes even more City control in day-to-day operations of the District, not less.”
Privacy concerns would fall under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which mandates that schools can’t usually share minor students’ personal information without written consent from parents or guardians. 
The city’s proposal explicitly states that any new data sharing efforts “will comply with relevant federal education data laws,” including FERPA and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA).
A cheat sheet from the U.S. Department of Education notes the four most common exceptions to written consent for students’ personal data. It can be collected in a database if proper safeguards are in place, and researchers and auditors can access student data in certain contexts. 
School officials can access students’ personal information as long as there is “legitimate educational interest” involved, FERPA dictates. And an outside party can be considered a “school official” if it “performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use employees.” PPSD uses similar language in its 2024 template for data sharing contracts.

California is trying
Providence is not the first city or state to attempt integrating select data between municipal and district powers. There’s much guidance on how to construct data sharing agreements. Scale can complicate speed, as has been the case in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom campaigned in 2019 and 2022 for a statewide educational data system that would track students’ progress from preschool through employment. CalMatters reported that as of March 2025, the system is still not ready for public consumption, with one expert citing “an abundance of caution regarding students’ privacy” as a major reason for the delay. 
But Providence operates at a much smaller scale than the Golden State, and the city’s local control report gives one case study of how the district and a third-party entity successfully cooperated to share necessary data. In 2024, the city received $200,000 from the state education department to team up with the Providence After School Alliance and deliver out-of-school programming at two underperforming PPSD middle schools, as part of Gov. Dan McKee’s Learn365 initiative. 
The alliance entered into a data-sharing agreement with the district for information regarding demographics like multilingual learners and free and reduced lunch recipients who participate in the after-school programming. The idea is to “implement a targeted and responsive program that aligns with PPSD’s district-wide priorities…as well as help inform future after-school programming that integrates both academic learning and enrichment,” according to the city report.
It’s also not the first data agreement the alliance and the district have shared. According to a 2012 brief from The Wallace Foundation on “Data-Sharing Strategies That Work,” PPSD and the after school alliance took seven years to forge a different agreement. The brief notes that by making the alliance “a quasi-district entity that’s providing a service…that the district would provide itself but can’t,” the arrangement was able to satisfy FERPA requirements. 
The city and district already use the same public records request software, NextRequest. People seeking information on PPSD send a request through the city’s portal, and the city’s clerical staff satisfy the request.
Smiley and his office have stressed that the report is not final or prescriptive. Spokespeople for both PPSD and the Mayor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

(Getty Images) As a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Kentucky teaching the first-year writing sequence, I facilitate students’ transition to college. I am often the first instructor who knows their names, who sits with them in office hours, and who helps guide them toward the resources necessary for their success. I teach, but I also mentor, triage, and support. I do this at the same time that I am writing my dissertation and advancing my scholarship, and I do this all for $17,000 a year.
For the 2024-2025 fiscal year, the University of Kentucky touted a budget of more than $8 billion. Both President Eli Capilouto and Provost Robert DiPaola have annual salaries exceeding $1 million each. Meanwhile, UK graduate workers — graduate students who teach, do research, and perform essential labor that keeps the University running — make an average of $19,000 a year. 
The MIT living wage calculator estimates that the living wage for a single person with no children living in Lexington is $41,000 a year. Year after year, the University claims that it values and supports its graduate students, but its words do not reflect its actions, and we continue to struggle living on low wages.
On April 9, the University of Kentucky announced new baseline graduate stipends for fiscal year 2026, with baselines increasing across departments by an average of 11%. This is a step in the right direction, but it is still not enough; even the highest baseline still falls below the Lexington living wage. 
Moreover, graduate workers on nine-month contracts (who do not work and are not paid over the summer) will still earn below the baseline. All graduate workers, including those on nine-month contracts, need a living wage. The University of Kentucky cannot function without graduate workers, and teaching assistants (TAs) are essential in providing meaningful education for undergraduates and meeting learning outcomes. It’s time UK pays us what it owes us.
Graduate teaching assistants greatly enhance the undergraduate experience. A student’s first semester can impact the course of their entire education, and as TAs, it is our responsibility to make sure they feel confident, supported, and welcomed at the University of Kentucky. I have written recommendation letters for scholarships, internships, and even graduate school, and my former students continue to update me with their personal and professional successes. Teaching assistants at the University of Kentucky are highly trained, skilled, and qualified, and they change lives every single day.
Moreover, undergraduate students at UK deserve TAs who can provide their very best teaching, and TAs can only do this when we are financially supported. 
When we accept our positions, we sign away our right to seek off-campus employment, despite the fact that our stipends are largely too low to live on. Many TAs, like me, can work on-campus jobs for up to eight hours a week, though we have to jump through dozens of hoops to be able to do so. I cannot do my best teaching when I am worrying about whether or not I will have enough money to feed myself. I cannot do my best teaching the morning after a closing shift, when I am running on little sleep. If the University of Kentucky values our undergraduates, if we want our TAs to be performing at their highest capacity, it must pay us a living wage.
University of Kentucky administrators believe that graduate teaching assistants do not need higher wages because we are only part time trainees. They expect that the tuition waiver, the experience, and the passion we have for teaching is compensation enough. My tuition waiver, my experience, and my passion do not pay my rent. 
TAs work hard creating syllabi, planning and delivering lessons, grading, working with students individually in office hours, and caring for and supporting students in crisis. All the while, we are expected to prepare for our exams, write our dissertations, and apply for jobs. Certainly, TAs receive important training at the University of Kentucky, but we also perform essential labor. 
Without TAs who are supported and financially secure, undergraduate education will suffer. 
Since United Campus Workers (UCW) chartered at UK in 2020, administrators have consistently refused to meet with union members, citing the argument that we are an outside organization. We are not. We are just workers, and these are our demands: $25K baseline stipends for all graduate workers by 2025 without cutting teaching assistant or research assistant lines; an end to discriminatory fees for international students; and a long-term plan to continue adjusting stipends to the cost of living. 
If the University of Kentucky wants to be a leader in the state and in the Southeastern Conference, and if it values undergraduate education, it must pay its graduate workers a living wage.

(NPS/Public domain)As a retired pediatrician, recent recipient of a diploma in climate medicine at the University of Colorado, and board chair of Healthy Air and Water Colorado, I am deeply concerned by recent developments threatening our community’s health.
The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a rollback of its critical endangerment finding, a cornerstone of U.S. climate policy that identifies greenhouse gas emissions as a significant threat to public health and welfare. Despite these challenging times and the daily flood of news from Washington, D.C., this backward action requires our full attention.

This finding is foundational to the essential protections provided by the Clean Air Act. Rolling it back directly undermines the health and safety of every community across the country. Public health is fundamentally nonpartisan — pollution doesn’t differentiate between party affiliation, red and blue states, or rural and urban communities. This policy change threatens every American’s health.
The consequences of weakening these protections are clear: increased toxins in our air and water and heightened pollution in neighborhoods where families live, work, and play. The result is unmistakable: lifelong harm to human health, leading directly to increased rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses, alongside elevated cardiovascular disease risks.
As a pediatrician, I’ve seen firsthand the devastating impacts pollution can have on especially vulnerable children. But there is something we can do about it, especially here in Colorado.
Unlike the troubling federal rollbacks, our state continues to  proactively safeguard public health and our environment. In January, Colorado identified five priority air toxics that require urgent action. This week, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment will release draft rules to manage air toxics and methane emissions specifically from community landfills — a significant source of pollutants.
These local efforts demonstrate a meaningful commitment to protecting public health and maintaining clean air. Yet, they rely heavily on public support and advocacy. Our collective voices matter immensely, and active participation from citizens is critical to maintaining the progress we’ve made and advocating for further positive change. Now is the time for Coloradans to speak up and engage with state lawmakers and regulators to ensure all Coloradans, especially our vulnerable children, are protected from preventable environmental harm.
Public health is not — and should never be — a partisan issue. Colorado must continue to prioritize clean air initiatives and comprehensive pollution control measures, ensuring Colorado remains a national leader in protecting public health.

This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
Developers plan to build Kentucky’s first ‘hyperscale’ data center in Louisville

“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Driving surge in demand for power, data centers eye Kentucky

Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.
Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Photo of UNC-CH by Clayton Henkel/NCNewsline) With weeks left before the spring commencement season gets underway, UNC System President Peter Hans offered the University of North Carolina’s Board of Governors a sobering message at last week’s meeting.
“I believe higher education has been and remains an enormous source of strength for our state and nation,” Hans said. “[But] the public confidence in higher education nationally has fallen, reflecting a broad trend of weakening trust in institutions of all kinds.”
Hans said even with that perception, the system owes it to future generations to fortify North Carolina’s critical engines of knowledge, mobility, and culture.

“In the long history of American public life, periods of ease and harmony are the exception, not the rule. We need universities built for all seasons ready to thrive and play their part in the grand American experiment,” Hans advised.
But being ‘built for all seasons’ did not perhaps envision an administration in Washington determined to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education while threatening to strip federal funding from all universities that refused to comply with its mandates.
In March, Johns Hopkins University announced plans to slash 2,000 jobs as the Trump administration made deep cuts to international aid programs. Columbia University saw $400 million in grants and contracts cancelled due to the university’s alleged “inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Cornell University faces the loss of $1 billion in federal funding. And Raleigh’s News & Observer reports 13 research projects at UNC-Chapel Hill were terminated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Without mentioning the institutions now in the crosshairs, Hans told the Board of Governors that to maintain public trust, it was crucial to stay focused on the core educational mission.
Hans said by following the university system’s strategic plan with a focus on affordability and on-time graduation, the system is seeing improvements in the areas that matter to the state.
“We’ve also taken steps to minimize distractions in this fraught era, again to the focus. Our early adoption of institutional neutrality has allowed campus leaders to focus on their educational roles instead of constantly chasing the news cycle.”
Hans made no mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion, but he did not need to. It’s been almost a year since the UNC Board of Governors voted to repeal the system’s DEI policy.
Legislation that cleared the state Senate last week would further expand restrictions for DEI on North Carolina’s college campuses to include the banning of instruction in “divisive concepts.”
“I’m proud to say the UNC system was ahead of the curve on these critical questions that so many other universities across the country are right now struggling with,” Hans told his colleagues.
Moving forward, Hans said the university system will need to avoid overreaching its mission, lower administrative spending, and find ways to operate more efficiently.
Standing up to ‘strong forces’
Shayna Hill, chair of the UNC System Staff Assembly, used her time before Hans and the governors last Thursday to remind them that there should be space to discuss thorny, complex subjects, even when it can be a messy process.
“Sometimes we get passionate and heated. And sometimes what we advocate for doesn’t make it into the work that we do. But we always come to the table with a desire to make our institutions better,” she said.
But Hill said that ‘strong forces’ right now collectively give the staff pause.
“Some of us are worried about how we will sustain our research. Some of us are worried if students will still have the same options when it comes to financial aid. Some of us are worried about our funding and staffing levels. Some of us are worried about the rising cost of absolutely everything.”
  Shayna Hill, chair of the UNC System Staff Assembly (Screengrab of UNC Board of Governors livestream/PBSNC)
Hill said she was personally distressed by news reports that at least two-thirds of the staff of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, are expected to be laid off.
“I am familiar with the research done to study cancer rates in firefighters as some of this work is done in my own department. This is noble and important research, and I couldn’t help but feeling like we were abandoning these brave folks who worked so hard to keep us safe.”
It felt like a gut punch. She cried briefly at her desk.
Hill reminded the board that UNC staff and faculty fervently believe in their work, even when strong forces seek to disrupt their mission.
“We believe that we can help improve our world through the projects, research and education that takes place in our departments and our institutions. So, when we feel defeated or depressed, we find ways to hold each other up, to elevate each other and to continue to serve the state of North Carolina with love, guts and passion. It is what we are supposed to do.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UNC-CH_Photo_ClaytonHenkel_-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-04-14 06:11:59.796557

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)Seven years of expensive legal wrangling over displaying the Ten Commandments outside of the State Capitol — which opened the door for Satanists to demand their own display of a goat-headed winged creature named Baphomet — should have taught Arkansas legislators the folly of trying to sanction religious messages in a secular republic.
Instead, Arkansas Republicans have launched another pointless adventure in gesture politics by voting to require public schools to post the Ten Commandments — a list that oddly grew from 10 to 12 in an effort to camouflage religious dogma as “historical” text to survive constitutional scrutiny in federal court.
The 10 Commandments bill, sponsored by Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, has been sent to Gov. Sarah Sanders for her signature after passing the House and Senate. It’s the latest example of something that we see far too often at the Capitol: Legislation initiated by political activists from outside of Arkansas — in this case, a father-son duo from Texas — that costs taxpayers money and makes us look ridiculous.
The insurmountable problem in setting out a list of commandments acceptable for public display is that there is no historical or theological agreement about what the 10 Commandments actually are. Most Protestants use a slightly different list than do Catholics and Lutherans, while Jews use yet a third set. Different faiths also number them differently. 
The complexity of the task did not, alas, raise any apparent concerns about its wisdom. Instead, the commandment numbers were just stripped away, and the remaining differences finessed by snatching bits and pieces from all three versions of the Judeo-Christian ethical menu. 
As you can see from the bill’s text, the result is 12 unnumbered commandments, although the first item on the list — “I am the Lord thy God,” a nod to the Jewish version — might be more of a statement of authority than a command.
The list also trims away language used in the biblical passages in Exodus and Deuteronomy on which the commandments are based, including an exhortation not to covet our neighbor’s donkey, although not coveting his cattle still made the cut.
We might be tempted to call this the Razorback Revised Version of the 10 Commandments, except the list follows word-for-word a similar law passed by lawmakers in neighboring Louisiana last year that was quickly blocked by a federal judge.
The version used in Louisiana and in Dotson and Brown’s bill is recognizably Protestant enough to cause problems in federal court. The language is drawn from the post-Reformation King James Version of the Bible, and it includes a prohibition on making “graven images” that Catholics don’t include (which some conservative Protestants cite as evidence of Catholics’ embrace of idolatry.)
The capriciousness of this process was perhaps best summed up on the House floor by one of the only two Republicans who voted against the bill, Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, a former military chaplain: “I’m afraid what this does is it takes something holy and makes it trivial.” 
There is nothing wrong, per se, with promoting ethical precepts. We should all be able to agree that murder, stealing, lying and adultery are destructive and ought to be discouraged, that Mom and Dad should be given their props, and that coveting what other people have is a waste of energy that only leads to discontent (the latter being a central tenet of Buddhism.)
But here, those ethical standards are embedded within an overtly sectarian framework. They flow from the authority of a deity, not merely from the desire to be decent human beings and treat each other with respect.
Arguing that a list that starts out with “I am the Lord Thy God,” prohibits idolatry right off the bat and demands recognition of a Sabbath is not a religious teaching is in a word incredible, as is the idea that passive exposure to the 10 Commandments on a classroom wall will somehow make students better people in the absence of more hands-on ethical instruction. Or get them to stop worshipping Baal.
This particular bill of goods was sold to Arkansas legislators by David and Tim Barton, a father and son team from Texas who lead WallBuilders, a group that promotes the pseudohistory that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and opposes the separation of church and state.
Dotson and Brown let the Bartons explain the rationale for the bill during committee hearings, where they insisted that it was simply a way to revive the 10 Commandments as an historical artifact.
Tim Barton illustrated this claim by noting that the commandments were published in the 17th century New England Primer and in the McGuffy Readers, a textbook popular in the middle of the 19th century: “If there’s something we’ve always done in America, it’s probably fine to keep doing it.”
Of course, there were a lot of things that we did in America until the Supreme Court told us we had to stop, which it did 45 years ago in striking down a Kentucky law mandating display of the 10 Commandments in public schools.
The Bartons are resting their hopes on a different outcome this time around because of a 2022 Supreme Court decision that said school officials could not prevent a high school football coach from leading post-game prayers with his players.
Most Arkansas legislators were assuaged by this argument. But voluntary prayer that takes place in a school setting is a much different animal than mandating that public schools post religious dogma.
Indeed, Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, warned her colleagues, to no avail, that the Supreme Court has consistently maintained promoting religious messages in schools has a “coercive” impact on students that is constitutionally impermissible — an argument echoed by the judge who struck down Louisiana’s law.
Of course, it’s easy for the Bartons to advocate for moving full steam ahead in defiance of binding Supreme Court precedent because, if Arkansas gets dragged into federal court, they won’t be on the hook for the legal costs. We will. 
Indeed, gesture politics can be a rather expensive hobby, which ought to be a compelling argument for Arkansas legislators to stop indulging in it. But, hey, somebody has to protect our cattle from all that unneighborly coveting.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia barrels toward a high-stakes House of Delegates election in November, a dozen Republican incumbents are quietly banding together in what they’re calling the Purple Caucus — an informal alliance of lawmakers fighting for political survival in the increasingly competitive terrain of suburban and swing districts.
It’s a defensive maneuver born out of shifting political dynamics and the lingering effects of the state’s 2021 redistricting, which redrew the legislative map in ways that now expose more Republican-held districts to Democratic threats. 
Adding fuel to the fire is the broader national climate, driven by the economic turbulence under President Donald Trump’s second term that has become a backdrop Democrats are weaponizing on the campaign trail.
In February, Virginia Democrats launched a pointed ad campaign zeroing in on GOP incumbents in vulnerable seats. 
The digital spots sought to link Republicans to tech billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump appointed to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). As a photo of Trump and Musk flashes on the screen, the narrator accuses, “Virginia Republicans are following the leader — cutting taxes for them. Leaving us to foot the bill.”
Even in a tough political year for Democrats, Kamala Harris in November carried 59 of the state’s 100 House districts, according to the Virginia-based State Navigate site. 
Meanwhile, Republicans are holding several seats where Trump either lost outright or failed to clear a majority — and even more where his margin hovered just above 50%. These figures suggest the GOP is defending ground it once considered safe.
By contrast, Democrats are on steadier footing: none of their legislators represent districts that Trump carried, and only a handful are in districts where Harris’ margin of victory was below 55%.
One of the Republicans feeling that pressure is Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County. Her redrawn District 71 — encompassing Williamsburg and parts of James City and New Kent counties — has trended blue in recent cycles. In 2024, Harris edged Trump there by nearly five points, and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Hung Cao by a similar margin.

Batten has taken the lead in organizing the group of Republicans in competitive districts, saying the idea came about in part because Democrats seemed to single them out in early attacks. 
“We kind of came up with it based on the composition of our districts,” she said, “but after the legislative session, the Democrat caucus did some hit pieces with YouTube ads targeting 12 members of our caucus.”
She described the Purple Caucus as informal — more like a support network than a strategic war room. 
“We don’t have actual caucus meetings where we get together or anything like that,” Batten said. “We chit-chat back and forth, but that’s about it.”
Still, members share tactics and tips. Many are new to office, and Batten said the group provides a venue for swapping campaign insights.
“If any of us find some best practices or have some good ideas that we think would be useful,” she added, “then we try to share those and collaborate with each other.”
In her own race, Batten has worked closely with Richmond-based consultant Brett Feinstein — but noted she’s also looped him in to help other Purple Caucus members. 
“Obviously I’m in a competitive district, and he does some work for me,” she explained. “And anything that I think would be useful to other members in competitive districts, I share that with him, too.”
House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, acknowledged the group’s existence but described it in minimalist terms. 
“It’s an informal gathering of members who may be more vulnerable than others and find themselves in swing districts or suburban districts,” he said. “There’s nothing magical about it — just people who have a common interest in, of course, winning reelection and representing their districts.”
 Swing district pressure mounts

Besides Batten, other Republicans in districts Trump lost include Del. David Owen, R-Henrico (House District 57); Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield (HD75); Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg (HD82); Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake (HD89); Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton (HD86); Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield (HD73); and Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William (HD22).
Several others represent districts Trump won with razor-thin margins, including Del. Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun (HD30), and Del. Chad Green, R-York (HD69). Also on the watchlist are Delegates Paul Milde (HD64), Bobby Orrock (HD66), Anne Ferrell Tata (HD99), Rob Bloxom (HD100), and Tony Wilt (HD34) — all representing areas where Trump carried between 52% and 55%.
Political scientist Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington sees this as part of a larger trend. He said when parties become more ideologically rigid, lawmakers from swing districts can start to feel squeezed. 
“This is a constant problem,” Farnsworth said. “For years, Congress had what they called the Blue Dog Caucus, where more moderate Democrats tried to chart a different course than the party leadership.”
He added that as Virginia politics more closely mimic the hyper-partisan combat of Washington, it makes sense that centrist Republicans are looking for ways to stay afloat. 
“It behooves any political party to make people feel welcome if at all possible,” Farnsworth said. “An open split within the party would not be helpful for the party’s fortunes in November.”
But signs of strain are already surfacing. Batten said her relationship with Gilbert, the caucus leader, is distant — and that she’s felt a lack of support. 
“I don’t really have any communication with Todd, he does not communicate with me,” she said. Though she sees him during every legislative session, she added, “outside of that, I honestly couldn’t begin to tell you the last time we had a one-on-one conversation.”
Batten, pointing to what she described as Gilbert’s growing detachment during the 2024 legislative session, said he “seems very much like he has a foot out of the door.” 
She noted that his disengagement has been especially evident in recent months — a period during which Gilbert also submitted his name for consideration to become the next U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. 
“As the leader, he sort of drives the train when it comes to fundraising and all of that,” Batten added. “And that can be challenging.”
 GOP leadership tensions surface

Gilbert pushed back on the idea that he’s not doing enough for swing-district Republicans. 
“That’s certainly not my perception,” he said. “I think I have always been hyper-aware of the fact that our fortunes lie in these purple swing districts.”

His broader concern, Gilbert said, has been reminding colleagues from deep-red districts that winning back the GOP’s legislative majority hinges on what happens in marginal seats.
“But there are not just purple districts on one side,” he said. “There are people that are also vulnerable in the Democratic offices.”
Gilbert also rejected any notion that he’s disengaged from his role as minority leader, insisting he remains fully committed. 
“I absolutely have not checked out,” he said. “There are certainly people who fancy themselves the leader who don’t have that responsibility and who choose to act out in other ways, and criticizing me is one way of doing that.”
Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a member of the Purple Caucus, said he has no complaints about Gilbert’s leadership or his engagement with members in competitive districts. 
“Members of the caucus support each other,” he said. “We recognize that everybody comes from a different district and everybody has to run in their community, and that’s been very well supported.”
When he was first elected to the House in 2023, Obenshain narrowly defeated Democrat Lily Franklin with just 50.31% of the vote — despite Trump and the ultimately unsuccessful Cao carrying the district. 
Obenshain is slated for a rematch with Franklin in November. He said the GOP caucus has long understood that lawmakers from different parts of the state can’t all run the same playbook. 
“The concerns in my district are different from the ones in Tidewater or Northern Virginia,” he said. “But we all support each other.”
And while he acknowledged the Purple Caucus exists, Obenshain dismissed the idea that it’s anything out of the ordinary. 
“I don’t think there’s anything really unusual or unique about it,” he said. “When you have things in common with folks in other districts, you kind of talk about that.”
Unlike their Republican counterparts, House Democrats have not formed a similar coalition.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the first he heard of the Purple Caucus was when asked about it for this story — and he didn’t mince words. 
“There is a Purple Caucus? They aren’t red and they aren’t blue?” he said, chuckling. “And Delegate Batten is supposed to be moderate now? That’s funny, because she’s not moderate. She’s as extreme as everybody else.”
Scott said Republicans creating new caucuses shows internal disarray. 
“They’re wrong on the issues,” he said, “and they probably need to create another caucus — a common sense caucus — because right now they’re too terrified of Trump to do anything to change course.”
Ken Nunnenkamp, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, offered a more pragmatic view. He said groups like the Purple Caucus are normal in a campaign cycle and don’t indicate disunity. 
“I think the word caucus is always an interesting term, because people start to use a caucus for anything,” he said. “But I don’t think there’s anything strange about legislators grouping to talk about campaign strategies.”
Nunnenkamp emphasized that the most competitive districts — the very ones where many Purple Caucus members are running — were also the most expensive races in 2023, and he expects the same in 2025. 
But with Republicans now unified behind Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears as the party’s gubernatorial nominee, Nunnenkamp said the party has sharpened its focus. 
“Now that we have a nominee for governor, everyone is now rowing in the same direction,” he said, “trying to win back the House of Delegates, and that does involve holding all of our competitive seats and picking up a couple of new seats.”

(Getty image)AARP’s mission is to empower people to choose how we live as we age. Financial security in retirement is essential to that empowerment. That’s why AARP works hard to ensure that people don’t lose their nest eggs to fraud. Unfortunately, fraud is everywhere — be it grandparent scams, government impostor scams, romance scams, investment scams, the list goes on — and one of the fastest-growing ways criminals are stealing money from their victims is by directing them to cryptocurrency ATMs to deposit funds.
These machines, also known as “crypto kiosks” or “virtual currency kiosks,” look like bank ATMs, and can be found in retail locations in convenience stores, supermarkets, gas stations and smoke shops in most neighborhoods. They allow people to conduct legitimate cryptocurrency transactions, but criminals are increasingly using them to carry out fraudulent activity. In fact, since 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports a tenfold increase in funds lost in the United States to scammers using crypto ATMs. Rhode Island State Police report an explosive increase in cryptocurrency fraud. There were three cases reported in 2023; 40 cases in 2024; and already 23 cases in the first three months of 2025 – on track to nearly triple this year. And all of the victims were over 50 years old.
Why are crypto ATMs being used in scams? For one, criminals exploit the fact that most of us are unfamiliar with them and can easily convince us that they are legitimate “federal payment kiosks,” as one victim of a “jury duty” scam was told.  
Second, as there are no daily transaction limits, crypto ATMs can be an incredibly lucrative payment vehicle for criminals. Westerly Police Chief Paul Gingerella, in testimony submitted to the Rhode Island Senate Commerce Committee, reported his department has, as an example, “investigated cases where individuals have deposited and lost $40,000 in just two days and multiple instances of $15,000 or more losses in a single day.”










Rhode Island State Police report an explosive increase in cryptocurrency fraud. There were three cases reported in 2023; 40 cases in 2024; and already 23 cases in the first three months of 2025 – on track to nearly triple this year. And all of the victims were over 50 years old.


Finally, the kiosks quickly move the victim’s cash into tough-to-trace cryptocurrency accounts owned by criminals, vastly increasing the likelihood that the criminals will get away with their crime. Unlike banks, which offer some protection, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means that if you get scammed, it’s very hard to get your money back. This total lack of consumer protection is a tremendous concern.
AARP Rhode Island has worked with Sen. Victoria Gu, a Westerly Democrat, and Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, to introduce legislation that, if passed, will ensure that these machines are less attractive to criminals looking to steal the life savings of older Rhode Islanders and ensure that victims have recourse. It would require extensive disclosures prior to transactions, implement a daily transaction limit, require a detailed receipt, require licensing and quarterly reporting to the Department of Business Regulation — and implement a refund policy in instances of fraud. 
AARP Rhode Island applauds the House of Representatives for its overwhelming passage of House Bill 5121 on April 10. We now look forward to working with Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and the Senate to pass Senate Bill 16 and urge them to act soon before one more older Rhode Islander loses their hard-earned savings. Rhode Islanders must be protected from the financial devastation wrought by criminals who bleed them dry.

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Two months after a deadline imposed by lawmakers, the Virginia Department of Education published four of its five overdue reports, detailing progress on funding programs, how school divisions perform under quality standards and outcomes for special education students in private day schools. 
Two of the reports published by the department included summaries on teacher salaries compared with other states and how funds are used in several programs to provide students with extra help with their studies and learning to read. The other reports were summaries on how localities are meeting the Standards of Quality, or the set minimum requirements to support school divisions, and on the outcome data for students with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools.
The fifth report, which is still outstanding, is survey results of school-level teaching conditions and the impact such conditions have on teacher retention and student achievement.
The reports, typically requested by lawmakers, help them make legislative and funding decisions.
When the reports reached a two-month delay, on March 2, state lawmakers contacted the agency, specifically Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera and then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons, about the delayed reports. 
Within a week, Coons signed four completed reports, between March 6-10. 
The following week, Coons resigned from her position.
Since then, the agency has welcomed Emily Anne Gullickson as the superintendent of public instruction. Gullickson’s appointment will be considered by the General Assembly.
Questions linger after Coons’ sudden resignation from Va. education department

In response to the Mercury’s questions, the Department of Education did not explain why the reports were delayed or how four of them were able to be produced so quickly once lawmakers pushed for their submission. The Department said it “sends assigned reports to the General Assembly immediately upon completion.”
Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, signed the letter directed to Coons and Guidera in March requesting the reports that provide “critical information” that they said will be essential for future discussions. 
The two lawmakers, who chair their respective education committees in the Senate and House, requested a timeline for completion and submission of each report. Instead, the agency published four of the five reports without the two receiving a response as to why the reports took as long as they did to be published.
“The reality is that there’s clearly a lot of internal strife inside of the administration. That’s why there’s been so much turnover at the superintendent level and within the department,” Rasoul said. “I think that there are many good people, both within the administration and in the legislature, who are trying to just focus on improving Virginia schools. However, there are too many folks, including the governor, who have just hyper-politicized every move in education.”
In addition to the overdue reports, Hashmi said the list of delays also includes a delay in the release the results of the state assessments “for parents and students and teachers to take a look at an individual student’s performance” and the teaching guidelines for the history and social science standards to help provide resources for teachers before the fall. 
“They were supposed to be available at least last year, and here we are still waiting for them,” Hashmi said.
She said past reports under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration have also included errors and have had quality issues. 
“I’m hoping that we’ll see some changes now under a new leadership,” she said.

(Photo courtesy Richmond SPCA)The save rate for homeless dogs and cats in Virginia’s shelters last year was 86% – just 4% shy of the nationally-recognized no-kill benchmark of 90%. 
Data from Best Friends Animal Society reveals at least 80 of the state’s shelters are already no-kill, and most others are within reach of it, demonstrating a deep commitment among private and public shelter workers, rescue groups and community members to save all the homeless animals who can be saved – those who are healthy or treatable and not a risk to public safety. This progress puts Virginia close to becoming the nation’s largest no-kill state, a lifesaving milestone that can be accomplished with continued support from residents across the commonwealth. 
To close the gap and achieve no-kill, Virginians can prioritize three key strategies: adoption, prevention and collaboration.
If 5,726 more households – just 0.2% – had adopted a pet from a shelter instead of purchasing from breeders, pet stores or online retailers last year, we would have reached a statewide 90% save rate. Virginia’s shelters are brimming with wonderful pets of all ages, shapes, sizes and personalities, each waiting for a loving home.

Equally critical to adoption is preventing animals from entering shelters in the first place. Pet guardians should spay and neuter their companions; humanely manage unowned, free-roaming community cat populations; and proactively utilize shelter-provided resources designed to keep pets in loving homes. 
And lastly, the animal welfare community needs to intensify its collaborative efforts, delivering help and support to under-resourced shelters and facilitating pet transfers to alleviate capacity issues when they arise. 
The Richmond SPCA became no-kill in 2002, and we are driven to create and sustain a no-kill community. We help achieve this by providing high-volume spay and neuter services, pet food pantries, crisis boarding, low-cost veterinary care and training while also directly sheltering, rehabilitating, and rehoming 4,000 animals annually. And, over the last 10 years, we have welcomed about 25,000 animals into our care from more than 50 Virginia partners, easing the burden of overcrowding.
No-kill for Virginia is not an aspiration. It’s an imminent reality. We are on the cusp of guaranteeing a future where every healthy and treatable animal in Virginia’s shelters finds a home. We are the solution – every one of us. And together we can accomplish no-kill for the homeless animals in our shelters because they deserve nothing less.

Mohan, a junior at Brecksville–Broadview Heights High School in Cuyahoga County, wants to be a doctor and no longer has any interest in going to medical school in Ohio. 
“DEI and medical education has always been really important to having equitable doctors and equitable healthcare,” she said. “If that’s not the environment that I’m going to be in when I get to medical school, I don’t want to be here at all in Ohio.”
The new law will ban diversity efforts, regulate classroom discussion, prohibit faculty strikes, and regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, among other things. The law applies to public universities and community colleges and is set to take effect in June. 
Mohan is now looking into applying to Northwestern University and schools in Chicago and New York “ because they do have more liberal policies, especially with DEI,” she said. 
Michelle Huang, a junior at Olentangy Liberty High School in Delaware County, still plans on applying to Ohio State, but admits she’s less motivated to attend. She is also thinking about applying to the University of Michigan and schools on the East and West coasts. 
“It is just really daunting to see how much is being done against DEI and being done against systems that are put in place for a reason and that are helping us currently,” Huang said. “It’s just really disheartening to see this happen in Ohio.”
She wants to pursue political science and economics in college and eventually go to law school. Huang was one of the more than 1,500 people who submitted opponent testimony against S.B. 1. 
Claire Witalec, a freshman at Laurel School in Cuyahoga County, is curious to see how the new law will have changed higher education in Ohio by the time she starts applying to colleges in a couple of years. 
“By the time I’m attending college, if views are being stifled in Ohio, I would definitely want to think about out-of-state options, but I think it really depends on how this bill evolves over the next few years,” she said. 
Mayya Sharma, a sophomore at Cuyahoga Falls High School in Summit County, said she is curious to see how universities implement the new law and “how restrictive that might be.”
“Now that this bill is passed, it’s really pushed me to go to colleges and states that have more, kinder DEI policies,” Sharma said. 
John O’Keefe, president of Ohio University’s American Association of University Professors chapter, thinks the new law will give students pause before applying to Ohio universities. 
“This really sends a message to so many potential students that they’re not welcome and this is not a place for them,” he said.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)A measure moving through the Ohio Senate would direct public schools to display historical documents like the Declaration of Independence or the Bill of Rights. It also includes the Ten Commandments, a religious document. The measure is one example in a wave of state legislation attempting to roll back a bright line separating religious displays from public school classrooms.
The proposals take their cue from a bill in Louisiana requiring the display of the Ten Commandments. Five school districts challenged that law. A district court judge blocked it from taking effect, but only in those districts. The case is currently before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Ten Commandments law in Kentucky. But following a 2022 decision in favor of a high school football coach who regularly prayed with players at games, religious organizations sense an opening.
A Stateline report earlier this year found legislation modeled on Louisiana’s bill in 15 states. That list doesn’t include Ohio’s measure.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

What it does
The sponsor, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, contends the bill will expose students to documents that have “served as the backbone of our legal and moral traditions as a people.” Schools can also set up monuments inscribed with one of the documents on the list.
An amendment, adopted last week, directs classrooms to display at least four of the approved documents for all classes from 4th grade to 12th.
The lineup includes what you’d expect. In addition to the Declaration and the Bill of Rights the Constitution is an option. But several others, while significant, are a bit of a stretch for a grade school classroom. Schools could display the Articles of Confederation or the Northwest Ordinance. They could go back even further to the Mayflower Compact or Magna Carta.
“Simply put,” Johnson argued, “This legislation intends to reintroduce disciplined historic principles — those same principles upon which our Founding Fathers drew inspiration and put to writing — back to the classroom.”
Classes could also display the United States or Ohio motto. Both were established in the 1950s more than a century after the last Founding Father died.
Support and pushback
For all Johnson’s insistence on legal traditions and historic principles, his supporters give the game away. Among those urging lawmakers to pass the bill, there are no historians or legal scholars, no societies dedicated to the founding or to teaching young people.
Instead, there are just three groups, all of them Christian organizations, backing the effort: The Family Research Council, Christian Business Partnership, and Ohio Christian Alliance.
Last week Ohio Christian Alliance President Chris Long testified that the displays offer “a complement” to existing social studies curriculum. “Students remember better when they have visual aids,” he said.
Democrats on the committee asked whether they should leave decisions about displays to the teachers actually leading classes. Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, drew comparison to the Christian Alliance’s longstanding offer to provide state lawmakers with a framed copy of the Ten Commandments.
“Do you think that might be the way to go in this case?” he asked, suggesting school districts should have the same choice.
Sen. Catherine Ingram, D-Cincinnati, zeroed in on a provision setting a July 1, 2026 deadline, but only for displays stemming from donations. Although Republicans on the panel didn’t offer a straight answer, it appears the deadline would apply to all displays. The measure requires districts to determine the overall cost and then accept either donated funds or donated displays to meet the requirements.
The measure received much harsher criticism at an earlier hearing. Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio, rejected arguments that the Ten Commandments are one choice among many, or fundamental the country’s founding. The organizations supporting the bill will start lobbying districts if the bill passes, he argued, and commandments about worship, respecting parents or prohibiting adultery have nothing to do with the founding of the United States.
In short, he said, the bill is “a plainly obvious attempt to impose explicit religious beliefs and practices on young, captive audiences in our public schools.”

The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with for-profit, private prison companies. (Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images) The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

 
During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

 
Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.










They're incentivized to cut corners.

Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

 
State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC) Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

But Ohio House Republicans have nixed it in their version of the state budget passed last week.
Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart, the Ohio House Finance Committee chairman, said the House’s budget proposal passed Wednesday includes a $226 million increase from 2025 public education funding amounts.
Democratic legislators and education researchers say that still leaves public school funding underfunded by billions over the next two years, with more than 300 districts only receiving increases of $50 per student.
Gov. Mike DeWine’s budget proposal funded public education through the Fair School Funding Plan model, but his budget didn’t account for inflation, leaving advocates (and the plan’s co-creator) pressing for money to cover those costs.

The Ohio House went another way, forgoing the funding model that’s been in place for the last two budget cycles and was set to see its third and final phase-in this budget cycle.
The House draft included a provision that Republican leaders said provide property tax relief.
The measure would require the County Budget Commission to lower property tax rates in school districts with cash reserves equalling more than 30% of their operating costs, which critics of the plan say would force districts to dip into their reserves.
Ohio House Republicans increased funding for private school voucher programs.That includes a maximum award for the Autism Scholarship and the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship, and the establishment of an education savings account for private school education.
House Democrats and public school advocates are against the changes.
Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, a co-sponsor of past Fair School Funding Plan legislation, said the proposed House funding model is “based not on what it costs to educate a child, but what the General Assembly decides that it feels like paying for education.”
New Philadelphia City Schools would receive $8.5 million over the next two years based on the House’s budget plan, but the removal of the Fair School Funding Plan model would cost them nearly as much, one of the district’s board members said
“When we can’t count on steady support from the state, eventually we could have to make cuts or ask voters to pass more levies — something no one wants to do,” said Jennifer Schrock, a board member and member of the All in For Ohio Kids Coalition, a public school advocacy group.
Researchers at the think tank Policy Matters Ohio said the budget “underfunds Ohio public schools by $2.75 billion over the biennium” with the removal of the previous funding model.
Policy Matters Executive Director Hannah Halbert said 323 districts in the state would see a mere $50 more per student in the next two years.
“Representatives are heading home on recess having put their names on a bill that gives Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam $600 million and Ohio kids 50 bucks,” Halbert said.
She was referring to $600 million Republicans put in the House budget to underwrite a new football stadium for the Browns’ billionaire owners.
The budget draft would establish a new system for private school voucher dollars.
In an addition not included in the governor’s proposal, the House brought in a new system for “comparing the performance data of state scholarship students enrolled at the chartered nonpublic schools with the data of similar students in nearby schools.”
The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce already tracks enrollment numbers for public and private schools, along with breakdowns based on scholarship recipients. It would be tasked with continuing that work, noting total enrollment at private schools, the number of scholarships students, the type of scholarship and the the amount of state support the school received.
Applicants for the private school voucher scholarships would be required to include the school in which they were previously enrolled before applying for the scholarship.
Also a part of the data collection would be the number of students receiving various voucher scholarships such as EdChoice, EdChoice expansion and Cleveland scholarships, with the information separated by family income “as the data is available,” according to budget documents.
The Ohio Senate is now holding budget hearings and working toward its own draft, which legislators have said may be released next month.

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.
Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Screenshot, National Inventory of Dams)Unlike most states, New Hampshire owns a significant portion of dams within its borders — 276 of more than 2,600. Sustainably funding their upkeep poses challenges that lawmakers are still trying to solve.
Current revenues make the rehabilitation schedule for the state-owned dams a century long, according to a study committee report published in the fall, amounting to about $414 million. Some are more urgent than others; for instance, of the 64 state-owned dams classified as “high hazard” — meaning their failure could result in loss of life — 33 are in poor condition, according to the chief engineer at the Department of Environmental Services’ Dam Bureau.
Dam upkeep has been largely funded through capital improvement appropriations, but the department has sought a more sustainable funding model, prompting the study committee and a bill this session that offered a path for more reliable funds. That bill has been retained in committee, however, as lawmakers continue to weigh what that model should be.
“It’s imperative, in my view, that we find a sustainable funding source,” DES Commissioner Robert R. Scott told lawmakers at a committee hearing in February. “I will say, the actual mechanism of how the funding happens, we’re agnostic at this point. We just want to make sure that ultimately we get to a point where we can find a sustainable way to fund these dams and make sure, again, New Hampshire’s economy and people are safe and sustained.”
If a dam is in an unsafe condition, Scott said, “it is possible we will be forced to unilaterally lower the level of that dam to make it safe.” 
He added: “This is not a case where if things aren’t funded, it’s OK. The dam deteriorates whether you fund it or not, stating the obvious, I know.”
There’s likely thousands of properties and road crossings that would be impacted if state-owned dams failed, Corey Clark, the bureau’s chief engineer, told lawmakers. But he also noted that only 27 of the state-owned dams are flood control structures, meaning about 90% aren’t for flood retention. “There would likely be less of a risk to those downstream individuals if that dam wasn’t in place,” Clark said. “Because that dam is there, the water body is created; the threat is created.”
More of the state-owned dams have been classified as “high hazard” over time — roughly doubling over the last 20 years — because of people moving downstream of them. This classification doesn’t actually say anything about the condition of the dam, but rather describes the risk it poses if it were to ever fail. And, Clark told lawmakers, a higher hazard dam must meet higher thresholds for handling storm events and other criteria, meaning they require work to meet those standards after being reclassified. 
Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte recommended the Legislature appropriate $10.81 million in capital improvements for dam repairs and reconstruction in House Bill 25. “The Dam Bureau has seen an increase in capital appropriations over the last several budget cycles due to the ongoing needs at state-owned dams,” Clark said in an email. He told lawmakers the bureau currently relies “solely” on capital funds for major repair projects. 
In 2019, that capital appropriation was over $4.14 million; in 2021, it was $8.1 million; and in 2023, because of a $30 million influx of federal funds, it was $750,000, Clark said. 
“This is not a knock on the General Court, but the level of funding we’ve been receiving puts us on a 100-year cycle to rehabilitate the 276 dams,” Scott said, “and that … was very concerning for me.”
The money being appropriated this year “will be used to address issues at several state-owned dams from preparing designs to performing construction,” Clark said. Still, while “this will certainly help address the backlog of capital needs at state-owned dams,” he said, “it is likely that more funding will be needed in the future to fully address the needs at these dams.” Of the $414 million needed, $300 million is for the 64 state-owned high hazard dams alone, he said.
Another budget bill, House Bill 2, proposes increasing annual registration and permitting fees for dams, paid by public and private owners, and sets up a mechanism so the fees increase automatically each year starting in 2027 in line with changes in consumer prices. These fees go to the bureau’s dam safety program, Clark said, which “is responsible for ensuring that over 2,600 regulated dams in the state are constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with dam safety regulations,” as well as “reviewing and approving all emergency action plans required for significant and high hazard dams and with assisting state and local officials and dam owners during times of flooding or dam related emergencies.”
The program’s work is funded through registration and permitting fees, as well as the general fund. With the fee increases, the program “will be able to continue providing the same services to dam owners and the public without the need for state general fund appropriations,” Clark said. These are the first time the fees, introduced in 1990, have been increased since 2007, he said.
The study committee launched this summer sought to find a sustainable solution to funding repairs. The bipartisan group of lawmakers held five public hearings on the topic of the state-owned dams, and ultimately recommended fees aimed at prime beneficiaries of dams – boaters and those on waterfront properties. 
But the proposal faced an uphill battle in the Legislature. The House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee voted to retain House Bill 629, which aims to implement those recommendations. In online testimony submissions, 26 were opposed and seven in support. A number of those against the bill felt it was unfair to waterfront property owners and could pose substantial financial burdens for some, arguing that others use and benefit from the water bodies.
Sara Holland, a real estate broker and chair of the public policy committee of the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, said funding the maintenance should be a “collective responsibility not solely borne by a subset of property owners.”
“Targeting only waterfront property owners for dam maintenance funding is inequitable as it disregards the broader community that benefits from the dam’s existence,” Holland said, “including recreational users and businesses that gain from tourism and water resources.”
Part of the department’s goal at this juncture, its commissioner said, is to raise awareness.
“I truly believe the average citizen doesn’t really think about the dam that’s holding up the impoundment,” Scott said. “I’m here to tell you … unless you’re using a canoe or a kayak, I guarantee you that water body you’re putting your boat in, for example, is supported by a dam.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-16-at-4.21.22-PM-1024x776.png,,,2025-04-14 05:03:26.461108

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)If you think primary elections don’t matter all that much, I’m living proof that—at least in school board elections in Pennsylvania—you are quite mistaken.
The primary is coming up in May, and many school board races will be won or lost as a result.
Because candidates for board director can cross-file with both major parties in the primary, those who do so are at a significant advantage in the general election, as in November many voters cast their ballots for candidates according to party affiliation. Even though straight-ticket voting is no longer allowed in Pennsylvania, cross-filed candidates are likely to get substantial party-line votes from both Republicans and Democrats, if only because “school board races can be low-information races,” and often newcomers are entirely unknown.
More importantly, because no party may offer more candidates on its slate than there are seats to be filled, each candidate who successfully cross-files effectively reduces the competition in the general election. 
If there are unfilled party slots after the primary, the parties have the right to fill those with candidates of their choice. But during the primary itself, the people speak, and it actually is one of the few chances we all have to make a real political difference in our local communities. Furthermore, write-in candidates have a real uphill battle, especially since stickers are no longer allowed, “because the ballot-scanning machines cannot read them and may become jammed.”
I myself was elected four times in large measure because when I ran, I cross-filed in the primary in May and thus won a slot on the general election ballot the following November representing both parties.  As a practicing Quaker, I’ve never belonged to a political party because of what I perceive as their inherently divisive nature. 
I’ve been willing to accept the nomination of both parties, however, and tried to keep that in mind. I did my best to follow the leadings of my conscience as I attempted to serve in the best interest of all the children and all the constituents in my Adams County district. I expect the same of all elected officials, and schools are where the rubber really hits the road for a lot of us politically.

My experience on my board suggests to me that many school districts are trying hard to put the best interests of their students first and to try to be good stewards of local tax dollars. Taxes and education are volatile subjects, however, and there is no pleasing everybody. Hard choices have to be made, and someone will always be unhappy. School directors also are unpaid volunteers by definition in the commonwealth, and by statute only may be reimbursed for a few legitimate expenses.
Many of my colleagues on our board over the years refused even reimbursement. That’s because the folks on most boards serve in order to do right by the kids and the community. I say that even of the ones I don’t particularly like and with whom I may heartily disagree. Nobody with any sense runs for school board to get rich, and those with an ax to grind seldom last very long: It ends up being a whole lot of squeeze for precious little juice. It’s hard work and a thankless task, and the decisions involved often provoke heated emotions.
Please keep that in mind when you rebuke board directors, even if you feel you must. 
When you are first elected to a school board, it often takes a year or two to really get your head around how things work and how schools are funded and build their budgets. Then, you realize that, considering federal and state mandates, the realities of educational funding in Pennsylvania, the needs of children in your community, and the perspectives of taxpayers, boards often have quite a bit less latitude to act than it seems from the outside. 
Plus, a majority of the nine-person board has to vote in favor of whatever the decision is, and all decisions are —quite rightly — entirely public, except for parts of certain very limited personnel or student issues. The public aspect is crucial, and I am very much in favor of the Sunshine Act. I simply mention it because it is a reality of the position of school director that one becomes something of a local lightning rod. It can get ugly and personal, and not everyone is suited to the position for those reasons.  It’s also very hard to make positive changes, and one generally has to take the long view and work incrementally.

That said, it’s relatively easy to mess things up in a hurry.
There has been quite a lot in the news recently about the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education, and what the impact of the demise of that entity might mean to Pennsylvania students. The Department of Education is an easy target, because many folks chafe at the fact that it provides a lot of regulation but relatively little funding, although the funding it does distribute to less affluent districts is in fact quite significant and vital.
Just because the agency is being downsized, however, doesn’t mean federal education laws will disappear. We still have obligations to children living in poverty and children with special needs that are not going to magically go away, and they carry the weight of the law. One of the stated reasons for getting rid of oversight at the Federal level is to “shift more power over education to the states” and communities. 
School boards thus will have less guidance, but more responsibility.
So this year, your primary ballot means more than ever. Educate yourself, and then vote to support education in Pennsylvania. Examples abound of communities that ignored school board elections only to find themselves saddled with a board that was out of touch with taxpayers.
Your vote counts. Cast it for the candidates of your choice 
Tuesday, May 20, is the primary. Polls are open on election day from 7 in the morning until 8 in the evening. The last day to register to vote is May 5, and the last day to request a mail-in or absentee ballot is May 13.

Court challenges are being raised, but some are planning to return to their hazardous homelands, advocates said.
Since early 2023, about 900,000 came to the United States in the way that many Americans say they want: They followed the rules and they got in line. Then the Trump administration abruptly changed those rules.
Amid heavy numbers of border crossings, the Biden administration in January 2023 launched the CBP One app. It allowed people seeking asylum to register outside the country, wait to be admitted, receive work permits and then wait some more while their asylum claims were heard. 
But the Department of Homeland Security last week notified many CBP One users that they had to leave the country “immediately,” but it didn’t specify how many received such notices. Many have been told they need be gone by April 24.
The administration stopped taking new registrations through the app as soon as Trump took office in January.
The administration is also trying to revoke the temporary protected status of hundreds of thousands of migrants from 17 troubled countries. And on Thursday, the New York Times reported that it was trying to take Social Security numbers away from migrants with legal status. The goal is to get them to “self deport” by denying access to basic services such as bank accounts and credit cards, the paper reported.
The moves are said to be part of a flood-the-zone strategy that has immigrant advocates scrambling.
Fleeing oppression
Christy Staats, an Ohio-based organizer with the National Immigration Forum, estimated that thousands in the Buckeye State are affected by the CBP One revocation in all regions — including Amish country. She said a Nicaraguan family living in a rural part of Ohio called her in a panic.
Staats didn’t name the family or say where they lived for fear of arousing the government’s attention. She said that as of Thursday, the family was planning to go back to Nicaragua.
“They bought a car here,” Staats said. “They spent all this time waiting and not working until they got their work permit. They’re working. They’re paying taxes and all of the sudden their legal status gets ripped out from under them. It’s been really, really unsettling.”
That’s especially true given the reason the family sought asylum in the first place. 
The longstanding socialist government of Nicaragua has become increasingly oppressive in recent years. The U.S. State Department reported that in 2023 it engaged in “arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by prison guards and parapolice; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detentions; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; political prisoners… “
It added that the Ortega government imposed “serious restrictions on free expression and media freedom, including threats of violence against journalists, unjustified arrests and prosecution of journalists, and censorship; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association…”
That could be a particular problem for the family Staats has been working with.
“They played by the rules,” she said. “They got in line. Nicaragua has been in a very concerning state for quite a few years with their communist dictator restricting more and more freedoms. They had a couple of run-ins related to free speech. The government was watching them. The husband was pulled in by the police. They were very concerned that something more significant would happen. They’ve been jailing journalists like crazy for quite a few years.”
Confusing limbo
Adding to the uncertainty, the Associated Press reported late Thursday that a federal judge in Boston would at least temporarily stop Trump from ending the humanitarian paroles of people from Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.
Meanwhile, people from other countries who received humanitarian parole through the CBP One app were getting vague and threatening letters from the government. 
Erin Piper of Detroit has been working for years to get the extended family of friends she made through her children out of Afghanistan. On Friday morning, she said some received letters the previous evening that said “Do not attempt to stay in the United States — the federal government will find you.”
If the goal was to frighten them, it succeeded, Piper said.
“My friends are all having difficulty reaching their attorneys (who are likely being flooded with calls) to understand if their asylum cases are enough to keep them here without fear of deportation, but they are all incredibly scared,” Piper said in a text message. “The letter they received has only raised more questions.”
In an interview on Thursday, Piper said that the 21 Afghans she’s helped have known too much fear as it is. 
In 2020, the United States pulled troops out of Afghanistan, leaving the fanatical Taliban in charge. The group is well known for its extreme repression of women and girls, ethnic minorities and anybody who worked with the American armed forces during their 20-year presence in the country.
“Profoundly grateful”
Piper’s kids befriended those of an Afghan family who had immigrated to Michigan before the withdrawal. When Kabul fell, she learned that their extended family was in extreme distress back in Afghanistan.
For two years she worked with a non-governmental organization to get them visas, first to Pakistan, and then to Brazil.
“It was a really huge effort, logistically and financially,” Piper said. “I was supported a lot by my own local church and a Christian organization. I worked with a military veteran who helped us do a very successful fundraiser with a corporate sponsor. It was definitely a herculean effort logistically, financially and in many other ways.”
It was hard to find work in Brazil, so the extended family made its way through the deadly Darien Gap and made the rest of the harrowing trip through Central America and Mexico. Once there, they got in line using the CBP One app.
After getting to Michigan and getting work permits, the adults took unfilled factory jobs, and the kids went to school and learned English. A teenage girl is going to high school — something the Taliban would never allow.
“They’re barely scraping by,” Piper said. “But they’re here and thrilled to be here without the fear of persecution because of their ethnicity or their support for democracy. The women have equal rights here. Some have been able to work and support their families. That’s been really exciting for them. Their lives are far from easy, but they’re profoundly grateful to be here.”
Staats of the National Immigration Forum said there’s something deeply unjust in suddenly telling people who came legally that they have to go back to places they fled.
“A lot of Americans want people to play by the rules,” she said. “I’ve heard 10,000 times, ‘I want people to get in line. They should have to wait for their turn.’ They did. They waited in line until they got their turn. This program was telling asylum seekers not to just come to the border. So they waited — some for a long time. They had a credible-fear interview when they came in at their allocated time.”
“And now their status is being revoked very suddenly,” Staats said. “Anybody who wants an immigration system where we know who people are when they come in should be very concerned.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The increasing political divide is weaving itself into how to best sustain public forests and maximize their contribution to society.
Recent calls to significantly reduce or halt all timber harvesting — as well as others to radically open more acres for harvesting on public lands — frame our choice as either 1) save forests by eliminating human use or 2) embrace extraction that solely serves economic gain. This is a false choice.
Many options lie between these two extremes, including the one the Northern Forest Center believes is best: Public forests in our region can be managed to remain healthy and productive carbon sinks and habitats, while also providing wood we need for our daily lives.
Here in the Northeast, some invoke climate change to justify halting forestry and forest product production. This is a shortsighted and ultimately counterproductive call that undermines holistic environmental sustainability. This flawed, over-simplified strategy fails to consider the strong forest management on public lands in this region, the global impacts of resource consumption, and the environmental consequences of shifting demand to alternative materials and other places.
If not wood, what?
Our current reliance on materials derived from fossil fuels is profoundly impacting the planet. We know the production, transportation, and use of plastics, steel, and concrete contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and resource depletion. And produce lots of trash.
When steel, concrete, heating oil, and plastic came on the scene, they quickly overshadowed the time-tested, wood-based alternatives in our backyard. Compared to other materials, wood stands out for its superior environmental credentials. Unlike fossil-derived materials, wood is renewable and biodegradable. And trees offer invaluable climate benefits including absorbing and storing carbon — benefits that persist in durable products even after wood is harvested. Wood is naturally a part of a more circular ecological system; fossil fuel is not.
Across northern New England, we produce more than 289,000 tons of plastic waste annually. If we replaced just 10% of that packaging with wood-based, molded-fiber packaging, we would reduce that waste by an equivalent of more than 100 Statues of Liberty. And if we shifted just 10% of our construction materials from concrete and steel to wood, we could save approximately 65 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually — comparable to the annual emissions from over 13 million cars.
At present, Americans consume 1,095 pounds of wood per year. The reality is that global demand for wood products is increasing, not decreasing — and this reality presents a need and an opportunity. Recycling and reduced consumption must also be part of the answer, but the reality is there is no way to supply our huge daily demand for wood products without harvesting trees. With models predicting a 37% increase in global wood demand by 2050, New England can be a sustainable and reliable source — from both public and private lands — to meet this need. If we do not continue to use forest products, our consumption of fossil-fuel products will grow exponentially.
Wood from away is not the solution
Suggesting that wood should “come from somewhere else” doesn’t equate to less tree cutting; it simply shifts the burden to other regions, often to places with weaker environmental regulations and worker protections. This is not a solution; it is a transfer of responsibility that yields no positive outcome for the environment and a loss for local economies and landowners. And there is the added environmental and economic impact of transporting the wood here. It’s a lose-lose-lose.
Instead, let’s follow the example of local food by celebrating and relying on local forests, well-managed by people working and living in this region. Forest management here at home can better supply regional wood demands while enhancing ecological and community resilience against climate change, promoting biodiversity, and nurturing cultural connections to the land. A recent study of wood sources and uses in New England, “Beyond the Illusion of Preservation,” provides data to prove this point.
The region is positioned to adapt to a new forest future. Let’s have a more productive conversation about our relationship to forests — both public and private. Public lands play an important role for society and should not be controlled by extreme views on management or use; they are increasingly more critical as we confront our past choices and consider how we reduce overall consumption with diverse and innovative uses of wood that enable us to reduce our reliance on concrete, steel, fuel oil, and plastics while maintaining a resilient forest landscape.
Let’s stop arguing about false choices. Let’s celebrate our public forests, the people who steward them, and the benefits of sustainable forestry. By choosing local wood products, we ensure the vitality of the forest, the people who depend on it, and generations to come.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/forestmanage-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 05:03:26.461108

The use of economic tariffs to promote fairer trade and better outcomes for workers, consumers and the environment is not a new or bad idea.
In a world in which some countries rely on slave labor and treat the earth’s air and water like a garbage dump, thoughtfully designed and implemented tariffs can be a useful policy option.
Unfortunately, President Trump has been doing no such thing. Instead, he’s imposing tariffs in a chaotic and likely unlawful way based on little more than his daily whims.
And the outcomes have been disastrous.
North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis is typical of the Republican politicians who could help but lack the guts to do so. He’s co-sponsored a bill rein in Trump, but as he well knows it has no chance. Once again, his mission is to seem rather than to be.
The bottom line: Trump’s half-baked tariffs are wreaking economic havoc for millions of Americans and lining the pockets of his billionaire pals. And so long as politicians like Senator Tillis continue to enable him, the chaos will continue.

Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside.
Pennsylvania State Police Col. Chris Paris identified the 38-year-old as Cody Balmer. Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Sunday afternoon that his office was preparing to file charges against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded police after entering the residence grounds and setting the fire with “homemade incendiary devices.” He was arrested Sunday afternoon shortly before the scheduled 4:30 p.m. news conference, police said.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” Bivens said “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”

  Governor Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania State Police provide an update on the act of arson that took place at the Governor’s Residence.
Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m. a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders. The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith. The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said. Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
 ‘Large and complex crime scene’

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI. Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case. While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said. Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chainlink fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds.

State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are collecting signatures in the hopes of trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Senate Bill 1 into law on March 28 which bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, set rules around classroom discussion, creates post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things.
“After waiting for another organization or body to take up the lead on a state referendum, it became clear that no one was stepping forward,” the S.B. 1 State Referendum website said. “It was also clear that efforts prior to the passage of S.B. 1 were going largely ignored by the legislators.”

S.B. 1, which affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, is set to take effect at the end of June. In the meantime, a referendum petition can be filed and the legislation would be paused. 
The next step is to get an initial written petition signed by 1,000 registered Ohio voters submitted to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who must verify the number of valid signatures within 10 business days of receiving the petition. After that, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost must certify if he believes the petition summary is a “fair and truthful statement” of the law. 
If those steps get approved, the signature gathering process can begin. The petitioners would need about 248,092 signatures — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. 
“A state referendum is our last opportunity to make our legislature know that we do not want to destroy higher education in Ohio,” according to the S.B. 1 referendum website. “We want to retain collective bargaining rights for faculty.”
The last referendum that passed in Ohio was when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law in 2011.

[…]","Photo by WEWS.A provision passed in the Ohio House’s budget that schools say will require them to go back to the voters more frequently to ask for money.
“I think this is the most consequential budget that I’ve been in, and this is now my 17th year in the General Assembly,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said. “It does more things, on more fronts, than any budget that I’ve ever had been involved in.”
Huffman and most of his Republican colleagues cheered the state passing its $60 billion 2-year budget, helping fund the new Browns stadium, but cutting millions of dollars from public libraries and schools.
Parma City Schools Superintendent Charles Smialek continues to break down the impact on public schools.
“We always talked about a slippery slope, and I think that the slope is covered in oil at this point,” Smialek said.
The superintendent has been speaking to me for months about his concerns now that the state is slashing hundreds of millions in expected public school funding, but he said another aspect of the budget bill will cause additional problems for districts.
“Schools are just sitting on a lot more money than they can spend,” Huffman said.
According to the House GOP, schools have carried over $10.5 billion, which should be going back to the residents. The bill would require counties to cut property tax rates, distributing back unspent cash, if school districts save more than 30% of the previous year’s budget.
“We simply looked at this as saying, ‘Here’s lots of money that isn’t being used and that can provide the property tax relief right now,'” the speaker continued.
Those reserves are essential, Smialek said, because they have to prepare for inflation and increasing costs for resources, energy and gas — plus pay raises for teachers and staff.
Parma’s current carryover rate is 26%, but the administrator added that they will need to go over if their levy fails this May.
“If we were at 32%, we had to give that money back — that’s going to make us come back and just ask for it back again from local taxpayers,” he said. “It really becomes almost a tug of war.”
If schools have larger reserves, that means voters don’t need to worry as much about levies.
“For us to have to give back a cash balance because there’s this perception that we’re hoarding cash just belies common sense,” he said.
Some districts worry about what happens when they are saving for larger projects — such as a move or a total renovation — and they need more than 30%. Huffman said that wouldn’t be an issue.
“Right now school districts can take money out of their operating fund and segregate it for those kinds of projects,” the speaker said, noting that there are capital funds.
When moving money around, Smialek said that you can move operating funds to capital, but you can’t move it back. Giving an example, he said that if someone is building a new school, they can anticipate a certain number of increase in enrollment or teachers — but there is never a for sure.
“You want to be able to budget for that, you want to be able to afford that,” he said. “You don’t want to have to wait until that year and go out to your, community and say, ‘Oh my gosh, we knew this was coming, but we weren’t able to carry the cash over, we weren’t able to have the savings, and so now we need more money from you.'”
The Ohio Education Association reports that right now, about 80% of school districts will be impacted due to the 30% cutoff. This will continue a cycle of voters rejecting levies, on top of state spending cuts, Smialek said.
The result? Schools will be forced to cut jobs and classes.
“If we don’t have those funds, you continue to squeeze your labor force, you continue to make cuts that impact kids every day,” Smialek said.
The budget isn’t final, as it heads to the GOP-controlled Senate for review.

Ohio legislators are considering bills that would bar local governments from having a say in permitting projects that capture carbon dioxide emissions and inject them underground. The legislation could even force some landowners to let their property be used for carbon dioxide storage.
The framework proposed in the twin bills being considered by the state House and Senate starkly contrasts with Ohio’s approach to wind and solar farms, most of which can be blocked by counties.
Instead, carbon capture and storage projects would follow a process similar to what’s used for oil and gas drilling, in which property owners must allow development on or below their land if enough neighbors support it.
At least one large energy company, Tenaska, is already talking to Ohio landowners about obtaining rights to drill wells and store carbon dioxide from industrial and energy operations deep underground. An executive with the firm said the legislation would provide ​“clarity” for its planned carbon storage hub serving Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
“This project will provide manufacturers, industrial facilities, and other businesses in this region with a solution to address growing environmental regulations and climate goals,” said Ali Kairys, senior director of project development for Tenaska.
The company is in discussions with various carbon-emitting businesses, including steel refineries, ethanol plants, and power plants. The Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub could also be a potential customer, Kairys said.
In Ohio, Tenaska is eyeing Harrison, Jefferson, and Carroll counties as prime places to store CO2 underground. The three counties are among the state’s top oil and gas producers and have a history of coal mining. Tenaska initially hopes to store captured carbon dioxide in the Knox formation, which ranges from 8,500 feet to 12,000 feet below the Earth’s surface, Kairys said. Second-stage storage would use another formation roughly 5,500 to 8,000 feet underground.
Other carbon sequestration projects could be on the horizon. The Great Plains Institute has identified roughly three dozen industrial facilities across the state as candidates for carbon capture projects. And even though the Trump administration is relaxing the environmental regulations that may motivate such efforts, 45Q tax credits expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act incentivize companies nationwide to develop storage projects.
Ohio’s House Bill 170 and Senate Bill 136 would give the state Department of Natural Resources ​“sole and exclusive authority to regulate carbon sequestration,” a power the agency also has over oil and gas production via existing law. The Ohio Supreme Court has interpreted the oil and gas law’s language to block local government regulation of drilling, even through general zoning rules that apply to other businesses.
If passed, the bills would similarly deprive counties and townships of any say over sequestration, said Bev Reed, an organizer for the Buckeye Environmental Network. ​“It’s … another really tragic thing that the Legislature is forcing on us.”
The bills would also authorize a ​“consolidation” process that operators can undertake to force landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage in their property’s subsurface ​“pore space” if owners of 70% of the remaining area for an injection project have signed on. The process is similar to that for unitization, which lets oil and gas companies drill through dissenting landowners’ properties.
The chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ oil and gas management division would be required to grant consolidation if it was ​“reasonably necessary to facilitate the underground storage of carbon dioxide.” A landowner could only object on the grounds that the facility’s design threatens ​“a commercially valuable mineral,” such as oil, gas, or coal.
“You don’t get to object and say this is dangerous, this is ill-conceived or for any other reason,” said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law. ​“Reasonably necessary is a very low standard” for forcing property owners to give up the use of their pore space, she added.
Asked to respond to advocacy groups’ complaints that the process is unfair, Tenaska’s Kairys focused instead on landowners’ potential for income.


















“A [carbon capture and storage] project allows landowners to benefit from an untapped revenue stream — leasing pore space deep below the surface. This is a passive income stream that has little to no impact on the surface use of the land,” Kairys said. The bills’ structure for compensating landowners ​“mirrors existing state law for individuals being paid for their mineral rights,” she added.
The bills call for compensation, but it’s subject to adjustments for the developer’s expenses. Companies in oil and gas unitization cases often get to recoup twice their costs before they have to pay landowners more than the law’s minimum 12.5% royalty. Neither HB 170 nor SB 136 requires any minimum payment to landowners. Yet once carbon dioxide is stored underground, landowners presumably couldn’t use or drill through the storage formation.
The bills are currently in the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy Committee. Primary sponsors are all Republicans: Sen. Tim Schaffer, Sen. Brian Chavez, Rep. Bob Peterson, and Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel.
“Make no mistake, carbon capture storage technology is here,” Robb Blasdel testified before the House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday. ​“This General Assembly must act to ensure Ohioans’ rights are protected and their voices are heard.” More hearings are expected in coming weeks.
Critics have dozens of questions, including whether sequestration projects make economic sense and whether they will significantly reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
“It’s very expensive to retrofit [industrial] facilities to be able to capture the carbon — and very energy-intensive,” Reed said. The process may even cumulatively add carbon pollution to the atmosphere, after accounting for the emissions produced when capturing the CO2 and injecting it underground, she noted.
Other questions deal with feared drops in property values, chemicals used in the carbon sequestration process, and the huge amounts of water that carbon capture technologies require.
People also worry about the potential for carbon dioxide to escape from underground storage or related pipelines, said Randi Pokladnik, an environmental scientist and volunteer for Save Ohio Parks.
Tenaska’s project will include a detailed emergency response plan, Kairys said, adding that carbon dioxide is not flammable. ​“At extremely high concentrations, carbon dioxide temporarily displaces oxygen. However, carbon dioxide dissipates very, very quickly.”
Dozens of people were hospitalized in Satartia, Mississippi, in 2020 when a carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured. Another carbon dioxide pipeline leaked last year near Sulphur, Louisiana.
Companies have injected carbon dioxide underground for years to stimulate extra production from oil and gas wells, but it has never been done at the large scale proposed now, Pokladnik said. She worries that gas could migrate upward through fractures in overlying rock layers or other wells, including many old, abandoned oil wells whose locations may be unknown.
“We’re in a world where we don’t have any expertise,” Pokladnik said.

When do you call failure success?
When you have a supermajority of Republicans in the Kansas Legislature.
Whatever else you might have heard about the 2025 session, it was a disastrous bellyflop into a swimming pool full of curdled milk. Lawmakers wrapped up their work on Friday, leaving the state crueler, sicker, poorer and weaker. A bill mugging transgender kids made it into law. So did a bill promising tax cuts but threatening fiscal ruin. Public health officials’ power to fight illness was restricted. Special education students were left out to dry.
It was, as I just wrote, a nauseating catastrophe.
But it’s just what Republicans wanted. Boasting strengthened supermajorities in their respective chambers, House Speaker Dan Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson rode roughshod over Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly during the two-day veto session. Few backbench Republicans dared speak up or challenge leadership.
On the House side, members apparently met in secret nearly every day, giving and taking marching orders. Committees heard precious little actual debate. Bills speeded through and landed on the floor, where they passed with scant discussion. Meanwhile, the whole affair wrapped up in the middle of April, leaving little time for serious consideration or compromise.
You might expect Democrats to raise holy heck about this state of affairs, and some did. But others tried to model reasonableness, while their opponents modeled radicalism.
Since returning to Kansas in the summer of 2016, I’ve endured nine sessions of the Kansas Legislature. Never have I witnessed such a disconnect between what was actually achieved and what members believed they had done. Republican lawmakers gloried in their wins.
Everyone else was left in their dust, fearing what might come next.

Schwab roasts Masterson
You could witness a hint of unrest, however, in Secretary of State Scott Schwab‘s emergent campaign for governor.
The Republican announced early this year, and he could well face Masterson in the Republican primary. He blasted out a press release Friday that should leave the Senate president at least a bit concerned.
“Leadership repeatedly assured voters that cutting property taxes would be one of the first bills out of the chute in 2025,” the release reads. “Kansans would receive a reprieve, and taxes would be kept in check. But when it came time to lead, both the governor and leadership came up short. Instead of giving Kansans a break, they gave them a bill backed by Senate leadership. The result? A paltry $25.88 tax break signed by the governor for someone owning a $150,000 home. Not enough to fill the gas tank or have the lawn mowed, let alone make life more affordable for families or seniors on fixed incomes.”
Let the man cook.
He continued, later in the release: “Kansans expected better. Kansans expected leadership that would address runaway property tax increases, arrest out-of-control valuations, and restore confidence that they can afford the homes they live in — not rent them from the government.”

Final batch of questions
I’ve started asking questions aplenty in my Statehouse scraps columns this year, both for my own amusement and to cover further ground. Here’s what came to mind over veto session.

Have Republicans finally lost their fear of being blamed for a Gov. Sam Brownback-styled fiscal disaster? Or have they just forgotten?
After all the drama surrounding Rep. Ford Carr’s disciplinary hearings, isn’t it interesting how the whole situation seemed to fade away once the panel had to settle on doing something?
Will Statehouse Democrats recalibrate before next session? If they have so little legislative power, what do they have to lose by attacking Republicans with a bit more glee?
Will Kelly call a special session of April revenue estimates come in under expectations? How much with leadership bellyache if she does so?
How on earth could next session be worse than this one? I ask a version of this question every year, and the Legislature seldom disappoints me. Still, how?

Secret secrets
Hawkins never allowed journalists back into the press box on the House floor. Despite our coverage, and despite the many reporters just doing their jobs at the Statehouse, the speaker decided to put his animus toward facts ahead of serving the public.
Over in the Senate, Masterson continued a similar policy unfurled in 2022. More than three years on, he appears to have paid no price for limiting access.
Meanwhile, House Republicans met secretly. Reporters were ejected from caucus meetings on multiple occasions, all for the simple act of trying to inform members of the public about what their representatives were doing.
You might like what the 2025 Kansas Legislature did. You might, as I do, detest it.
At the very least, lawmakers and their leaders should have the courage to do it in the sunlight.
With this column, Statehouse scraps wraps its 2025 run. It will resume when the Kansas Legislature does, in January 2026.

The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
Trump’s mass deportation plan could rely on state cooperation

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

Jim Pillen and some Nebraska legislative leaders seem poised to make it harder to use SNAP benefits to buy candy and pop. (Stock photo by Johner Images/Getty Images)Gov. Jim Pillen and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services CEO, Dr. Steve Corsi, are on the record that soda pop and candy are sugar highs that over time can lead to serious health-related lows. Good call. 
A letter of intent from the governor to the USDA asserts the state’s want to join a number of other states who ban SNAP recipients from using their benefits for pop and candy. Nice: Now do everybody else. 
That’s because the Pillen/Corsi argument is that pop and candy are unhealthy, especially for children. No one is claiming otherwise, plus the scientists have the receipts to back it up. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that adult obesity continues to rise. Its latest numbers, reported in the fall of 2024, showed that 35% of adults in 23 states had obesity, including Nebraska at 36.6%. A decade earlier no state was above that threshold. 
Childhood obesity
Among children the obesity rate has risen to nearly one in five kids dealing with the consequences of unhealthy weight. According to the CDC, the cost of childhood obesity checks in at $1.3 billion. 
Diabetes among children has reached historic numbers, too. According to research published in the “Journal of Diabetes,” Type 2 diabetes in children aged 10-19 has doubled in the past decade, and Type 1 Diabetes has grown from 20 to 22 children per 100,000.
Although diabetes and obesity are disproportionately higher in low-income communities, no one on the poverty-to-wealth continuum is immune from the persistence of both maladies. Restricting SNAP beneficiaries may address one particular income group, but if pop and sugar are bad for poor kids, they are bad for rich ones, too.
Others have tried
Several attempts at previous nutritional causes and movements have been met with fierce and forceful pushback, accompanied by fevered charges of nanny-state overreach.
In 2012, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed banning sugary drinks over 16 ounces in the Big Apple. Yes, hell did break loose. No, the ban never went into effect. 
The nation’s soft drink industry eventually prevailed in the New York Supreme Court, which ruled the city’s Board of Health, which pushed Bloomberg’s idea, failed to stay in its lane. To wit: New Yorkers, like the rest of us, can still supersize their sweet drinks.
In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama launched “Let’s Move,” a program to offset the march of childhood obesity in America. In addition to encouraging exercise, Obama also worked with Congress to lower the level of fats, calories, salt, sugar and sodium and increase the amount of fruits and veggies students found in the school cafeteria line. You would have thought she slipped state secrets to our adversaries. The pushback was intense and personal from talk radio to the blogosphere, including a Fox News contributor who argued that Obama needed to “drop a few pounds” before trafficking in nutritional advice. 
Sadly, such bilge still passes for argument today.
Eventually, Congress passed a law that allowed schools to opt out of the healthier standards because what’s a good idea — helping kids eat healthier — without a way to get around it. 
Taxpayer funds
Sure, taxpayers foot the food bill for SNAP recipients, but we also pay the federal freight for scores of others who benefit from government largess. What would be the reaction if we required all those with tax breaks or direct subsidies from the feds not to not use said benefits for jelly beans, Dr. Pepper, et al? 
While Nebraska’s letter of intent may be in line with a national focus coming in part from federal health officials, taking cues from Washington may not always be in the state’s best interest, a lesson perhaps learned in the recent “blue dot” vote in the Nebraska Legislature.
Finally, if we’re talking about getting healthy food to children, we should also be discussing the prevalence of food deserts in the state. Food deserts are generally defined as areas where access to “affordable, healthy food options (especially fresh fruits and vegetables) is restricted or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance.” 
Instead, residents in these areas often end up buying food designed for a longer shelf life and all too often filled with sugar and other preservatives.
Although often associated with urban areas, food deserts, according to the Center for Rural Affairs, can be found in 11 Nebraska counties: Blaine, Custer, Duel, Dundy, Grant, Hitchcock, Hooker, Jefferson, Keya Paha, Morrill and Sioux.
Yes, let’s talk about nutritious food for kids. But if we want an even healthier Nebraska, don’t stop with SNAP.

Image by Midjourney AIYoung adults across Georgia will soon be passing that major milestone: walking across the stage, taking their diplomas in hand and basking in the applause after their names are read.
Most friends and family members cheering from the stands won’t give the person behind the voice a second thought, but in some Georgia colleges, there may be more to those announcers than meets the ear, and some rising graduates say they’re not happy about it.
At least three universities in the state have reported using services that incorporate artificial intelligence to read the names of students preparing to turn over their tassels, including the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech and Kennesaw State University.
Tassel, the company these universities use, boasts a database with phonetic pronunciation components for over 100,000 names, according to its website. The software is trained on thousands of previously recorded names from voice artists, which Tassel says results in a natural and authentic reading with a lower chance of flubs or mispronunciations.
UGA communications director James Hataway said the university uses Tassel’s services for graduate commencement ceremonies – individual student names are not read at undergraduate commencements – and that it also allows students to create personalized graduation slides for the program.
“UGA has coordinated with this company and its predecessor–Marching Order–since 2020, and it has been a great benefit to the flow of the commencement ceremony,” he said.
Graduates at schools that use Tassel get the opportunity to review the pronunciation of their name before the ceremony, and if the system can’t get it right, they can record the name and send it to the company to ensure it is pronounced correctly.
“We now utilize AI to generate names when possible,” according to a company FAQ. “The synthetic voices are based on real voice artists, who will still be engaged to create new recordings if a graduate’s name is not pronounced to their satisfaction at first.”
Some Georgia students say the thought of an AI generated voice reading out their name on their big day seems wrong.
An online petition at Change.org urging the University of North Georgia not to use the software for its upcoming commencement ceremonies has garnered more than 1,800 signatures.
“Graduation is so much more than just another school event to set up and take down within a week,” the petition reads. “It is a celebration of each student’s success, a reflection of how much they have grown, and the ultimate payoff for their hard work. What UNG plans to do does not represent how a university should handle recognizing their graduating students as they advance to the next chapters of their lives.”
Petition signers echoed those sentiments, and some called it hypocrisy for the university to use AI in this way while taking a hard line against its use by students.
The school made headlines last year after a student was put on probation after a teacher accused her of using AI to write a class paper. The student said she wrote the paper herself and only used software to check her spelling, grammar and punctuation.
UNG communications director Clark Leonard said the school hopes the new technology will make the ceremony more special for students.
“Our focus is never on any one element in isolation — it’s about the full experience and finding thoughtful ways to make this special day even more personal, inclusive, and celebratory for every graduate,” he said. “For example, this technology allows us to synchronize each graduate’s name with video board displays, on-screen captions, and the announcement itself, creating a more consistent, accessible and respectful moment for every student crossing the stage.”
Georgia State University professor Arun Rai, co-founder and director of the university’s Center for Digital Innovation and a member of the Georgia Technology Authority’s AI Advisory Council, said as artificial intelligence technology improves, we should expect to see it integrate more and more into established traditions like graduations.
When it’s used correctly, he said, it can help solve logistical or accessibility challenges like making sure names are pronounced correctly and integrating with on-screen captions or other assistive technologies..
“That said, I understand why students might feel slighted or worry that an AI voice removes the personal connection they’ve looked forward to — especially on a day as emotionally significant as graduation,” he said. “Hearing your name read aloud by another human being who shares your sense of pride can feel more meaningful and communal. It’s not just about the words, but the tone of voice, the excitement, and the sense that a fellow person is celebrating right along with you.”
Rai said universities should seek to strike a balance between tradition and innovation and welcome student feedback .
“I’d reassure students that their university experience—and the relationships they’ve built—shouldn’t be overshadowed by this single use of AI,” he said. “At the same time, it’s completely fair for them to expect a ceremony that feels personal and special. If there’s been a communication gap or if students believe the focus on efficiency is overriding tradition, it’s worth raising those concerns, as they’re doing.”
“Ultimately, commencement should recognize the human stories of resilience, achievement, and growth—an AI tool is only helpful if it respects and enhances that experience,” he added.

For the first time since the post-2020 presidential election, Georgia Republican state lawmakers did not pass a bill during this year’s session that included controversial changes to the way votes are cast or tallied.
When Lt. Gov. Burt Jones sent senators home a little after 9 p.m. on April 4, it not only seemed to catch many senators off guard, but it also briefly left the House in disarray. The abrupt ending likely killed the main election bill’s chances in 2025, raising questions about what new rules could be in place in time for the 2026 election year highlighted by races for governor, U.S. Senate, attorney general and all 236 state legislative races.
The most significant GOP election bill for the session was among the dozens of bills left in limbo. It will still be active when lawmakers return for the second half of the two-year legislative cycle next January.
The House adjourned before legislators were presented with a substitute version of House Bill 397 that cleared the Senate after the addition of several proposals such as expanding State Election Board powers and banning Georgia from participation in a multi-state voter rolls data sharing partnership. Instead, the House passed a resolution on the last day of the 2025 Legislature creating a study committee that will examine election rules later this year.
The 2026 legislative session will begin with the House retaining control over SB 397 and Senate Bill 214, which would give voters the option of filling out ballots with pencils or pens instead of using electronic voting machine touchscreens when they cast votes at polling stations.
The possibility of a switch to hand-marked paper ballots will be a topic later this year after House legislators created a study committee to review Georgia’s Dominion Voting System’s touchscreen system.
The Coalition for Good Governance is warning legislators they shouldn’t take further action to remove QR codes from being used in paper ballot tabulation.
“County election officials are now trapped,” coalition executive director Marilyn Marks said. “They are legally prohibited from using QR codes after July 1, 2026 — but given no money or direction from the state on how to comply — a tab that could be more than $70 million according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Any attempt to install new hardware and software would need to begin in early 2026, and funding and acquisition of equipment would be required this year.”
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns led the Republican members of the committee to defer any consideration of hand-marked paper ballots until 2029. Burns has said the study committee this fall will begin planning out the transition to human readable text for paper ballots.
The transition has been deferred from QR codes to  human readable text for paper ballots.
The possibility of a switch to hand-marked paper ballots will be a topic later this year after House legislators created a study committee to review Georgia’s Dominion Voting System’s touchscreen system.
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns sponsored SB 214, which would allow voters to request ballots similar to absentee ballots when they visit a polling place during early voting or on an Election Day.
Leading up to Sine Die, the Coalition for Good Governance warned legislators against not taking further action to remove QR codes from being used in paper ballot tabulation.
“County election officials are now trapped,” coalition executive director Marilyn Marks wrote in a newsletter email. “They are legally prohibited from using QR codes after July 1, 2026 — but given no money or direction from the state on how to comply — a tab that could be more than $70 million according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Any attempt to install new hardware and software would need to begin in early 2026, and funding and acquisition of equipment would be required this year.”
Raffensperger has asked for legislators to implement a much less expensive software update instead of removing QR codes from ballots.
The Georgia Republican Party and right-wing election watchdog groups like VoterGa have pushed for state election changes that will give the controversial State Election Board more autonomy over election rulemaking and administrative independence from the secretary of state’s office. Three of the five board members are staunchly  loyal to President Donald Trump.
Democratic lawmakers have objected to HB 397’s provision banning voters from dropping off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day. Critics have also raised concerns about expanded election board rulemaking powers despite the bill proposing to prohibit rulemaking within 60 days of an election.
Another contested section of the bill is over the plan for the state to transition from participating in the Electronic Registration Information Center, an organization that currently provides two dozen states a database to help maintain accurate voter rolls.
“They claim the rolls are littered with the names of people who have moved from the addresses on their registrations and are no longer eligible to vote, but ignore that the evidence they point to is often insufficient under our laws to trigger removal of voters from rolls,” Atlanta Democratic Rep. Saira Draper wrote as the legislative session was down.
There will be a condensed window for next year for legislators passing new election rules that could be implemented in the time for a 2026 election cycle that begins with primaries in May.
Draper has been outspoken about her being dismayed by the recent majority GOP legislature passing election legislation to “assuage election denier concerns.
“We must always push back on narratives based on misinformation and fear-mongering,” she said.
The State Election Board is set to meet Monday to hire a new executive director

Sen. Bernie Sanders brought his “Fight Oligarchy” tour to deep-red Utah on Sunday, delivering a fiery speech that went after President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, other billionaires, corporations, and the top 1%. 
During Sanders’ speech, shouts of “eat the rich” and “tax the rich” were repeatedly tossed out from a crowd that nearly filled the Jon M. Huntsman Center stadium at the University of Utah’s campus in Salt Lake City. Though Utah is a Republican-controlled state, its capital of Salt Lake City is a democratic stronghold — and there, frustrated Utah Democrats turned out in troves. 
Sanders’ team estimated 20,000 attended. The arena has a roughly 15,000-seat capacity, according to the university. An estimated 1,000 more packed the arena floor, and about 4,000 crowded outside the arena, according to Sanders’ team. 
Sanders, alongside another one of the country’s leading progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, urged Utahns and Americans to stand up against what they described as a democracy falling victim to corporate interests and greed — as well as politics that are dividing working-class Americans rather than uniting them. 
“We do not want a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class,” Sanders said to ear-splitting cheers that at times drowned out his voice. “We want a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%.”

‘Dangerous moment’ of billionaire control
Sanders delivered a similar line to the one that made headlines from his speech one day earlier, in Los Angeles, where he told a crowd of 36,000 — his biggest yet, according to his team — that America is facing a “dangerous” time. He accused Trump of moving the country “rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society,” the L.A. Times reported. 
“We are living in the most dangerous moment in modern history of this country. … We are living in a moment where a handful of billionaires control our government,” he told the Salt Lake City crowd, which responded with booming boos. 
Ocasio-Cortez said “this moment didn’t come out of nowhere.”
“It has been a long time coming,” she said. “The destruction of our rights and democracy is directly tied to the growing and extreme wealth inequality that has been building in America for years.”

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez also urged Utahns and Americans alike to demand change to the nation’s campaign finance laws, which they said have enabled the wealthy to control Washington, D.C. for too long.  
At one point, Sanders, an independent, went after the party he caucuses with, saying “corruption exists” not just with Republicans, but “in the Democratic party as well.”
“For too many years Democrats have not had the courage to take on powerful special interests,” he said. 
While urging Utahns to turn their ire against billionaires and corporations — especially when it comes to pharmaceutical companies and the health care system — Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez both also urged progressives to resist “hate” and work to find common ground with their fellow Americans, rather than fall into political “traps” that divide them. 
“This movement isn’t about partisan labels or purity tests,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But it is about class solidarity.” 
“I do know that 99% is a larger number than 1%,” Sanders said. “If we stand together and not let them divide us up by the color of our skin, or where we were born, or sexual orientation —  if we stand together, we can defeat Trumpism and defeat the authoritarians and the oligarchy.”

What is the ‘Fight Oligarchy’ tour?
Utah was one stop of many on Sanders’ tour out West for his Fight Oligarchy tour, which his website described as an effort to “have real discussions across America on how we move forward to take on the Oligarchs and corporate interests who have so much power and influence in this country.” 
Sanders’ visit to Salt Lake City came the day after he also made a surprise appearance at the star-studded Coachella music festival in California, where he told young Americans “the future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation,” CBS News reported. 
Though Sanders drew a big crowd in Los Angeles, Politico reported his progressive movement is “on its heels,” describing California — the biggest state that Sanders won during his failed presidential bid in 2020 — as “more like the wilderness than the promised land.” The outlet noted that progressive efforts in even deep blue California to enact single-payer health care and other policies have “fizzled,” with prominent Democrats including Gov. Gavin Newsom leaning center. 
“In the nation’s blue bastion of California, the influence of progressivism during the Trump era has waned,” Politico reported. “Progressive priorities are being challenged not just by conservatives, but centrists who cast the left as contributing to problems around homelessness and crime. And Democrats in California now find themselves merely trying to hold onto gains they have made amid major threats to federal funding from President Donald Trump, an escalation of deportations and aggressive rhetoric on crime.”

Beyond Sanders’ win of the 2020 California Democratic presidential primary, Democrats at the time didn’t embrace him for their presidential nominee, going instead with former President Joe Biden, who successfully beat Trump that year. 
Still, Sanders is one of the most prominent progressive faces in American politics today. Over his decades in the political arena, Sanders has gone from a party outsider and democratic socialist to a front-line act in the progressive movement. He is the longest-serving registered independent in the U.S. Congress, but he caucuses with the Democrats. 
He and Ocasio-Cortez, headlined the tour, which embraced populism from a progressive lens. While Trump employed populist rhetoric against Washington D.C. “elites,” Sanders and AOC’s tour took aim at the influence of billionaires and corporations in American politics — in particular Trump and Elon Musk’s foray into controlling federal spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 
The “Fight Oligarchy” tour comes as the Democrats look to find a foothold in a bleak political landscape, fresh off the heels of a blistering loss during the 2024 election that saw Trump recapture the White House as Republicans swept up control of the House and Senate. 
In wake of those losses, the Democratic Party’s popularity has also hit an all-time low, according to an NBC poll last month, with just 27% of registered voters saying they have positive views of the party.

Utah Democrats join rally 
Several prominent Utah Democrats attended Sunday’s rally, including Caroline Gleich, who last year unsuccessfully ran to represent Utah in the U.S. Senate. She lost to Sen. John Curtis, a Republican.
Beaming at the crowd, Gleich said she got “chills” from the turnout. 
“This is Utah rising,” she said. “Utah is about to become the battleground state of the future.” 
Gleich and state Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Salt Lake City, urged Utah progressives to not get discouraged by their state’s Republican-dominated politics. 
Blouin delivered fiery opening remarks, saying that what he’s always liked about Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is “they know how to stand up to bullies.” 
“Here in Utah, we know a thing or two about bullies,” he said, to loud cheers. He went on to accuse Gov. Spencer Cox of being a “cowardly governor trying to bully us into being nicer,” and he said the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature has a “habit of bullying refugees and immigrants.” 
Other elected Salt Lake City Democrats joined the crowd, including House Minority Leader Angela Romero and Rep. Ashlee Matthews. As Sanders exited the stage, he stopped to greet both of the women, while Romero held Matthews’ baby son, Joey Matthews, in her arms.

Much of Sanders’ and Ocasio-Cortez’s message focused on young Americans. Vasey Payne, 18, a senior at East High School in Salt Lake City, came to the rally, saying she was initially surprised to learn that Sanders would bring his tour to conservative Utah, but she was encouraged by the thousands of like-minded Utahns who showed up. 
Payne said she’s a registered Democrat, though she added that sometimes she doesn’t fully align with the party itself, saying she sees herself as “very far left just because of the way our government has been pushing further right.” 
“I don’t know, in 2025, somehow empathy has become a radical take,” she said. “I just tend to believe that people should be able to do what they want without fear … and be able to afford housing and health care and food. Which for some reason makes me a radical.” 
Not everyone who attended was a Democrat. A Republican, Lea Vanderlin, 33, came from Ogden to the rally dressed in a Lady Liberty costume. She said under Trump, “it feels like liberty is not for all but for some.” 
“So I’m here to resist,” she said. 
Vanderlin said Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez’s message should resonate with all working-class Americans — regardless of whether they’re conservative or liberal. She said she’s a registered Republican, but tries to vote for “moderates.” 
To her, America’s “wealth gap” is a time bomb. If it’s not defused, it could spell disaster. 
“Every major empire has fallen because the middle class has thinned,” she said. “That’s something everybody should be worried about. It’s a road map for trouble.”

As you and your baby are getting ready to leave the hospital after birth, a mini crash course on all things from how to change a diaper to how to feed a baby is taught. But what is not brought up is the very high likelihood that your healthy baby may be hospitalized if exposed to respiratory syncytial virus, better known as RSV.
According to the CDC, RSV is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S. It’s estimated that 58,000-80,000 children younger than five years old are hospitalized each year due to RSV. What’s so scary about RSV is that babies and kids are dying from this virus. Something as simple as a runny nose and cough can turn lethal in hours. Approximately 100-300 deaths occur each year in children younger than five. These statistics are unnerving and only continuing to rise.

Sophia Bochenek
Infants depend on their caregivers to keep them safe. Starting in 2023, The RSV vaccine has been available for infants being born into or during the RSV season. The vaccine has changed the way prevention against RSV has looked in the past two years. So how effective is the vaccine? The vaccine was 90% effective in preventing infants from being hospitalized with RSV. Like any illness, the severity of RSV can range from mild to severe but receiving the vaccine drastically reduces the likelihood of experiencing severe symptoms.
 With cases spreading at rates higher than ever before, RSV is getting more attention in both the media and the medical field. The RSV pathogen is increasing in society, specifically over the past 10-20 years. As social distancing and quarantines have seemed to slow down since the pandemic and more in person interaction has resumed, the spread of germs has run ramped. Simple things like handwashing and covering a cough once again have taken a seat on the back burner.
RSV sets itself apart from the common cold. What makes RSV so dangerous to infants is that RSV specifically affects the way babies breathe, putting their health in jeopardy. Babies have an immature immune system that has little exposure to outside pathogens. The virus can lead to decreased feeding, dehydration, and most severe, ineffective breathing. Infants are considered to be a fragile population as they aren’t able to advocate for themselves and they also are immunocompromised. As the caregiver, it’s crucial to look for early warning signs of illness and get medical care as soon as possible.
Although we can’t control what others chose to do about handwashing and social distancing, we can decide to protect our infants with vaccination. To think that one vaccine can cut the chances of being hospitalized with a virus down by 90% seems like a no-brainer. Having an extra line of defense against the virus gives parents an extra sense of security. 
With so many things to worry about as a parent, don’t let RSV be another item on the list.

Connecticut is at the end of the line for all sources of imported energy, and we do not have coal, oil or gas locally to tap into. Deregulation was thought to have been an improvement to our high prices many years ago but has turned out to be a failure for the paying public.
Deregulation has been good for the aggregators that replaced Enron, charging nine to 11 cents when they buy from gas plants at three cents. Tariffs on Canadian electricity will drive up costs as well. Why couldn’t the state or Eversource contract directly from the plants to purchase power on our behalf, leaving out the middleman? The Connecticut Business and Industry Association has done this at significant savings for some members, and with a much longer fixed-price period.

Chip Beckett
Eversource is judged on local distribution, not controlling the cost of supply, transmission and public benefits. Individually we can affect our supply costs and transmission. Public benefits are deemed important, and whether paid by tax dollars or ratepayers, the costs are unlikely to change as most is fixed-price supply from the Millstone nuclear power plant which saved us a lot in previous years.
Local sources also eliminate or decrease demand charges when the weather is extreme, also allowing for required transmitted power to be less than currently needed. Transmission being lessened or even eliminated saves us money individually and collectively. We still need transmission capabilities to move things around, but minimizing its use saves us money.
We only have two energy sources readily available to Connecticut: sun and wind. We, the public should work to offset our own use as well as the commercial/industrial uses that are locally controlled. I do not think everyone can add their own electricity, but many more homes could, as a positive long-term investment, just like a new roof does. 
While funds are tied up for this investment, solar arrays lock in the price for 20-25 years while electric prices regularly rise with no end in sight. Can everyone afford this? No, but many more could with the proper incentives and regulatory guidance. Homegrown energy at your home or business will minimize your individual burden.
Onshore wind on a small scale may also be effective. I regularly see the windmill in New Haven off the side of the bridge, spinning and making electricity for the plant owner. We have wind on our shore and hilltops. Couldn’t we have a local distribution system capable of accepting and moving around locally produced electricity as a matter of right rather than regulatory review that can be years long? 
It would minimize imported power coming on transmission lines and add to supply. Can Eversource and United Illuminating install distributed batteries so the local grid can accept power peaks and valleys from distributed generation? Solar can be expanded on more roofs, but also parking lots as carports, shading cars from sun, rain and snow as well as producing electricity. 
Connecticut has miles of highway rights of way that other states utilize for panels, like Massachusetts. Can we encourage large buildings of factories and malls to utilize solar panels? Even if they don’t want to do it themselves, could the state and real estate owners rent the space to solar installers on a long term basis? It would save green field development in our farmland, forests and open spaces. 
Could PURA have the limits on home rooftop solar be dropped, so people can put as much as they want, instead of being limited to 102% of their estimated use?
Nuclear power has many advocates, but it would be at least 15 years before anything could come on line, so that will not help us in the short run. We need solutions that help now and the near future.
The final note would be that gas plants are around but can run out in cold snaps — probably best viewed as a transitional source of electricity so the lights don’t go off, Connecticut should build storage to hold gas when the pipelines are not well utilized in the summer, so we have plenty in the winter. It would be far cheaper than counting on LNG shipments to our ports.
Connecticut has solutions to our energy problems. Somewhere and someone will see changes with more solar and wind, new fossil or nuclear plants, pipelines or storage. If we collectively do not want the lights to go out, we will have to accept change in some fashion. We can’t count on other states to fix our issues, not have them save us money. We must act ourselves for our own and collective benefit.

We’ll move quickly to correct the record and provide the best information we have at the time.
State police are investigating a fire at the governor residence in Harrisburg as arson.
Gov. Josh Shapiro said troopers woke him and his family up around 2:00 a.m. Sunday morning to evacuate. Harrisburg city firefighters extinguished the blaze at residence along North Front Street. The governor posted details about the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities,” Shapiro said. “Last night, they did so for our family – and Lori and I are eternally grateful to them for keeping us safe.”

The fire occurred on the first night of Passover, the eight-day Jewish holiday marking the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Shapiro is Jewish.
State House Republican Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford/Fulton) condemned the alleged arson attack.
“The preliminary details about last night’s arson attack at the Governor’s Residence are beyond disturbing and I condemn this, and every act of political violence, in the strongest terms,” he said. “I am glad to hear Gov. Shapiro and his family are safe and no injuries resulted from what appears to be a heinous act.”
Former GOP Governor Mark Schweiker called the attack, “a despicable act of cowardice.”
“Kathy and I hope all Pennsylvanians will join us in keeping Josh, Lori and their family in their prayers,” Schweiker said in a statement. “We thank the firefighters who bravely responded to the fire, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement for their ongoing efforts to bring the coward who attacked the People’s House to justice.”
State police, which is leading the investigation, says the blaze caused a significant amount of damage to a portion of the home.
A reward of up to $10,000 is being offered through PSP Tips for the arrest and conviction for the person or people responsible. Anyone with information is encouraged to call 1-800-4PA TIPS (1-800-472-8477).

As Gov. Josh Shapiro held a press conference to announce an arrest in the incident, he stood in front of a large reception room that had been set up for a Passover Seder. It was blackened and charred. The wreckage could be seen though busted windows and doors.
It was almost unrecognizable from the night before when the governor, who is Jewish, held a Seder for family and friends to mark the first night of the Passover holiday. A photo of the preparation posted to his Facebook page on Saturday showed a Seder plate on a gold table cloth, an open bottle of wine and copies of the Haggadah, a Jewish text about the Hebrews’ exodus from Egypt brought out every year for the holiday.
Hours after the Seder ended, Shapiro said he and his family were woken up by a member of his security detail banging on his door. The state trooper said they had to evacuate immediately. Someone had broken into the residence, set the reception room ablaze with a homemade incendiary device, and was able to get out before being apprehended. According to State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens, the attack appeared planned and methodical.
Shapiro, his wife and children, their two dogs and another family that was staying with them were all evacuated safely. The fire was extinguished.
So far, no motive has been determined, and it’s unclear if the attack was at all related to the holiday or Shapiro’s Jewish heritage, though a suspect, 38-year-old Cody Balmer, is in custody.
Speaking to the press from a podium on the lawn, Shapiro was visibly emotional. He said the event traumatized his family and the governor’s residence staff.

“If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday,” Shapiro said. “If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this: We celebrated our faith last night proudly, and in a few hours we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover.”
“We’ll clean this up, we’ll get it repaired, we’ll get it rebuilt, we’ll get rid of that smell of fire and smoke, and we’ll be back very soon,” Shapiro added. “We’ll be back to welcome the community into this residence.”

Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside.
Pennsylvania State Police Col. Chris Paris identified the 38-year-old as Cody Balmer. Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Sunday afternoon that his office was preparing to file charges against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded police after entering the residence grounds and setting the fire with “homemade incendiary devices.” He was arrested Sunday afternoon shortly before the scheduled 4:30 p.m. news conference, police said.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” Biven said “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”
Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m. a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
  Governor Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania State Police provide an update on the act of arson that took place at the Governor’s Residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders. The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith. The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said. Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
 ‘Large and complex crime scene’

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI. Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case. While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said. Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chainlink fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds. 
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith. The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said. Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
‘Large and complex crime scene’
The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI. Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case. While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone. 
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said. Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chainlink fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds.

State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

Josh Shapiro and his family – in the wake of a targeted attack on the governor’s residence.
Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican, said on Sunday morning hours before an arrest was made that he’s “relieved that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe after an arsonist set fire to the Governor’s residence overnight.”
“I join all Pennsylvanians in praying for the Shapiro family following this criminal act,” Sunday wrote. “I’m grateful for the first responders who quickly responded. The Office of Attorney General stands ready with any resources needed to find the culprit of this senseless act of violence.”
Former GOP Governor Mark Schweiker called the attack, “a despicable act of cowardice.”
“Kathy and I hope all Pennsylvanians will join us in keeping Josh, Lori and their family in their prayers,” Schweiker said in a statement. “We thank the firefighters who bravely responded to the fire, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement for their ongoing efforts to bring the coward who attacked the People’s House to justice.”
U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) said he’s “horrified by the arson” attack that took place. 
“There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our state or our country,” Boyle said. “I’m relieved the governor and his family are safe, and I’m grateful to the first responders who acted quickly.”
Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton, a Democrat from Philadelphia, said she was “appalled by the dangerous & despicable attack.”
“Cowardly acts of violence meant to stoke fear have no place in our state,” McClinton wrote. “I am grateful to our first responders who responded ensured that the Shapiro family & others were safe.”
Several Republicans, who are weighing a run for governor next year, also offered words of support to Shapiro.
“I’m thankful Governor Shapiro and his family are safe,” state Treasurer Stacy Garrity wrote early on Sunday afternoon. “I want to thank law enforcement and first responders for their swift response.”
U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) issued a lengthy statement saying that “violence has no place in our politics—none.”
“I’m thankful that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe following last night’s terrible incident. No elected official or their loved ones—regardless of party—should ever have their safety threatened for serving the public,” Meuser wrote. “We live in a country where we resolve our differences through debate, elections, and the rule of law—not through fear, intimidation, or violence.”
Meuser went on to describe it as an “attack on the values we all share as Americans,” and added that “it is particularly disgraceful that this occurred on Passover—a sacred time of faith, freedom, and reflection.”
GOP State Sen. Doug Mastriano, who lost to Shapiro in the 2022 race for governor and is reportedly considering another bid for the office, seemingly offered a different response on Sunday afternoon.
“He has a detachment of state police there 24/7 and a ten foot fence with complete surveillance……,” Mastriano wrote on X in response to an article from the New York Post about the incident.
Mastriano has since deleted that post and has not issued a statement on his social media accounts following the press conference announcing that a Harrisburg man has been arrested in connection to the attack.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/governor-josh-shapiro-fire-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-13 19:04:25.225132

State police are investigating a fire at the governor residence in Harrisburg as arson.
Governor Josh Shapiro said troopers woke him and his family up around 2:00 a.m. Sunday morning to evacuate. Harrisburg city firefighters extinguished the blaze at residence along North Front Street. The governor posted details about the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities,” Shapiro said. “Last night, they did so for our family – and Lori and I are eternally grateful to them for keeping us safe.”
The fire occurred on the first night of Passover, the eight-day Jewish holiday marking the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Shapiro is Jewish.
“This morning’s arson attack at the Pennsylvania Governor’s Residence, which threatened the lives of Gov. Shapiro and his family, is a despicable act of cowardice. Kathy and I hope all Pennsylvanians will join us in keeping Josh, Lori and their family in their prayers,” former Governor Marl Schweiker said in a statement. “We thank the firefighters who bravely responded to the fire, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement for their ongoing efforts to bring the coward who attacked the People’s House to justice.”

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will remove gender dysphoria from disabilities protected under federal law, but it’s still unclear whether 17 Republican state attorneys general will continue a related lawsuit that could dismantle federal protections for all people with disabilities.
Last fall, Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over the Biden administration’s addition of a gender identity-related disorder to the disabilities protected under a portion of federal law known as Section 504.
Republican attorneys general from 16 other states joined the lawsuit: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.
But they  faced a swift backlash earlier this year. Disability advocates pointed to parts of their lawsuit that asked the court to find all of Section 504 unconstitutional, not just the update that included gender dysphoria.
If the court agrees, advocates fear that schools, workplaces, hospitals and other entities could refuse to provide disability accommodations they’ve been required to provide for the past 50 years.
AGs hurried to distance themselves. Arkansas Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin, Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and others adamantly denied that interpretation and said their only goal was to remove protections for people with gender dysphoria.
The new HHS ruling seems to achieve what the AGs said they wanted. It essentially declares that the Biden update adding gender dysphoria to disability law can’t be enforced.
But the broad language of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility, some experts say, for the court to strike down the entirety of Section 504 protections.
The state AGs’ position should become clearer in a few days. They’re scheduled to file an update with the court on April 21.

While filming a documentary about oceans on a boat in the Pacific Ocean several years ago, producer and director Steve Cowan encountered a shocking scene. “We were surrounded from horizon to horizon by floating plastic,” Cowan said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Cowan and his colleagues at the nonprofit Habitat Media wondered where all of this plastic was coming from—and why so much of it is manufactured in the United States. With “Single-Use Planet,” their new documentary premiering on PBS in April, they hope to answer those questions.
The documentary tells the stories of two states with a major stake in the plastics economy: Louisiana and Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania segment focuses on Beaver County’s Shell ethane cracker plant, a massive facility for manufacturing plastics that began operations in the fall of 2022.
Since then, residents living nearby have complained about noise, odors and light pollution, and local activists are concerned that Shell is exacerbating the region’s existing plastic pollution problems.

In a previous statement to Inside Climate News, a Shell spokesperson said the company was “committed to the health and well-being of its employees and the surrounding community,” and said the company was working to improve so that it “can be the good environmental steward, neighbor, and business partner this region wants and deserves.” Though Shell was lured to Pennsylvania with more than $1.6 billion in tax subsidies, new research shows that the promised economic boom has failed to materialize.
“There are stories of explorers trying to find the headwaters of the Amazon River, and it takes them to the Andes, to these tributaries way up in the steep slopes of those mountains,” Cowan said. “I liken that to what we’ve done with this story. We took it all the way to the headwaters of plastic to answer, where does this stuff come from?”
Inside Climate News spoke with Cowan about the origins of the project and what he and his team learned about the Shell plant. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
ICC: How did you decide to focus on Pennsylvania and Louisiana for this film?
Steve Cowan: Trying to figure out where all this plastic was coming from, our first stop was the petrochemical facilities, these giant ethane crackers that produce plastic from natural gas and fossil fuels. We talked to people that live nearby in these communities, and a lot of the people aren’t too happy with it.


In Louisiana, the [companies] site these facilities in areas with marginalized communities, where they don’t expect there’s going to be a lot of complaints and pushback. That was our Louisiana story, and then we went further upstream, because the Mississippi River eventually becomes the Ohio River through Appalachia. We checked out the … Shell ethane cracker plant in Beaver County, and we talked with community members there, many of whom wish that that plant never arrived.
To feed the plant, they need ethane. It’s an ethane cracker, and that’s natural gas. There’s a lot of fracking that goes on in Pennsylvania and Ohio and West Virginia, and some people aren’t so happy with that either.


ICC: I think a lot of people don’t realize that plastics manufacturing is fed by fracking wells.
Cowan: We made that connection, and we asked this community, well, how did Shell end up here? If half the people are horrified by it, how did it happen? And they all said, “It was a $1.6 billion subsidy provided by our legislators in our state capital in Harrisburg. They’re the ones that invited … Shell. They’re the ones that championed and enabled the whole thing.” So we went further upstream to Harrisburg and met some of these lawmakers.
In Harrisburg, talking with these legislators, the biggest part of their funding is coming from fossil fuel, natural gas and petrochemical companies, and so they need that money. We tried in the film not to villainize these lawmakers, in part because it takes so much money to get elected, and average citizens don’t have the kind of cash they need to buy all the TV ads and everything they have to do to win a seat in the House or the Senate or the governor’s mansion.
So they have their go-to sources [of funding]. They don’t even have to go ask for it. The lobbyists are coming in and offering it, and it’s just this low-hanging fruit. Whether it be a subsidy bill or whether it be some kind of law to ease regulations and oversight of the industries, the lobbyists draft the legislation, they take it to the lawmakers and the lawmakers make policy out of them. These are the true headwaters of plastic.
We did meet some lawmakers in Harrisburg that are in the film, like Sen. Katie Muth or Chris Rabb from Philadelphia in the House, and they’re actually more in touch with the realities that a lot of their constituents have to face. They’re in the minority, though. That’s the problem. They vote against this, or they try to get some legislation going to bring in renewables, and they can’t even get the bills out on the floor. They’re powerless because they’re in the minority.
And the reason they stay in the minority is because this river of money is going to legislators who sign on with fossil fuels and plastic. It’s a worrisome thing, and I don’t see how, especially since the last election, it’s going to end any time soon.
ICC: What do you hope viewers will take away from “Single-Use Planet”?
Cowan: Change isn’t going to come from the top down. These people that have figured out how to stay in power, they’re not going to sponsor legislation to lessen the impact of industry or to change our electoral system. Change has to come from the bottom up.
And that’s actually how it happened in France–they have general strikes. They shut the whole economy down. And it’s forced a lot of reforms in France, and I don’t know if that’s what’s coming to the U.S. or not, but I hope that people realize that they need to get more involved. People need to engage these issues, rather than just going about their daily lives and hoping somehow that their elected representatives in Harrisburg or Baton Rouge or Washington, D.C., are going to do anything about this. They’re not.

Nearly three years after dousing the flames at the state’s largest waste incinerator, officials are still searching for way to deal with the mess created by the thousands of tons of trash local residents produce each day.
For the most part, the trash that was once burned to create electricity and ash at the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority in Hartford is now being placed onto tractor-trailers and rail cars and shipped hundreds of miles away to landfills in Pennsylvania and Ohio — a costly and ecologically-damaging solution that has many critics and few fans.
And while state officials have reported some progress getting people to divert things like food scraps and plastic bottles out of the waste stream, the scale of Connecticut’s trash problem has only grown.
MIRA’s closure in 2022 resulted in 640,000 tons of trash being sent out of state that year. By the next year, Connecticut was exporting 41% of all its municipal solid waste, roughly 940,000 tons of trash, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Connecticut isn’t the only state exporting its trash. With limited space in Midwestern landfills, the state’s municipalities and haulers are facing rising rates to ship trash beyond its borders. Those costs get passed along to Connecticut residents through taxes and collection fees, according to DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes.
“It is escalating and it’s going to escalate over time,” Dykes said. “The crisis is in the sense that we need to take urgent action, because developing new programs, new solutions to regain self sufficiency and replace that disposal capacity that the MIRA plan represented, takes time.”
 Finding — and funding — a plan

The trash problem has also befuddled state lawmakers, who have been largely unsuccessful in their efforts to pass a long-term solution.
Two years ago, municipal leaders objected to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont that would have charged cities and towns up to $5 for every ton of trash they ship out of state, in order to raise money to help build new facilities capable of handling trash within the state. Instead, lawmakers settled on a plan to authorize up to $500 million in bonding, through the Connecticut Green Bank, should the state ever settle on a plan to build a new waste-to-energy facility. That money remains unspent.
The latest attempt to address the issue this year, House Bill 6917, takes a more modest approach.
The legislation would charge a fee of $1.50 on every ton of waste shipped out of state. Currently, that fee is only being applied to waste that is burned at the state’s four remaining waste-to-energy facilities. In addition, it removes language within state law that diverts up to $2.8 million collected each year from those existing fees into the state’s general fund. Instead, all of that money would go to a sustainable materials management account where it is earmarked for local waste-reduction projects.
“What we’re trying to do in this bill is actually to get parity between waste that’s processed in and out of state, so that we get a bit more money into that program,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who is leading the legislature’s efforts on waste this session as co-chair of the Environment Committee.
The bill would also require that large producers of food waste — including supermarkets, wholesalers, food manufacturers and conference centers — adopt their own written policy for the donation of excess food, further reducing what they throw away.
Critics of the legislation, however, argue that adding fees wouldn’t serve as an incentive to handle trash in-state if there’s nowhere to put it. Beyond Connecticut’s existing waste-to-energy facilities, recycling centers and a handful of composting options, the state has no permanent, active landfills accepting household trash.
“You’re trying to collect money. Let’s have a plan first, and then we can talk about about funding that plan,” said Brian O’Connor, the director of public policy for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. “There’s no long-term strategy from [DEEP] at this point.”
In written testimony filed on an early version of the bill, Lewis Dubuque of the National Waste and Recycling Association questioned whether the fee would be applied to other materials beyond municipal solid waste that are disposed of at incinerators or shipped out of state.
“In any event, such a fee will naturally be passed on to the customer and, given the claims that the disposal of material is becoming more expensive in challenging fiscal times, the NWRA questions why the imposition of a new fee on the consumer is warranted,” Dubuque said. Dubuque did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.
For environmental advocates, the bill represents an initial step toward reducing the amount of trash being shipped across state lines to slowly decompose in a landfill, which many see as the worst possible solution.
“If you think about diesel trucks and how much greenhouse gas emissions they’re emitting every single day driving from central Connecticut to Ohio and Pennsylvania, that is a significant amount of carbon dioxide, and it’s not moving us towards our our climate change goals that we set for ourselves,” said Julianna Larue, an organizer with the Sierra Club. “We’re going backwards, right?”
In addition to the climate considerations, residents who live in the vicinity of those landfills have said they’re fed up dealing with the smell. In some cases they’ve even pushed to close the facilities.
Lawmakers are also weighing other proposals this session intended to reduce the amount of waste produced in Connecticut and the associated environmental impacts.
House Bill 6229 would ban single-use plastics and polystyrene containers, which critics argue clog up the waste stream, starting in 2026. Past efforts to ban or phase out those plastics have failed in the face of opposition from the restaurant and hospitality industry. Another, Senate Bill 80, seeks to place tougher standards on the burning of medical waste following complaints from residents living close to a waste-to-energy facility in Bristol.
All three bills have passed out of the Environment Committee and are either awaiting fiscal review or have been referred to the Appropriations Committee.
Parker said he expects H.B. 6917 to generate between $1 million and $3 million a year for waste diversion efforts. That’s far less than what Lamont’s original 2023 legislation would have raised — an estimated $11 million.
“The truth is that some of these projects, you know, cost a lot of money,” Parker said. “We’re going to be reasonable about what’s going to be funded here. It’s not going to be the be-all, end-all to the solution.”

Pilot programs
Barring a plan to build any major new waste-processing facilities in Connecticut, efforts to confront the trash problem have mostly focused on getting specific items such as food scraps and plastic out of the waste stream.
To that end, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection last month awarded $15 million in grants to nine municipalities to fund infrastructure projects related to recycling and composting.
In New Haven, for example, the city plans to build a new $3.3 million sorting facility at the transfer station, within the footprint of the old incinerator.
Starting in 2027, officials will distribute colored, biodegradable trash bags to residents on local garbage routes, instructing those residents to fill the bags with compostable materials like leftover scraps of food or coffee grounds. The bags will be picked up from curbside bins along with other garbage on trash day, then taken to the local sorting station. Once sorted, the organic waste will be sent off to a digester facility to be turned into biogas, and, eventually, compost.
The goal, officials say, is to divert roughly one-fifth of the city’s residential trash — the heavy, soggy and dense food scraps — away from Connecticut’s overloaded municipal waste stream.
“Most of the trash here … goes to Bridgeport and is burned,” Mayor Justin Elicker said during a press conference announcing the project earlier this month. “That is clearly not the best solution for compostable materials that could be used for such better purposes.”
If it is successful, New Haven’s program will follow on the heels of larger cities such as New York which began a mandatory composting program on April 1.

In an attempt to encourage towns to find innovative ways to reduce their solid waste stream, lawmakers created the sustainable materials management account in 2022. Since then, the program has awarded about $5.2 million in funding for local pilot programs focused on organics diversion and pricing models that charge residents based on the amount of trash they throw away.
Some of those pilots have already concluded with DEEP officials reporting promising results. Between 2021 and 2023, Connecticut saw a 368% increase in food scrap diversion, with 37,549 tons of waste sent for composting in the latter year.
Several towns including Middletown, Woodbury, Madison, Kent and others have also opted to continue their program beyond the pilot period, according to DEEP.
Speaking to reporters in New Haven last month, Dykes said lessons from those pilots informed state officials as they were reviewing applications for the most recent round of infrastructure grants — which included the New Haven sorting facility, a food-waste collection program in Manchester and a commercial-scale composting facility in southeastern Connecticut. In addition to the nine projects that were selected for funding, Dykes said a dozen other applications were submitted.
“It just goes to show how many communities and municipalities are really leaning into finding these solutions and want to implement common-sense solutions to recycle and divert organics,” Dykes said. “And so we’re hopeful that this will just be the beginning of more funding rounds.”
Still, some officials overseeing the handling of municipal waste say that local grant-funded programs do not go far enough to address the full scale of the state’s waste issues.
Jennifer Heaton-Jones, the executive director of western Connecticut’s Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority, said that lawmakers needed to take a more “holistic” approach to addressing the issue including better education campaigns, requiring towns to offer access to food scrap diversion programs and expanding capacity to handle waste locally.
“This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior and making better decisions about material management, from their homes to the curb to the transfer station,” she said.
Heaton-Jones did praise some aspects of the legislation drafted by lawmakers this year, including $500,000 to help DEEP enforce a law requiring large producers of food waste to utilize composting facilities and $250,000 to support an informational campaign run by the Recycle CT Foundation.
“I feel like we’re not going to solve the waste issue with the state, obviously, with this bill,” Heaton-Jones said. “I mean, there’s some good things in it… but we need more than that.”
H.B. 6917 also requires that DEEP study the feasibility of a proposal to make the manufacturers of consumer packaging pay for some or all of the costs of handling that material once it’s thrown away — also known as extended producer responsibility. Connecticut has EPR programs in place for hard-to-recycle items such as mattresses, tires and mercury thermostats, and advocates argue that the ubiquitous presence of packaging in the waste stream has exacerbated the state’s existing trash problems.










This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior.


– Jennifer Heaton-Jones, Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority


That proposal, even as a study, drew objections from waste haulers and recyclers who argued DEEP should first update its nearly decade-old survey of all the material that ends up in Connecticut’s waste stream.
The ranking Republican on the Environment Committee, state Rep. Pat Callahan, R-New Fairfield, echoed those concerns at a meeting last month when he said lawmakers should wait for the results of a new assessment before they “figure out what further work needs to be done.”
To address some of those concerns, Parker said the language in the bill was adjusted to postpone the packaging study by a year, so it would coincide with DEEP‘s next waste characterization study.
“The big picture is we’re just continuing to move this conversation forward,” Parker said, calling the bill “a work in progress.”
State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, compared the current crisis to the situation facing Connecticut in the late 1980s, when she served as chair of the Environment Committee. At the time, aging landfills such as Hartford’s notorious “Mount Trashmore” served as eyesores and sources of pollution in local drinking water.
To close the landfills, Connecticut implemented a mandatory recycling law in 1991 and partnered with private companies to build its network of waste-to-energy facilities with enough capacity to burn as much trash as the state could produce, without needing to import more trash from elsewhere to stay profitable.
Lawmakers also established a $1-per-ton fee — later raised to $1.50 — on trash sent to those facilities to support their continued operations. That system, she said, worked for nearly three decades until the age of the facilities and the diversion of revenues from fees into the state’s general fund caused them to close or reduce their output.
By expanding the fee to trash shipped out of state and using it to fund compost and recycling programs, Mushinsky said she believes Connecticut can again reach a point where it can handle whatever trash is left over, whether through waste-to-energy incineration or some other emerging technology.
“It’s not rocket science, you just need money to do it,” Mushinsky said.

HOMEWOOD — Ellen McLaughlin said she wasn’t speaking for herself.
“I speak for the salamanders,” she told those gathered at a community meeting in late March.
McLaughlin, a retired Samford University biology professor, was one of dozens who showed up at the Homewood Senior Center to express their frustration over a proposed “town square” development that will threaten the habitat of spotted salamanders in the Birmingham suburb.
Flanked by oil paintings of wildflower fields and a waterfall, she made her views well known.
“They require a certain habitat, and to destroy that habitat is going to destroy that population of salamanders,” she told those in attendance, including representatives of Landmark Development, the company overseeing the project on behalf of the university. “So it’s imperative that we keep that.”
McLaughlin wasn’t alone in her concerns. Again and again, residents and other stakeholders present at the community meeting hosted by the development company brought up the plight of the amphibian that has, over time, become part of the character of Homewood, home of a salamander festival held annually for two decades.
Bob Dunn, CEO of Landmark Development, said in an interview that he understands residents’ concerns but that he can’t promise that there will be no impact to the spotted salamanders and the vernal pools where they lay their eggs each year.

“Could we encroach on portions of the habitat? As you look at the plan, there are areas where there’s some encroachment,” he said. “But we think the mitigating opportunities will more than compensate for the type of encroachment we’re talking about.”
Residents, biologists and members of the university community interviewed by Inside Climate News largely disagree. Currently proposed plans don’t leave room for changes that would protect the salamanders’ current habitat, they argue, putting at risk the survival of a population that’s called the city home for generations.

A salamander’s tale

The spotted salamander has long been a unique part of Homewood’s history.
Since at least the 1960s, and likely much longer, experts say, the amphibians have spent much of their time burrowing on the slopes of Shades Mountain, making their homes beneath the fallen leaves and limbs of the forest.
Once a year, as temperatures in Alabama begin to climb, the amphibians migrate from the mountain’s slopes across South Lakeshore Drive, a two-lane road, to the springtime, “vernal” pools located in a narrow patch of woods adjacent to existing sports fields that line Shades Creek.

The trek is not always simple. Most often, the salamanders embark on their journey at night, and typically in heavy rains—likely as a way to keep wet and avoid predators.
James Seay Brown Jr., a retired folklorist and natural historian who worked at Samford, wrote about Homewood’s relationship with the spotted salamander in his book, “Distracted by Alabama: Tangled Threads of Natural History, Local History and Folklore.”
When Brown arrived at Samford in 1971, the university’s environmental community was already tracking the salamanders and their annual migration. Brown quickly became obsessed with their yearly trek, and the fixation rubbed off on others over time.
Soon, Brown recruited his wife Michelle to serve as a sort of salamander Paul Revere—tasked with calling a list of interested locals when her husband had confirmed that the amphibians were on the move.
In 2002, Brown awoke to a heavy rain around three in the morning, traveled down to the migration site and confirmed the annual journey had begun. He alerted Michelle, who he said became nervous about calling one person in particular on the list — a Samford executive — so late at night. The executive’s wife answered, surprised by a woman’s voice on the other end of the line, but awkwardly agreed to share the news with her husband. The executive soon showed up for the crossing. So did his wife.
“And here were highly placed administrators of [University of Alabama at Birmingham] and Samford, plus otherwise upstanding businesspeople, professionals, and good family folks, all willing to risk their reputations by such behavior—though I might note some brought children as an excuse,” Brown wrote. “My wife later remarked drily that the ranks of insanity were growing. This may also have been the reaction of Homewood’s mayor at that time, Barry McCulley, when he first heard about it from some police report about flashlights in the woods near the high school at eleven o’clock at night and suspicious answers to straightforward police questions.”

By 2003, the excitement and intrigue over the annual salamander crossing had reached its peak, and city officials in April of that year officially designated a nearly half-mile stretch of South Lakeshore Drive as a salamander crossing—painted crosswalks and street signs included.
By the next year, the city hosted the first Salamander Festival, a tradition that’s continued to this day. In 2024, more than 900 attendees flocked to Homewood for the event, according to organizers.
In 2008, the city of Homewood took another step that aided the salamander—designating around 65 acres of land along South Lakeshore Drive, opposite the breeding pools, as a protected natural area: Homewood Nature Preserve.
Now, though, residents of Homewood fear the worst—that the desire for development will outweigh the need for environmental stewardship of the amphibians’ habitat. That’s why residents like Ellen McLaughlin say they will speak for the salamander.

A Creekside development

March’s community meeting at the Homewood Senior Center was partly a result of the city’s planning commission encouraging Landmark Development to more deeply engage with citizens over their concerns, according to city officials.
The development, called Creekside, is billed by the developer as a “dynamic, walkable, livable town square environment” that will feature everything from “trendy shops to delightful eateries.”
The project is part of Samford University’s “Samford Horizons” initiative, which the university touts as “a visionary master plan to ensure Samford remains among the world’s most respected Christ-centered universities.”
Samford, founded by the Alabama Baptist State Convention in 1841 as Howard College, has increased enrollment for the past 16 years in a row. University officials have said the proposed Creekside development will help to accommodate that growth, providing additional housing, retail options and sport facilities.
At the March meeting, members of the public were vocal about their opposition to the project. No one expressed support for the developer’s proposal.
Of particular concern to residents is a proposed 10-story hotel—which would be the tallest building in the city—and the implications for traffic, stormwater management and environmental stewardship as it relates to the spotted salamander.
Historically, the university has often found itself in tension with city officials and residents over development. Echoes of that tension surfaced in the community meeting.
“Samford wants to do this to us,” Becky Smith, a Homewood resident, said in a deep Southern drawl. “We don’t want you coming down here to tell us what you’re going to do to us.”

The framing of the new development as providing a new “town square” for Homewood belies Samford’s claims that it wants to develop a closer relationship with the city, she argued.
“Samford has said they want to be more a part of Homewood,” Smith said. “This is trying to make Homewood more a part of Samford.”
After those comments, Colin Coyne, Samford’s vice president for finance, business affairs and strategy, spoke up, telling community members that the university’s past friction with the community that surrounds it is not lost on him.
“I acknowledge the fact that we’ve not always been the best neighbors,” Coyne said. “But we have to start somewhere. This is our best attempt.”
Dunn, who spoke on behalf of Landmark at the meeting, said that the developer would do its best to mitigate the impact of the Creekside project on the spotted salamander’s springtime habitat. Landmark would certainly not be able to guarantee, however, that its engineering fixes would solve every problem, he said.
“It’s about really elevating issues that we have to stay focused on to continue to work to find good solutions that balance out all of the issues that go into a development,” he said. “We solve over here for the salamanders, and it creates an issue somewhere else. You’ve just got to find a balance.”

A threat to the salamander

The day after the meeting, Megan Gibbons put on her boots and waded into a place she feels at home, and where the salamanders do, too: the vernal pools just north of South Lakeshore Drive. There, she carefully reached into the water again and again, searching for the salamander egg masses she’s fighting to protect.
It’s here, in the shadow of Shades Mountain, near the shores of Shades Creek, where Gibbons, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has done some of her best teaching. It’s here, in the stagnant springtime pools, shaded by the trees overhead, where she’s sparked the passions of students from across the country. And it’s not just for their benefit that she wants these salamanders to survive. It’s for the next generation of salamanders, too.

It doesn’t take Gibbons long to find an egg mass. She smiles as she holds out the jelly-like blob that can contain between 10 and 100 eggs. Through the translucent membranes, you can see the tiny salamanders beginning to take shape— amphibians that will soon hatch and make their first journey over to the slopes of Shades Mountain.
“This one’s pretty far along,” she says of the egg mass, pointing out the various points of interest. “You can see its little body, and you can see its little fluffy gills coming out the side of its head.”
In this environment, Gibbons is doing what she loves best—teaching. It had been the same the evening before, when Gibbons—not then in her wading boots—had stood studiously along one wall of the meeting room, an educational poster about the salamander habitat at her side. One by one, she spoke to residents who approached her, explaining the risks posed by the impending development.
A day later, as she stood holding the egg mass, she weighed again what was at risk. It’s about balance, Dunn had said at the meeting. Balance in favor of what, Gibbons wondered.
“They’re going to make a lot of money from this,” Gibbons said of the developer. “What do we get out of this? What do the salamanders get out of this? I get to see the animal I love destroyed. That’s what I get.”

Soon, Gibbons had carefully replaced the egg mass into the vernal pool and climbed back to the adjacent roadway. A passerby, a retiree named Barbara Koehler, stopped to ask if Gibbons was looking for salamanders. She’d been at the meeting with the developer, too, she said, and didn’t like much of what she heard.










“What do we get out of this? What do the salamanders get out of this? I get to see the animal I love destroyed. That’s what I get.”

“I think the guy from Landmark was smooth,” she said. “He was good at glossing over the issue. He knows exactly what he should say to get people to think he’s not going to do exactly what he knows he’s going to do.”
Throughout the meeting, Dunn had emphasized that direct community engagement was not technically a required part of development in Homewood, Koehler recalled. Any construction could move forward simply with the necessary approvals from the Homewood City Council. Engagement would be ideal, Dunn said, but was not a mandate. To Koehler and Gibbons, that felt like a threat—an insinuation that meaningful community engagement could stop at any time if it suited the developer.
Koehler, a self-described birder and naturalist, said she’s opposed to the development.
“It’s just not a good idea,” she said. Her gaze soon pointed to the skyline, darting from tree to tree as birds chirped eagerly in the daylight sun. “This is worth protecting.”
Finding a way forward
What Dunn said about a lack of required input from residents is largely true.
On April 1, Dunn attended a meeting of the planning commission, a body required to recommend either approval or denial of the development plan by the Homewood City Council. Only Dunn—no residents or other stakeholders—was allowed to speak, according to a Homewood recording of the session. The CEO characterized the feedback he’d received from residents as “overwhelmingly positive.”
During the presentation, however, Dunn announced the publication of a report containing potential adjustments to the original development plan based on comments from residents. Ninety-two percent of written comments were about environmental stewardship, according to the developer’s own numbers.
The adjustments in the updated document include potential consideration of a “repositioning” of proposed sports fields that were slated to cover nearly the entire area from Shades Creek to South Lakeshore Drive, though representatives at the March meeting had noted that reducing the fields’ size wouldn’t be feasible given NCAA requirements for field dimensions. Plans for at least two salamander tunnels under South Lakeshore are also outlined in the updated plan—a potential pathway for the amphibians to cross the road without the risk of crossing traffic above ground.
Gibbons said in an interview that she’s not convinced that such slight adjustments will protect a species that has continually been left behind by commercial and residential development, not just in Homewood, but across the state and country. The risk of harming the species outweighs what’s to be gained by more and more development, she said.

Winslow Armstead, a member of the planning commission, pushed Dunn on providing more complete responses to residents’ questions and concerns, particularly when construction on the project could begin as early as this fall.
“I’m still sort of at a loss for the answers on some of those questions,” he told Dunn.
But ultimately, the planning commission recommended approval of the developer’s plan. It is set to be considered by the Homewood City Council in the coming weeks.
Continued engagement with Landmark Development is the best option for influencing what happens beside Shades Creek and Shades Mountain, particularly in today’s political climate, said David Butler, executive director of Cahaba Riverkeeper.
“There’s been a lot of hope that some federal or state agency would come in to help, but all of our environmental protections have been eroded,” he said. “All of the regulatory frameworks we’ve relied on have been broken down, and so we’re really going to have to go through and do a lot of that protection work on our own.”
That work, Butler said, can include direct discussions with developers—emphasizing to those proposing new growth that environmental stewardship must be a firm commitment from the beginning.
When it comes to Landmark and the Homewood project, Butler said he’s optimistic. Landmark reached out to Cahaba Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit, even before the first planning meeting, he said.
“I’m encouraged,” Butler said. “We would prefer no development, but that’s not a realistic position to take here. Development is going to happen. But at least we’re at the table. At least we have input.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s new Republican Party chairman is a former Democrat, but he’s been a Republican for nine years. Now he’s concerned about “Republicans In Name Only,” or RINOs, and wants to weed them out. 
“RINOs are a real thing,” Jim Eschenbaum said. “People say, ‘Don’t call us RINOs.’ Well, If you’re supporting abortion or gun control in any way, or any kind of sequestering of First Amendment rights, well, that does not align with conservative principles.”
Eschenbaum is a 62-year-old Hand County commissioner and farmer. He was a registered Democrat for 32 years until he and his wife switched when Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. 
“We said we couldn’t align with that one, so we were already planning to vote for Trump, and we both switched and became Republicans,” he said.
Change is ‘eminent’: Property-rights fight transforms this year’s SD Legislature

Eschenbaum got more politically engaged while fighting Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed $9 billion carbon capture pipeline, which he calls a “boondoggle.” The project would transport carbon dioxide emissions from dozens of ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where the carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. For the carbon it sequesters underground, the project could qualify for billions in federal tax credits for removing heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere.
The project’s need for eminent domain has motivated staunch opposition in South Dakota. Eminent domain is a method of forcing landowners to provide access to their land, in exchange for compensation determined by a court. 
Members of a grassroots movement against the pipeline’s use of eminent domain have had a big impact on South Dakota politics. They helped oust 14 state Republican lawmakers in last June’s primary election; referred what pipeline critics considered a pro-pipeline law to the ballot in November, where voters rejected it; and helped pass a law earlier this year barring carbon pipeline companies from using eminent domain.
Eschenbaum was a leading figure in the ballot referendum campaign.
“That did indeed gain me a lot of public exposure,” Eschenbaum said. “I did public informational meetings all over the state before the general election.”
Eschenbaum said the people he met along the way encouraged him to run for state Republican Party chairman. Some of those same people were becoming more active in the party themselves, and were shifting the party’s power balance to members of the anti-pipeline movement.
“They said we need good, honest, outspoken leadership,” he said. “I always tell people the truth is easy to speak. It’s not tough to speak what you believe.”
The state party elects a chair during the first meeting of its state central committee in each odd-numbered year. Voters include Republican county chairs, vice-chairs, state committee members and other designated officials. 
Eschenbaum was elected chairman in February and recently spoke with South Dakota Searchlight. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Many Republican donors now give money directly to causes or candidates rather than the state party. Is the state party organization relevant anymore, and why does it exist?
It is, because of the state organization, the county organizations, the county precinct committeemen and committeewomen, and the elected Republican officials in the county who are part of that county central committee.

It exists, most importantly, because of its party platform. That party platform is amended by the entire group of people, which would include precinct committeemen and committeewomen who go to the state convention. 
That platform shows what the South Dakota GOP stands for, and then I think our elected officials should be held to the task of promoting and voting along the lines of that platform. And so there is a purpose. 
I agree that people are funding candidates now instead of just throwing all the money to the state or state party. And I am perfectly OK with that. We don’t need any more money thrown to the state GOP than what we need to operate.
And we’ve already taken $77,000 out of the annual operating costs of the state GOP. Reggie Rhoden, Governor Rhoden’s son, was executive director and he was being paid $5,400 a month. He resigned at the meeting on February 22, when we did the elections. And we have decided thus far that we don’t need an executive director. Nobody knows that he was doing much.
What makes someone a Republican? 
I think you should be a constitutional conservative. And what I mean by constitutional conservative is that you vote and represent Republicans based on the two constitutions: the South Dakota Constitution and the U.S. Constitution, which everyone raises their right hand and swears an oath to when they’re sworn in. And then our party platform, which is conservative values. 
I have even proposed a South Dakota GOP scorecard. I don’t know if the state central committee will decide to do it, but it would be based on just those three principles, the two constitutions and the party platform.
How do you define the factions in the Republican Party? 
Well, it’s establishment power players and power to the people. 
The average Joes are realizing they have a voice. It comes from that 2024 primary. A lot of those candidates that got voted out, those incumbents that got voted out, had all kinds of money behind them from the ethanol plants and Summit Carbon Solutions. And the people got out and talked to people. This is what party politics should be. This is what government should be.
Do you want to unify Republicans? 
The best thing I can do to bring them all together is be open and honest and communicative with them, and I’ve been doing that.
I feel like the South Dakota GOP has been run by just a few power players, and they really didn’t want a new voice or input. I’ve stated this so many times: They ask for our money and our vote, but they don’t want our voice. They don’t want us involved in the process, and that’s just a terrible thought when you’ve got a state central committee that’s composed of about 200 members and the bylaws.
The bylaws make it clear to me that the chairman’s job is to facilitate the operations and decision-making of the state central committee. The state central committee should have the power, not the chairman or any other executive director or anything. The state central committee’s discussions and decision-making should guide the party.

And that’s what I ran on. I ran on a campaign of power to the people and being accessible to the people, and so far it’s going good. 
Some of these counties that did not want me elected are starting to talk to me. There was quite a while there that they didn’t like this farmer from Hand County getting in amongst the politicians.
But I said our state motto for God’s sake is “Under God the People Rule,” and some of these politicians, they get elected to office, they get a fat head about what it is they want to do or who they want to benefit, or using government to do business, and that’s not what government is intended to be. It’s supposed to be a minimal service to the people, and it just keeps growing and growing and growing and getting more authoritarian and powerful, and that’s not what our founders intended it to be, in my opinion. 
Why were you a Democrat? Why did you become a Republican?
My wife and I were both raised in Catholic Democrat families. And what do young people do if they haven’t really gotten themselves involved in politics in high school and started making decisions of which way they’re going to go? You register the same as your parents were. 
Well, as abortion became a bigger topic, my wife and I both agreed we wouldn’t support any Democrat that supported abortion.
The Democratic Party that we aligned with was more of that JFK kind of a Democrat that worked for the working class and common people. The party got away from that. They just got further and further away from it. They just keep stepping to the left even more all the time and supporting all kinds of foolishness that the Republican Party does not support.
Is there anything you’d like to add?
I’m extremely involved as chairman — like I said, responsive to people. I’m trying to make every Lincoln Day Dinner [a fundraising event for county Republican parties] across the state that I can possibly get to.
These are complaints that I heard about the previous chair or previous administration. You’d have a Lincoln Day Dinner, give plenty of notice for it, and they’re like, “No, very busy that day.”
If you take a job like this, you have to commit the time that it takes to do it right. I don’t know why that didn’t happen previously. It could be speculated probably two or three different ways. 
I said when I took this job, “I will not be a butt kisser to any politicians. I’m working for the people to elect good politicians.”
Just because you’re elected to office currently does not guarantee you’re going to get reelected to office again. It just doesn’t.

Where legislatures have refused to boost pay and benefits for workers, advocates have often taken the fight straight to voters. In recent years voters in Michigan, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly backed higher state minimum wages and guaranteed paid sick leave at the polls. But despite that strong showing of support, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now trying to water down or even roll back the measures their constituents approved.
In November, 58% of Missouri voters approved Proposition A, which raises the state minimum wage to $15 by 2026 and requires employers to provide paid sick leave. That level of support, said Missouri Jobs with Justice Policy Director Richard Von Glahn, stems from the fact that the measure “speaks to the experiences that voters have in their lives and where the economy is not working for them.” Typically, when his organization was out gathering signatures, voters expressed surprise that the minimum wage was not already $15 an hour and that paid sick leave was not already a guarantee. The vote shows it was “the clear will of what voters want,” Von Glahn said.
But in March the Missouri House passed legislation repealing the paid sick leave measure and undoing the state’s decades-long practice of regularly updating the minimum wage to keep up with inflation. If the bill becomes law, wage increases will cease in January 2027. To justify such changes, Republican state Rep. Mitch Boggs said, “Of course the people voted for it. It would be like asking your teenager if he wanted a checkbook. They’re going to vote for it every time.”
Republican state Rep. Scott Miller put it another way: “Just because 57% of the people that voted that day, voted in favor of something, that doesn’t make it right,” he said, adding, “They’re taking away the choice of businesses to engage in [the] free market.”
It’s not just lawmakers trying to undo the will of the voters, however. A group of businesses and individuals have asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the measure entirely, arguing that it violates the state Constitution’s single subject requirement. In their lawsuit they claim that wages and paid sick time are separate issues that should not have been combined in a single measure. Von Glahn pushed back on that argument: “Wages for hours worked and wages for paid sick time, that’s part of total compensation,” Von Glahn said. “As a working person, if I have money in my check, do I care if it’s from paid sick days or from hours that I worked?”
Nebraska voters passed their own paid sick leave ballot measure by a staggering 74% this past November. A majority of voters in every legislative district supported it, and the support was higher than for the lawmakers themselves. That’s not the only measure state lawmakers want to change, however. In 2022, nearly 59% of voters approved a measure that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 and keep increasing it in later years to keep up with inflation.
“Nebraskans really care about their neighbors,” Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha, said of the support both measures received. Paid sick leave, she said, is “a common sense solution.” As in Missouri, many voters she spoke to while gathering signatures were surprised it wasn’t already guaranteed.
And yet efforts to get lawmakers to take action themselves had not succeeded. “We tried for many years,” Giles said, including during the height of the pandemic when workers were getting sick by the thousands. But bills never moved forward. “After many, many attempts, we determined, ‘OK, we’re not going to get it through the Legislature, so let’s ask the people what they want,’” Giles said. “It was pretty clear what the people wanted: They wanted paid sick leave, they wanted to increase the minimum wage.”










“What does that mean for our overall democracy if people cannot exercise their voice and implement policies that are popular?”

That hasn’t stopped Nebraska lawmakers from seeking to change the measures approved by their constituents. Last year, two state lawmakers introduced bills to exempt young workers from the higher wage. Nebraska’s Legislature is officially nonpartisan, but one of the lawmakers was aligned with Democrats and the other with Republicans. The effort failed to advance in the Legislature.
This session, those two lawmakers and others are seeking to weaken both the minimum wage and sick leave policies. Legislative Bill 698, introduced by a Republican-aligned senator, would exempt companies with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirement. Yet the measure voters passed already makes an allowance for small businesses by allowing those with 20 or fewer employees to provide their workers with fewer days of leave. The bill would also exempt agricultural workers and those under 16 while eliminating employees’ right to sue their employers if they aren’t given the leave they’re owed. Giles argued that these changes gut “the core aspects” of the initiative.
Another bill introduced this year, Legislative Bill 258, meanwhile, would allow employers to pay people younger than 19 a lower minimum wage and would eliminate future minimum wage increases.
Beyond the impact on workers themselves, Giles thinks lawmakers’ actions could harm the entire state. “What does that mean for our overall democracy if people cannot exercise their voice and implement policies that are popular?” she said. Residents’ votes “should be honored.”
In both Missouri and Nebraska, conservative lawmakers have led the charge to roll back ballot measures. In Michigan, Democrats have joined the effort.
Back in 2012, Mothering Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for issues impacting women of color, started pushing for a paid sick leave bill in the state Legislature, but Republicans stood in the way. It became clear that “if we wanted to get this done, we would have to go straight to voters,” said Danielle Atkinson, founder of Mothering Justice. Her group was poised to do so, submitting over 280,000 signatures to put both paid sick leave and a higher minimum wage on the ballot in 2018. There was “always overwhelming support” from voters, she said, because it “was extremely popular and needed.”
But then the Republican-controlled Legislature stepped in that September. Over united Democratic opposition in the state Senate but with some Democratic support in the state House, lawmakers passed legislation to raise the minimum wage and institute a paid sick leave requirement before voters had the chance to weigh in. That wasn’t because lawmakers agreed with the ballot measures; they did so explicitly to come back and gut both measures later on, something that would have been much harder had the issues passed by ballot measure.










“We had an opportunity to be a pretty big part of a larger movement to eliminate a sub-minimum wage, and we missed it.”


– Danielle Atkinson, Mothering Justice


State Senate Republican Majority Leader Arlan B. Meekhof explained the vote this way: “The Senate adopted the policy to preserve the ability for this legislature and future legislatures to amend the statute to better fit our state and our economy.”
And lawmakers did in fact later amend the legislation by voting to delay the minimum wage increase by nearly a decade, scrap future inflation adjustments and preserve a lower tipped minimum wage. Lawmakers also exempted employers with fewer than 50 employees from paid sick leave and scaled it back for everyone else.
The groups behind the ballot measures fought back in the courts, arguing that what lawmakers did violated the state Constitution. That took “time, energy” and “a considerable amount of resources,” Atkinson said. “But we thought it was important to fight for the will of the people and direct democracy.” Last summer, it seemed they had finally won: The state supreme court found the Legislature had indeed violated the state Constitution and reinstated the original wage and sick leave measures. The new benefits were set to go into effect on Feb. 21. “We were extremely hopeful,” Atkinson said. “We were like, ‘Great, on to the next fight.’”
But the Legislature wasn’t done intervening. An hour before midnight on Feb. 20, lawmakers passed bills to preserve a lower tipped minimum wage, delay implementation of paid sick leave, exempt young and temporary seasonal workers, reduce guaranteed unpaid time off for employees of small businesses and strip workers of the right to sue employers for violating the new rights. This time, nearly half of Democrats in both chambers joined with all Republicans to pass the measures, and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed them into law.
The governor had “heard concerns about implementation of the new law,” according to a statement from spokesperson Stacey LaRouche, while the bill was under consideration, and supported “a bipartisan deal that protects servers and wait staff, while also providing certainty to small businesses and helping Michigan remain competitive.”
Business groups, particularly the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association, had lobbied hard for the tipped minimum wage changes. It was “very clear” that lawmakers of both parties “were being influenced by the business community,” Atkinson said. “The restaurant industry did a very good job of manufacturing outrage.”
Atkinson is frustrated that those tactics succeeded. “Michigan is a place where we’re known for workers’ rights, and we had an opportunity to be a pretty big part of a larger movement to eliminate a sub-minimum wage, and we missed it,” she noted, referring to the lower wage employers can pay tipped employees.
Having Democrats join in was even worse. “When you see Democrats introducing legislation that’s undermining workers’ rights, it makes … an easier target for Republicans to do the same,” she said. “It’s really unfortunate that that came from members of a party that claims to be for workers’ rights.”

“If there is the will, there’s always a way” Grall told the Phoenix after the measure passed the Senate 29-7 on Wednesday. “At least it’s going to be with [the House] now, and we’ll see if any other solutions are proposed.”
Grall’s is one of several high-profile proposals in limbo at this point in the 2025 Florida legislative session, having passed through one chamber going nowhere in the other. 
And with two-thirds of the regular legislative session now in the books, the outcome of some for these bills look cloudy at best. Yet those involved in the legislative process don’t dare say they are dead just yet.
“I would say there’s a lot of time left in the session,” Senate President Ben Albritton said this week when asked about the timeline for such bills and whether he might jumpstart their passage through the Senate.
“You’re asking me if I’m specifically open to the idea of referring a House bill that we receive it to say, Rules or Appropriations to have that bill heard and potentially move?” he said in repeating an inquiry with reporters on Wednesday. “The answer is yes.”
Guns
Among bills that the Senate President himself has been asked about on an almost weekly basis is HB 759, which would would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. Three measures in the Senate include that provision, but none of them have had a committee hearing.
Albritton has refused to commit to whether he might consider it — unlike his predecessor, Kathleen Passidomo, who was explicit in rejecting that idea during the past two sessions, when she was presiding officer.
“We’ve heard through back channels that there might be a bill to use as a bargaining chip with the House. Possibly for the budget or something else,” said Luis Valdes, Florida state director of Gun Owners of America.
“If that’s the case, Gun Owners of America aren’t actually fond of that, because using Second Amendment rights as a bargaining chip for something else is wrong, especially when hundreds of thousands of Floridians have had their rights violated by this law.”
Second Amendment enthusiasts were hyped before the session that their long-awaited hope that Florida would join the overwhelming number of states that allow for open carry would finally be realized, but Albritton shut down that thought in November.
Education
Then there’s SB 166, the public school “deregulation” bill sponsored in the Senate by North Florida Republican Corey Simon. Under this legislation, Florida high schoolers would not need to pass algebra or English final exams to graduate. The bill looks to “level the playing field amid other school-choice options,” Albritton said in a news release.
There is no House companion for the proposal.
Hands-free distracted driving
A year ago, Tallahassee Democratic Rep. Allison Tant’s distracted-driving bill cleared all three of its committees before dying on the House floor. Its Senate companion, however, was blocked in committees and never received a hearing.
Flash forward to 2025 and the exact opposite is happening: Sen. Grall’s bill cleared all of its three committee assignments before passing in the Senate by a two-thirds majority this week, while its House equivalent has yet to be heard in either of its two assigned committees.
Yet advocates aren’t ready to throw in the towel just yet, noting that the bill has been sent to the House in messages, making it available for action there.

“We are extremely hopeful that Rep. Perez will bring this forth, since he represents Miami-Dade, one of 11 counties that have passed a hands-free resolution asking lawmakers to act,” said a spokesperson for the Anthony Phoenix Branca Foundation, a group led by Demetrius Branca, who visited lawmakers around the state earlier this year in hopes of getting  them to pass the bill this year. A distracted driver killed Branca’s son in 2014.
 Health Care
The House has championed a number of scope-of-practice expansions this session but the Senate does not seem interested in doing the same. For instance, the House passed legislation allowing certified registered nurse anesthetists to work without having a written supervisory protocol with a physician.



The bill (HB 649) passed the House on April 3 on a 77-30 vote. Conversely, the Senate companion (SB 718) has been referred to three committees but has been heard by none.


 On the precipice


Other  bills that have soared through one chamber but are gaining no traction in the other, such as the “right to repair” legislation sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow in the Senate (SB 1132).
The measure would require manufacturers to more freely provide access to tools, manuals, and parts needed to repair certain agriculture and portable wireless equipment. It’s House companion, sponsored by Tampa Bay Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner (HB 235), hasn’t received a single hearing in any of the committees it was assigned to.



There’s the E-Verify measure (HB 955), which would require all Florida businesses to use the system to check the legal status of employees, which has cleared both of the committees that it was assigned to in the House. If approved, it would change existing law, which requires only businesses with 25 employees or more to employ the program.
However, E-Verify hasn’t moved at all in the Senate. Sarasota County Republican Sen. Joe Gruters told the Phoenix late Friday that the proposal is still viable in that chamber.

But that day of mass action was fueled by weeks of local demonstrations that have united a diverse coalition of people who say they are energized to take a stand.
Many of these community events have been organized by local activists who are raising alarm at the growing threats to Social Security and other programs that are being dismantled by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Others have been led by local labor unions that are protesting the assault on workers, exemplified by mass firings, dismantling of collective bargaining rights, and efforts to privatize government services. 
The Maine protests echo the national movement to “Fight the Oligarchy” being led by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Since March, the progressive duo has traveled to swing districts across the country, drawing historically large crowds to their rallies. At the events, the pair calls out the billionaire take-over of America, galvanizing huge swaths of everyday voters to become “brawlers” for the working class.

Grassroots Maine activists battle against billionaires
In the months since Trump took office, disparate grassroots groups have coalesced into a united movement, holding more than fifteen weekly actions across the state. These efforts led to the sizable “Hands Off” protests, which took place in more than 20 Maine cities and towns on April 5.
Many of the local groups are associated with national organizations including Indivisible, MoveOn and 50501. Despite that, local leaders emphasize a decentralized approach, allowing wide swaths of people to engage in communities closest to their homes.
“The point of having protests all over the place is people can actually get to them, and that resentment and the feelings of protest are everywhere,” said Elizabeth Leonard, who helps organize the weekly Takedown Tesla protest at the electric vehicle charging station in Waterville. “That’s why I want to keep organizing here.”
When Leonard, a retired Colby College history professor, started leading the Tuesday actions in February, only about 10-12 people showed up. Now, more than 50 people regularly attend, which she attributes to word-of-mouth organizing within local churches, colleges and community newsletters, as well as utilizing alternative social media sites like Bluesky.
Leonard said a lot of people are attracted to the action because Musk has blessed them with “a very possible goal” of pushing Tesla’s stock price down, which they hope will reduce the CEO’s influence over American democracy.
“We can chip away at Musk’s credibility as this genius and great businessman who is going to save the country,” Leonard said. “If he can’t hold his company together, then it’s likely he is going to trash the country like he is trashing Tesla.”
Many of the other local protests are similarly focused on the outsized power that Musk, Trump and other wealthy individuals have on the U.S. government.
However, Leonard noted that cuts to Social Security and other programs that many Mainers rely on will likely draw in others, as evidenced by many of the signs at last week’s mass demonstrations.
“I think the attack on Social Security is going to wake a lot of people up who are still sleeping,” Leonard said. “When their Social Security checks don’t come in, that will affect people across ages.”

Labor unions getting the word out
Unions and workers more broadly have been on the receiving end of many of the Trump administration’s actions, which have sparked informational pickets, labor protests and press conferences in several Maine towns. 
Last month, Trump took direct aim at unions with an executive action that rolled back collective bargaining rights with an executive order banning the agreements at government agencies with “national security interests.”
Local labor leaders say such actions are likely to galvanize workers.
“As history has shown, the labor movement can be an extremely powerful force against repressive regimes and totalitarian governments, which is why Musk and the Trump administration are fixated on taking away our rights and attacking our unions,” AFL-CIO President Matt Schlobohm said. “We will not stand by as our democracy is dismantled.”
On March 20, local postal worker unions participated in a national day of action with rallies in Bangor and Portland to inform people about efforts to privatize the U.S. Postal Service.
“We are out here to tell people hands off the Postal Service,” said Robert Perocchi, president of Bangor Area Local 536 of the American Postal Workers Union, who was among roughly 100 people that gathered outside the Bangor post office. He said such actions are important to educate people about how their lives are shaped by decisions made in Washington, D.C.. 
Since the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, the USPS has been self-funded, relying on revenue from postage and other sales rather than tax-payer money for their operations, despite contrary claims from Musk and the Trump administration. 
“The USPS is a public service we offer. The Trump administration is looking to sell it off to the rich and privatize it,” Perocchi said, noting that rural areas will be most impacted with the likely closure of smaller post offices. “It’s going to be about profits instead of service.”
Other demonstrations organized by local labor groups have drawn similarly robust support. In mid-March, the Maine State Nurses Association organized a protest against cuts to Medicaid that they said would “deteriorate services in the region.” More than 100 nurses, caregivers and patients gathered outside U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ Portland office to present a $4.1 billion check made out to the “billionaire class” paid for by “working people.” 
The check represented the amount of Maine Medicaid funding that could be at risk if Congress passes Republicans’ tax and spending plan, which would extend the president’s 2017 tax cuts and calls for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the Medicaid and Medicare health programs, to find at least $880 billion in cost savings.
Social Security workers have also organized events to call attention to efforts led by Musk to cut the agency, including plans to reduce phone services, fire staff and close field offices, including in Maine.
“We are greatly concerned that the DOGE team is pressuring the administration to make deep cuts in staff,” Christine Lizotte, a claims specialist and secretary treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1164, said at a recent press event in Hallowell. “That will delay payments, cause more errors and could even crash the whole system within months.”
Schlobohm with the Maine AFL-CIO said Maine’s labor movement will continue to lead efforts pushing back on the Trump administration.
“Hundreds of Maine union workers and our allies have taken to the streets to fight against the illegal and unconstitutional attacks on our democratic institutions and public services by billionaire Elon Musk,” Schlobohm said. “We are united in our resolve to protect Social Security, rural health care and nursing homes, the U.S. Postal Service and services for our veterans.”

(Photo by Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images)Congress is moving forward with a budget package likely to include severe cuts to Medicaid and CHIP (the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which funds Healthy Montana Kids). As Montana pediatricians, we know that cutting Medicaid to this extent won’t just affect children covered by Medicaid. It will be felt by every child, in every community.
Picture this: your child was just diagnosed with a life-altering chronic disease, but there is no specialty care available in the state. Or your newborn arrived earlier than expected, and there’s not a NICU bed available due to a hospital’s cuts to capacity.
Cuts to Medicaid and Healthy Montana Kids make these situations ever more likely. These programs are deeply important to the health of the children in the state. Medicaid and Healthy Montana Kids provide coverage for more than 94,000 children throughout Montana.
Medicaid coverage for kids also makes the difference between local hospitals having pediatric services and not having them. Medicaid covers 40% of births in Montana and 58% of children with special health care needs and disabilities, which means it is a critical source of funding for hospitals and clinics that provide pediatric services. Significant cuts such as those currently proposed would push many past the tipping point – directly resulting in an increased number of children and their families who need to leave Montana in order to treat life-threatening or chronic illnesses. 
Infrastructure for critically ill children in particular is fragile. There are only three small pediatric intensive care units in the state, and upending one of these hospital systems with funding cuts could mean closing one or more of these units, leaving Montana with even less access to stabilization of pediatric patients having an emergency.
As pediatricians, we want to avoid seeing families lose insurance coverage and hospitals lose services. And even more than that: We want to make sure we’re investing in our children. Evidence shows that Medicaid funding has long-term benefits. Children covered by Medicaid miss fewer school days, are more likely to graduate high school, be healthier adults and earn higher wages.
In fact, this year Montana’s state legislature has just reauthorized a Medicaid program covering 75,000 adults. A bipartisan majority recognized the importance of good health to Montana’s working families, as well as Medicaid’s significant long-term benefits to the state economy and rural health care infrastructure. This is a program that does so much good for so many people. We cannot afford to make the slashing cuts proposed right now in Congress.
Pediatricians urge Montana’s Congressional delegation to protect Medicaid and Healthy Montana Kids in the federal budget. We also urge our fellow Montanans to reach out and tell them how important Medicaid is to you and your family. Our children deserve access to health care when they need it — and to a healthy future.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca of Omaha, in the first of what they said will be more joint community meetings, said that on some issues they will be a link to help constituents resolve problems with city or other officials.
After a nearly two-hour session, the senators said they believed a key goal was accomplished — providing an open forum for people in their districts to express whatever concerns them.
“I realize there’s frustrations with there not being more attention paid here in the community. Obviously that is why we are here today,” Juarez at one point told the group gathered in an auditorium at Omaha South High School.
  Anxiety

Among those in the audience were Roger Garcia, Douglas County Board chairman, Yanira Garcia, board member of the Regional Metro Transit Board, and Don Preister, a Bellevue City Councilman and founding member of the South Omaha Neighborhood Alliance.

“What we saw also is some real anxiety about what is going on on the federal level,” said Guereca, referring to questions raised about actions of the Trump administration.
One audience member cited the president’s resistance to judicial orders and how that filters to his community and Latinos. Others commented on the demise of Juarez’s previous priority bill, Legislative Bill 299, which partly sought to allow immigrants — those with legal permission to work in the U.S. but who lack permanent residency — access to unemployment insurance benefits their employers pay into.
Juarez explained to the group that the bill was crushed under the weight of a Trump administration threat that the state could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid.
On state-related issues, perhaps the loudest reaction followed comments about the Legislature’s actions seeking to weaken voter-passed protections for paid sick leave. 
In November, nearly 75% of Nebraska voters approved a ballot measure requiring businesses with over 20 employees to pay sick leave to eligible workers based on hours worked. A bill making its way through the Legislature seeks additional carveouts that would not require paid sick leave for workers ages 14 and 15, seasonal ag workers or workers in businesses with 10 or fewer employees.
An audience member questioned why state lawmakers believe they need to make the law “better.”
“I think if we voted for it, it’s already better. Do they just think we can‘t be trusted with voting?” she said.
Guereca and Juarez said they oppose changing the voter-approved law. 
“We will continue to fight it,” Guereca said, saying that negotiations on the bill continue in the Legislature that wraps up its session in early June. 
A few audience members asked about the status of a Guereca bill that would allow local researchers quicker access to health data collected by the Nebraska Department of Human Services.
Guereca said that DHHS cites a “legal technicality” that effectively keeps local researchers waiting for the data a couple of years, when it is released by federal health officials. He is seeking to get Legislative Bill 446 on a path for passage yet this year, to allow certain qualified researchers quicker access to “de-identified data.” 
“If we’re looking for alarming trends, waiting two years isn’t going to cut it,” he said.
 Pay raise for lawmakers?

The senators were somewhat divided on a movement that could raise the pay for lawmakers.

Guereca said he was opposed: “I knew what I was getting into,” he said.
For Juarez, she said she is still contemplating, as she believes the $12,000 annual salary is a deterrent to running for the office, particularly for young people, and has created a legislative body that is not “a good representation of the state.”
“I was able to run, not because I’m wealthy, but because I am retired so I have other monthly income coming in,” she said.
Among other topics that surfaced were federal actions targeting immigrants. A South Omaha resident questioned the Omaha Police Department’s impound lot operations. A 24th Street merchant aired frustrations with the homeless population frightening customers.
“We don’t have in South Omaha a consistent ongoing voice of unity, of unified outrage, to confront government when it does things, not just nationally but locally,” said South Omaha activist Ben Salazar.
Juarez and Guereca talked about other bills they have championed, the lawmaking process and invited participants to weigh in on how often they want town halls.
One woman suggested at least once a month — ”because of the speed at which things are happening (nationally) that impact what you’re doing.”

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Opposing views among environmental groups and coastal scientists in Louisiana have spurred intense debates over the use of treated sewage to restore Louisiana’s wetlands. The conflicts could jeopardize some decades-long efforts to restore the state’s disappearing coast.
Wetlands are sometimes referred to as the kidneys of the earth — and for good reason. They keep water clean by filtering out pollutants and managing the amount of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that can lead to the harmful algae blooms that create “dead zones” without the oxygen needed to support aquatic life.  
Wetlands can even be created to treat wastewater processed from sewage treatment plants. The practice can avoid polluting rivers and streams while providing valuable habitat. 
But in Louisiana, the use of natural wetlands for wastewater treatment is a topic rife with controversy. 
Originally pitched as a method of coastal restoration, a natural assimilation wetland is typically an area of degraded forested swamp or marshland where disinfected treated sewage water is pumped in an effort to push away saltwater, provide nutrients for the growth of plants and trees, and reverse the sinking and eroding of the land. Louisiana’s 3 million acres of wetlands, which include coastal marshes and swamps, are lost at the rate of roughly 75 square kilometers annually and are on pace to disappear entirely within 200 years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Both federal and state regulators permit local wastewater utilities to use natural wetlands for assimilation. One of the sites, located in Breaux Bridge, began in the 1940s as the city’s solution to discharging its treated wastewater. But it wasn’t until around the 1980s when LSU scientists began using and studying assimilation wetlands as a way to rebuild Louisiana’s coast. There are now 15 such assimilation sites across the state.
Local utilities and scientists, led by wetlands ecologist John Day, believe assimilation sites have been largely successful in restoring wetlands. Day is one of the LSU researchers who spearheaded their use for coastal restoration. He founded Comite Resources, a company of environmental scientists who work on coastal restoration projects and currently monitor a few of the assimilation wetland sites.  
On the other side of the debate is Eugene Turner, emeritus professor of coastal sciences at LSU, who says assimilation is killing rather than restoring wetlands. Turner has a vocal public following, including organizations such as the Ponchartrain Conservancy and Louisiana Wildlife Federation, that has rallied around his argument: Feeding treated wastewater to Louisiana’s wetlands hurts rather than helps.
Such disagreements are a normal and even necessary part of science, but Day and his colleagues say Turner’s side is venturing outside the scientific process and lobbying state lawmakers to halt the projects in an “undemocratic” manner. 
On March 18, Turner gave a presentation to the Louisiana House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment, claiming assimilation is a failure. He urged lawmakers to defund work on the South Slough Wetland project, just south of Ponchatoula. Much of the money for it comes from federal grants. 
Six out of the nine assimilation areas LDEQ monitors passed their long-term health assessments, according to the agency’s 2024 report. Wetland health is determined in the report solely by the amount of vegetation growth at the site, called net primary productivity, evaluated over a period of five years. The South Slough Wetland is one of the six sites that passed its evaluation.

Turner’s claims received no pushback at the time because, according to Day, no other coastal scientists were invited to the hearing or even aware that the wetlands projects were up for discussion. 
Turner did the same thing at a legislative hearing last year, catching the scientific community by surprise with misleading testimony that no one got a chance to refute, Day said in an interview. 
“It’s happened twice, and it’s undemocratic,” he said. “They never alert the larger scientific community that’s interested in this.”
Turner disputed the idea he’s doing anything underhanded and accused Day of trying to protect his funding source. Comite Resources provides the monitoring services for the site, though Day said he hasn’t received a paycheck from the company in nearly 20 years. 
“What is undemocratic? Testifying at a legislative session? Speaking up with facts?” Turner said in an interview. “Is publishing in open access scientific journals undemocratic? Democracy includes public discourse in this country.”
Representatives from the Ponchartrain Conservancy and Louisiana Wildlife Federation also attended the March 18 meeting and gave testimony supporting Turner’s position to pull money back from wetland assimilation projects. While the organizations supported the idea in the past, they have since changed their stance. 
Ponchartrain Conservancy executive director Kristi Trail said she thinks Louisiana should stop issuing permits for new assimilation projects.
Both organizations cite many of Turner’s arguments and are calling for treatment plants associated with assimilation projects to improve the quality level of the water they discharge into manufactured wetland areas. They also argue that the water may need to be mixed between assimilation wetlands and an open water body in an effort to protect wetlands against long periods of exposure to extra nutrients. 
Ponchatoula state Rep. Kim Coates asked Louisiana Department of Equality Secretary Aurelia Giacometto, who was also at the March hearing, to respond to Turner’s claims. Giacometto told Coates the agency could get back to her later if she submits her questions in writing.  
Coates expressed some frustration with Giacometto’s lack of response during the hearing. She reiterated that in a phone interview several days later, saying she was “disappointed” LDEQ came to the hearing unprepared to discuss the work it has been doing. 
Giacometto was at the hearing to discuss the agency’s waste tire program. No one from the committee had asked LDEQ to prepare for a discussion on wastewater wetlands, the agency’s communications division said in an email. Coates had not yet sent questions to the agency as of April 13, according to LDEQ. 
Why Louisiana’s wetlands are disappearing
Coastal researchers say one of Louisiana’s greatest environmental threats is coastal erosion. The state has experienced significant deterioration of wetlands along its coast, eroding barrier islands that provide natural hurricane protection, threatening vital habitat for fish and wildlife and losing an ecosystem that absorbs greenhouse gases and is one of the earth’s greatest carbon sinks.
Researchers have found geological evidence that the Mississippi River went through natural cycles of flooding and course meandering prior to the construction of levees. Like the tail of a snake, the river would frequently whip back and forth, changing its position and forming new deltas across the coast roughly every millennium. 
These natural cycles created the wetlands along Louisiana’s coast. The building of levees locked the Mississippi River in place, preventing it from depositing its nutrient-rich freshwater and sediments across the region’s natural coastal plain, according to studies by LSU coastal scientists Harry Roberts and Irv Mendelssohn.  
Through their research, Day and Turner have made significant contributions to science’s general consensus on Louisiana’s land loss, which points to climate change, sea-level rise, hurricanes and various human activities such as oil drilling, canal dredging and perhaps most significantly, the building of levees. 
However, Turner agrees with only part of this theory and has spent much of his research arguing that canal dredging, above all else, is the primary cause of land loss. He points to more than 35,000 canals that have lacerated Louisiana’s coastal wetlands, with massive amounts of soil dredged away for oil and gas operations and shipping lanes.
Turner has positioned himself against the consensus’ view of how to solve Louisiana’s coastal crisis, criticizing river diversion and wetland assimilation projects as costly and ignorant. He has published papers pointing out the large amounts of taxpayer money spent on such work and arguing that backfilling dredged canals is an easier and more cost-effective solution to restore the coast. 
Day agrees that canal dredging has had a detrimental effect on the coast, but he said Turner has taken an extreme position by dismissing all the other causes of wetland loss.

Real or fake
Part of the controversy surrounding Louisiana’s wetland assimilation projects lies in the difference between natural wetlands and artificial ones constructed for sewage assimilation. 
Constructed wetlands are usually contained within a perimeter of concrete walls, making it easier for people to control the exact amount of water and nutrients that enters and exits a system. These engineered areas are used much more commonly around the world to treat wastewater. 
Louisiana is one of few places that sends wastewater effluent to natural wetlands. Florida has a similar program intended to reuse wastewater and, in some capacity, restore wetland health. Both constructed and natural wetlands are used to treat the wastewater, but natural wetlands have stricter monitoring rules and allow smaller amounts of nutrients to be discharged. 
Assimilation wetlands are similar to river diversions but on a smaller and less expensive scale, proponents say. In theory, both methods rebuild wetlands by introducing freshwater, nutrients and sediment into a degrading marsh, encouraging more plants to take root and allowing soil to accumulate over time.
Day and other supporters of natural assimilation wetlands argue resources shouldn’t be spent on expensive artificial wetland systems when those resources can be used to save the state’s natural wetlands.  
With the Mississippi River delta sinking and the sea level rising, Louisiana’s wetlands need to rise at at least the same rate to stop from disappearing, Day said.
Dr. Rachel Hunter, a wetlands ecologist with Comite Resources, said the method provides nutrients and freshwater to a hydrologically isolated wetland.
“So normally, where that water may be stagnant, you’re getting water flowing through the area, and those nutrients and that fresh water will stimulate primary productivity,” Hunter said.
If regulators were to require sewage treatment plants to provide cleaner water for assimilation wastewater, proponents say it could cause the projects to fail. Increasing treatment reduces the amount of sediment pumped into a site to rebuild the land. 
One of the most controversial assimilation sites is the South Slough Wetland just north of Pass Manchac, in Coates’ district. Owned by the city of Hammond, it opened in 2006 and almost immediately generated public suspicion because marsh deterioration occurred at the site the following year, leaving mostly standing water in the area.
The initial deterioration at the Hammond site was attributed to nutria eating the vegetation, but the site rebounded after the project managers killed more than 2,000 nutria there, Day said.
Turner, a natural assimilation wetlands critic, argues wastewater overloaded with nutrients inundates the marsh. That weakens its soil strength and speeds up the rate of plant decomposition, causing wetlands to break apart, he said. 
He dismissed claims that nutria are responsible for destroying new wetlands and doubled down on the unpredictability of a natural wetland making it hard to manage nutrient overload.
“It’s very undefined,” Turner said, adding that without restraints on how effluent enters and leaves the marsh, wastewater nutrients have overloaded the system. 
In his presentation to lawmakers on March 18, he displayed a photo of the site that showed what he said were dying trees and vegetation. Healthier looking vegetation was growing in the adjacent area north of the discharge pipe that does not receive any effluent.
The picture was taken in 2009, however, and Day accused Turner of using an outdated photograph and said he hasn’t cited any data to show that effluent or nutrients are being affected by a lack of artificial containment structures. 
The Illuminator visited the South Slough Wetland on March 20 and 25 and took drone photographs that show what appears to be thriving vegetation in the assimilation site, in contrast to mostly brown vegetation in the area north of the pipeline that does not receive wastewater. Proponents say this is a sign of the project’s success.

Where wastewater goes
Those on either side of the issue can present convincing arguments, but often lost in the debate is what might happen if the projects are shuttered.
Charles Borchers IV, Hammond’s director of administration, said the opponents of the assimilation site never talk about alternatives for disposing the city’s treated wastewater.
“A lot of people don’t understand where wastewater goes after they flush their toilet … It has to go somewhere,” Borchers said. “It’s not like it just sits at the wastewater treatment plant and just goes away.”
If not for the assimilation wetland, the city would be discharging its wastewater into a river, lake or some other body of water, he said. 
Borchers was also upset when he learned lawmakers had a hearing in which Hammond’s project was criticized and no one was there to defend it. Like Day and Hunter, city officials only learned about the hearing when they received calls from the Illuminator.  
“The city’s position is that the science is on our side,” Borchers said.
He considers the site healthy and growing and said the city has its own scientist who monitors the water quality and reports the data to LDEQ on a regular basis. 
“You can go to Google Earth and look at that area evolve over time,” Borchers said. “It’s got more vegetation, and it’s more green now than it was in 2005.”
Turner, the Louisiana Wildlife Federation and Ponchartrain Conservancy called for a full review of the natural wetland assimilation program at the legislative meeting in March, urging LDEQ to discontinue permits for natural wetlands assimilation projects. Day supported the idea of a review, saying the science supports the projects.
“I’m all in favor of it, but let’s have full involvement of everybody in there,” Day said.

Connecticut produces more trash than it can handle.
Nearly three years after dousing the flames at the state’s largest waste incinerator, officials are still searching for way to deal with the mess created by the thousands of tons of trash local residents produce each day.
For the most part, the trash that was once burned to create electricity and ash at the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority in Hartford is now being placed onto tractor-trailers and rail cars and shipped hundreds of miles away to landfills in Pennsylvania and Ohio — a costly and ecologically-damaging solution that has many critics and few fans.
And while state officials have reported some progress getting people to divert things like food scraps and plastic bottles out of the waste stream, the scale of Connecticut’s trash problem has only grown.
MIRA’s closure in 2022 resulted in 640,000 tons of trash being sent out of state that year. By the next year, Connecticut was exporting 41% of all its municipal solid waste, roughly 940,000 tons of trash, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Connecticut isn’t the only state exporting its trash. With limited space in Midwestern landfills, the state’s municipalities and haulers are facing rising rates to ship trash beyond its borders. Those costs get passed along to Connecticut residents through taxes and collection fees, according to DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes. 
“It is escalating and it’s going to escalate over time,” Dykes said. “The crisis is in the sense that we need to take urgent action, because developing new programs, new solutions to regain self sufficiency and replace that disposal capacity that the MIRA plan represented, takes time.”

Finding — and funding — a plan
The trash problem has also befuddled state lawmakers, who have been largely unsuccessful in their efforts to pass a long-term solution.
Two years ago, municipal leaders objected to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont that would have charged cities and towns up to $5 for every ton of trash they ship out of state, in order to raise money to help build new facilities capable of handling trash within the state. Instead, lawmakers settled on a plan to authorize up to $500 million in bonding, through the Connecticut Green Bank, should the state ever settle on a plan to build a new waste-to-energy facility. That money remains unspent.
The latest attempt to address the issue this year, House Bill 6917, takes a more modest approach.
The legislation would charge a fee of $1.50 on every ton of waste shipped out of state. Currently, that fee is only being applied to waste that is burned at the state’s four remaining waste-to-energy facilities. In addition, it removes language within state law that diverts up to $2.8 million collected each year from those existing fees into the state’s general fund. Instead, all of that money would go to a sustainable materials management account where it is earmarked for local waste-reduction projects.
“What we’re trying to do in this bill is actually to get parity between waste that’s processed in and out of state, so that we get a bit more money into that program,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who is leading the legislature’s efforts on waste this session as co-chair of the Environment Committee.
The bill would also require that large producers of food waste — including supermarkets, wholesalers, food manufacturers and conference centers — adopt their own written policy for the donation of excess food, further reducing what they throw away.
“We’re going backwards, right?”Julianna Larue, the Sierra Club
Critics of the legislation, however, argue that adding fees wouldn’t serve as an incentive to handle trash in-state if there’s nowhere to put it. Beyond Connecticut’s existing waste-to-energy facilities, recycling centers and a handful of composting options, the state has no permanent, active landfills accepting household trash.
“You’re trying to collect money. Let’s have a plan first, and then we can talk about about funding that plan,” said Brian O’Connor, the director of public policy for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. “There’s no long-term strategy from [DEEP] at this point.”
In written testimony filed on an early version of the bill, Lewis Dubuque of the National Waste and Recycling Association questioned whether the fee would be applied to other materials beyond municipal solid waste that are disposed of at incinerators or shipped out of state. 
“In any event, such a fee will naturally be passed on to the customer and, given the claims that the disposal of material is becoming more expensive in challenging fiscal times, the NWRA questions why the imposition of a new fee on the consumer is warranted,” Dubuque said. Dubuque did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.
For environmental advocates, the bill represents an initial step toward reducing the amount of trash being shipped across state lines to slowly decompose in a landfill, which many see as the worst possible solution. 
“If you think about diesel trucks and how much greenhouse gas emissions they’re emitting every single day driving from central Connecticut to Ohio and Pennsylvania, that is a significant amount of carbon dioxide, and it’s not moving us towards our our climate change goals that we set for ourselves,” said Julianna Larue, an organizer with the Sierra Club. “We’re going backwards, right?”
In addition to the climate considerations, residents who live in the vicinity of those landfills have said they’re fed up dealing with the smell. In some cases they’ve even pushed to close the facilities.
Lawmakers are also weighing other proposals this session intended to reduce the amount of waste produced in Connecticut and the associated environmental impacts.
House Bill 6229 would ban single-use plastics and polystyrene containers, which critics argue clog up the waste stream, starting in 2026. Past efforts to ban or phase out those plastics have failed in the face of opposition from the restaurant and hospitality industry. Another, Senate Bill 80, seeks to place tougher standards on the burning of medical waste following complaints from residents living close to a waste-to-energy facility in Bristol.
All three bills have passed out of the Environment Committee and are either awaiting fiscal review or have been referred to the Appropriations Committee. 
Parker said he expects H.B. 6917 to generate between $1 million and $3 million a year for waste diversion efforts. That’s far less than what Lamont’s original 2023 legislation would have raised — an estimated $11 million. 
“The truth is that some of these projects, you know, cost a lot of money,” Parker said. “We’re going to be reasonable about what’s going to be funded here. It’s not going to be the be-all, end-all to the solution.”

Pilot programs
Barring a plan to build any major new waste-processing facilities in Connecticut, efforts to confront the trash problem have mostly focused on getting specific items such as food scraps and plastic out of the waste stream.
To that end, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection last month awarded $15 million in grants to nine municipalities to fund infrastructure projects related to recycling and composting.
In New Haven, for example, the city plans to build a new $3.3 million sorting facility at the transfer station, within the footprint of the old incinerator.
Starting in 2027, officials will distribute colored, biodegradable trash bags to residents on local garbage routes, instructing those residents to fill the bags with compostable materials like leftover scraps of food or coffee grounds. The bags will be picked up from curbside bins along with other garbage on trash day, then taken to the local sorting station. Once sorted, the organic waste will be sent off to a digester facility to be turned into biogas, and, eventually, compost.
The goal, officials say, is to divert roughly one-fifth of the city’s residential trash — the heavy, soggy and dense food scraps — away from Connecticut’s overloaded municipal waste stream.
“Most of the trash here … goes to Bridgeport and is burned,” Mayor Justin Elicker said during a press conference announcing the project earlier this month. “That is clearly not the best solution for compostable materials that could be used for such better purposes.”
If it is successful, New Haven’s program will follow on the heels of larger cities such as New York which began a mandatory composting program on April 1.

In an attempt to encourage towns to find innovative ways to reduce their solid waste stream, lawmakers created the sustainable materials management account in 2022. Since then, the program has awarded about $5.2 million in funding for local pilot programs focused on organics diversion and pricing models that charge residents based on the amount of trash they throw away.
Some of those pilots have already concluded with DEEP officials reporting promising results. Between 2021 and 2023, Connecticut saw a 368% increase in food scrap diversion, with 37,549 tons of waste sent for composting in the latter year.
Several towns including Middletown, Woodbury, Madison, Kent and others have also opted to continue their program beyond the pilot period, according to DEEP. 
Speaking to reporters in New Haven last month, Dykes said lessons from those pilots informed state officials as they were reviewing applications for the most recent round of infrastructure grants — which included the New Haven sorting facility, a food-waste collection program in Manchester and a commercial-scale composting facility in southeastern Connecticut. In addition to the nine projects that were selected for funding, Dykes said a dozen other applications were submitted.
“It just goes to show how many communities and municipalities are really leaning into finding these solutions and want to implement common-sense solutions to recycle and divert organics,” Dykes said. “And so we’re hopeful that this will just be the beginning of more funding rounds.”
Still, some officials overseeing the handling of municipal waste say that local grant-funded programs do not go far enough to address the full scale of the state’s waste issues.
Jennifer Heaton-Jones, the executive director of western Connecticut’s Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority, said that lawmakers needed to take a more “holistic” approach to addressing the issue including better education campaigns, requiring towns to offer access to food scrap diversion programs and expanding capacity to handle waste locally. 
“This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior and making better decisions about material management, from their homes to the curb to the transfer station,” she said. 
Heaton-Jones did praise some aspects of the legislation drafted by lawmakers this year, including $500,000 to help DEEP enforce a law requiring large producers of food waste to utilize composting facilities and $250,000 to support an informational campaign run by the Recycle CT Foundation.
“I feel like we’re not going to solve the waste issue with the state, obviously, with this bill,” Heaton-Jones said. “I mean, there’s some good things in it… but we need more than that.”
H.B. 6917 also requires that DEEP study the feasibility of a proposal to make the manufacturers of consumer packaging pay for some or all of the costs of handling that material once it’s thrown away — also known as extended producer responsibility. Connecticut has EPR programs in place for hard-to-recycle items such as mattresses, tires and mercury thermostats, and advocates argue that the ubiquitous presence of packaging in the waste stream has exacerbated the state’s existing trash problems.
“This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior .”Jennifer Heaton-Jones, Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority
That proposal, even as a study, drew objections from waste haulers and recyclers who argued DEEP should first update its nearly decade-old survey of all the material that ends up in Connecticut’s waste stream.
The ranking Republican on the Environment Committee, state Rep. Pat Callahan, R-New Fairfield, echoed those concerns at a meeting last month when he said lawmakers should wait for the results of a new assessment before they “figure out what further work needs to be done.”
To address some of those concerns, Parker said the language in the bill was adjusted to postpone the packaging study by a year, so it would coincide with DEEP‘s next waste characterization study.
“The big picture is we’re just continuing to move this conversation forward,” Parker said, calling the bill “a work in progress.”
State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, compared the current crisis to the situation facing Connecticut in the late 1980s, when she served as chair of the Environment Committee. At the time, aging landfills such as Hartford’s notorious “Mount Trashmore” served as eyesores and sources of pollution in local drinking water.
To close the landfills, Connecticut implemented a mandatory recycling law in 1991 and partnered with private companies to build its network of waste-to-energy facilities with enough capacity to burn as much trash as the state could produce, without needing to import more trash from elsewhere to stay profitable.
Lawmakers also established a $1-per-ton fee — later raised to $1.50 — on trash sent to those facilities to support their continued operations. That system, she said, worked for nearly three decades until the age of the facilities and the diversion of revenues from fees into the state’s general fund caused them to close or reduce their output.
By expanding the fee to trash shipped out of state and using it to fund compost and recycling programs, Mushinsky said she believes Connecticut can again reach a point where it can handle whatever trash is left over, whether through waste-to-energy incineration or some other emerging technology.
“It’s not rocket science, you just need money to do it,” Mushinsky said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0410_SR_TrashCenter_127-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-13 05:01:58.449526

On my desk is a printing block from one of the Little Blue Books, produced in the millions by the Haldeman-Julius plant in Girard, Kansas. It’s a chunk of metal and wood, and it still has black ink crusted around its reverse characters. Numbered 1020 in the series and used to print the title page of a 1926 essay by iconoclast botanist Luther Burbank, the block is a piece of history speaking from the dead but not yet distant past.
It is a bit of permanence in an increasingly ethereal world of thought.
More on that later.
I picked up the printing block during my first year or so as a reporter for the Pittsburg Morning Sun, a small daily in Southeast Kansas. I don’t recall exactly where the block came from, but I likely bought it at some yard sale, because in those days it wasn’t uncommon to find jetsam from the old Haldeman-Julius publishing empire.
Beginning in 1919, the plant began churning out the Little Blue Books for mail-order at a few cents each, a “university in print.” The little books were the creation of Emanuel Julius, who was just 26 when he stepped off the train at Girard. An Eastern intellectual and writer with no formal education, and the second generation of an immigrant Ukrainian Jewish family, Julius must have seemed an odd character to the town’s residents. As a reporter, he had covered the New York Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, in which 146 mostly immigrant workers died. Now he had come to join the staff of The Appeal to Reason, the largest socialist newspaper in the country.
I remember local historian Gene DeGruson first telling me the story of the Appeal to Reason, and of the coal mining area’s rich history of socialism. The newspaper was founded by J.A. Wayland, who had relocated the weekly from Kansas City, Missouri, to cut costs.  Socialism was a significant American movement from its roots in the utopian communities of the 19th century through the presidential campaigns of Eugene V. Debs, who was convicted and imprisoned for sedition late in life. During World War I, the socialist movement — which had been strongly anti-military — began to wane.
Meanwhile, Emanuel Julius had married Marcet Haldeman, the free-thinking, wealthy and writerly daughter of a local banker. At the suggestion of Marcet’s aunt, the social reformer Jane Addams, the couple hyphenated their names.
In 1917, the Appeal was sold to Emanual and Marcet Haldeman-Julius, and the couple reimagined the newspaper for a new progressive era. Emanuel also embarked on a publishing venture that he had thought about since he was a teenager and “The Ballad of Reading Gaol” had sustained him during a cold winter’s day. His goal was to bring classics of literature to the masses in pocket-sized editions at an affordable price. In 1919, the Haldeman-Julius plant began publishing the little books. They originally had red covers, but eventually Haldeman-Julius settled on blue covers, and Oscar Wilde’s long poem would become No. 2 in the series.
The price? A nickel. By mail order.
The Little Blue Books, which preceded mass market paperbacks by a decade or two, were an unqualified success. They were carried in the pockets of hobos, working people, and aspiring writers from Saul Bellow to Louis L’Amour. E. Haldeman-Julius bolstered the classic (and royalty-free) books with new material and often used suggestive or shocking titles for appeal. No. 1402, by Arkansas socialist Clay Fulks, is “How I Went to the Devil.” No. 907, by researcher William J. Fielding, is “Sexual Obsessions of Saints and Mystics.” Collectively, the little books sold in the hundreds of millions, making E. and Marcet Haldeman-Julius not only rich, but also famous.
The couple collaborated on an ambitious set of literary projects, including the novel “Dust.” Published in 1921 by Brentano’s, New York, the work was hailed as an important work of American realistic fiction.
In his 2017 biography of E. Haldeman-Julius, historian R. Alton Lee argues that from 1920 to 1950, Girard was the “literary and publishing Mecca of the United States, and thus the international center for Western civilization.” At the height of his success, E. Haldeman-Julius knew every major author, many of the minor ones, and even if the important political figures of the day didn’t speak to him directly, they read his books. His life, Lee said, was full of scandal, disappointment, and ultimately tragedy.
What E. Haldeman-Julius left behind was a publishing and marketing revolution that changed us, a revolution that made available to every working man and woman the greatest thinkers of every age, including their own. The evidence is in the printing plates and the millions of books they produced, which are collected and catalogued by universities but which you can still find at yard sales across the country.
I was reminded of the value of non-volatile media the other day when I went to a used vinyl record store in Lawrence and redeemed a gift certificate from a friend. The place was not quaint, but authentic. The ancient floors creaked underfoot, and a shop cat roamed at will. One of the things I found was something I hadn’t realized I needed: a 1966 LP entitled “Whistle Echoes of the Ohio and Mississippi River Steamboats, Vol. 2.” One of my current writing projects is about a steamboat plying rivers of the American West.
The record has such treasures as “the plaintive call of the KATIE STOCKDALE” and the steam calliope of the “DELTA QUEEN.” The album features extensive notes, including this: “The joy of this record is that the performers who blow the whistles, sing the songs and play the music are exuberant rivermen and shore watchers along the willow-fringed winding channels of the Mississippi River System.”
Yes, I am such a research nerd that this $3 LP was the cherry on top of a good day. There was pleasure holding it in my hands, of reading the copy, of not having to deal with a menu or a scroll bar to navigate its secrets. But there was something else that occurred to me on the drive home.
There were no advertisements jiggling on the screen, no pop-ups to block, and no algorithm attempting to predict what I was most likely to buy or click on next. I had found the album by good old-fashioned browsing, not the kind you do on a device. I did not have to fight unseen agents attempting to steer my attention to other products, other sites, other candidates.
It felt like freedom.
The album was inviolable.
Like a newspaper or a magazine or a book, the album could be crushed or shredded or burned, but short of destruction its contents could not easily be altered. As we venture further into our current dystopian landscape, I suspect this resistance to alteration will prove an advantage. In past weeks, government websites have been scrubbed to conform to political orthodoxy. The malleable nature of the web makes it easy to remove historical references that might fall under the forbidden category of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Mentions of transgender and queer people were struck, for example, from a National Park Service web page for the Stonewall monument in New York.
Such straightwashing is mandated by executive order.
For better or worse, we live in a digital age, and our perception of reality is created by what appears on our screens. It is appalling to us now that the government is scrubbing official content in this way, but I suspect we could acclimate quickly. There are, of course, archives that store past versions of web pages, but browsing is difficult. You have to know what you’re looking for. Think your digital content is safe? You can’t even archive your Kindle library anymore, because Amazon now prevents downloads to your computer of the books you’ve already bought. Your content automatically changes to reflect updates — or deletions. We don’t own digital content, we just rent it.
If you want to keep something, you’d better buy the actual book.
Making a connection with a physical book is a reminder that you and it are of the world. There is comfort in the feel and smell and heft of books, new and old. They were our first mass medium and they remain vital in communicating important, world-changing ideas. Most of us can readily name the handful of books that shaped our lives. Near the top of my list is 1975’s “The Monkey Wrench Gang.”
Yes,  this seems an old-fashioned idea, this longing for physical media, and just what you’d expect from a writer who advocates for AM radio and old stereo receivers. But the danger posed by cultural amnesia is real, and social media has far too much influence on current politics.
Barbara F. Walters, author of “How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them,” has said that since social media emerged in 2010, the number of global democracies have decreased. To help prevent civil wars, she said, social media should be regulated. It’s not that people shouldn’t be allowed to post whatever they want, she argues, but that tech companies shouldn’t be allowed to push extreme material to wide audiences.
“People ask me: ‘What’s the single easiest thing that the United States could do to reduce our risk of civil war?’ And my answer is always the same,” she said in an interview cited by Business Insider. “Regulate social media.”
The history of mass media has always been turbulent, right back to the invention of the printing press and the explosion of literacy that created the modern world. In many ways, the challenges we face today are similar, but with a significant difference: The Gutenberg revolution did not have unseen agents behind each page manipulating readers for attention. A thirst for knowledge was motivation enough to turn each page.
We have failed to use new technologies responsibly — both as creators and as consumers. Never mind the easy access to pornography, as that has been with us at the start of just about every media revolution. No, it’s the malleability of new media that invites authoritarians to purge or discourage “improper ideology” that is the real danger.
If we cannot stem the shifting sand of new media, we will be buried by it.
I don’t know what E. Haldeman-Julius would make of our current situation, but I’ll bet he would recruit the best writers to offer commentary. In his time, he had Will Durant and Upton Sinclair in his stable. Perhaps in a future time a scholar will sift through the digital remains of our age and note a few voices still worth listening to, even on something as old-fashioned as a Web page.
The undoing of E. Haldeman-Julius began in February 1948, when a couple of small-time crooks broke into the printing plant in Girard. The thieves, Raymond Lee and his older brother, Joseph, found a tin can in which Haldeman-Julius had hidden $40,218 in currency and silver. That would be like stealing half a million in today’s money.
Haldeman-Julius reported the theft to the police. He was then investigated for tax fraud, because he had claimed an income of far less in preceding years. During his trial, in 1951, his defense attorney claimed his self-taught client knew little about accounting. “Nobody but a writer,” the Associated Press reported the attorney as saying, “would keep $40,000 in a tin can safe.”
Haldeman-Julius was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to six months in prison. He and Marcet had divorced in 1933; she died eight years later, age 51. Emanuel married Susan Haney, a secretary in the publishing office.
Out on bond while awaiting appeal, Haldeman-Julius was found dead in the swimming pool of his home July 31, 1951. He was 62. Unlike Gatsby, he had died of natural causes. The age of the Little Blue Books had passed, but the printing plant in Girard kept limping along until 1978, when a presumed bottle rocket burned it to the ground.
The Haldeman-Julius legacy remains, an inviolable record for future generations. Scattered in university collections and the homes and minds and hearts of the curious and the bookish, it endures as a testament to where we’ve been. The canon is both sacred and profane, trash and treasure, a curious mix of socialism and capitalism.
In other words, it’s like us. Who we were — and who we are now, and what we hope to become — is worth preserving. No matter how much others may want us to forget.
Some things are worth holding on to.

If you’re upset with ICE’s deportations, isn’t your anger better directed at them?","Connecticut’s favorite local airline, Avelo, is in trouble for making a strategic business decision: taking a long-term contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fly deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security.
Starting in May they’re dedicating three of their 20 737 jets to fly from Mesa, Ariz. to destinations both in the U.S. and overseas (presumably flying over the “Gulf of America”) possibly even heading to El Salvador to deliver deportees to prisons there. 


The public reaction, while understandable, is misplaced.
Avelo has enjoyed amazing success flying out of New Haven’s Tweed airport, growing from 50,000 passengers in 2019 to a current 600,000 happy flyers. They fly to 31 different destinations and have recently added flights from Bradley International airport.
The convenience of flying from a local airport and the super-low fares have made Avelo immensely popular, so the deal with ICE has some fans upset. It’s almost as if Patagonia took a contract to design prison guard uniforms: it’s way “off brand.”
But remember, Avelo is a common carrier airline. Their business is flying planes, not passing judgement on passengers or destinations.
They’ve flown hundreds of charter flights for everything from sports teams to tour groups. They’ve even flown deportation flights for ICE during the Biden administration… and nobody complained.
In fact, Avelo started as a charter airline, Casino Express (later renamed as Xtra Airlines), ferrying gamblers to Nevada. They even provided charters for the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016. This is their business: flying.
Avelo has been receiving financial support from the state in the form of a tax exemption on its aviation fuel. The City of New Haven has been fawning over them as a hometown success story (even though the airline is officially headquartered in Texas). But all that has now changed.
Now there are calls for a passenger boycott and financial penalties. But hey… isn’t this anger misplaced?
If you’re upset with ICE’s deportations, isn’t your anger better directed at them? Where are the legal appeals? Penalizing or boycotting Avelo won’t stop the deportations. 
There are many U.S.-flagged airlines taking the ICE charter contracts, including the reinvented Eastern Airlines which converted a 767 used for the New England Patriots to handle deportations to Brazil and Venezuela.
Avelo says this deal with ICE was a business decision. Though profitable, Avelo (like other no-frills airlines) pinches pennies. They don’t fly everywhere, every day… only on the heavier travel days when they can pack their planes and make a buck.
Taking on the ICE charters, they say, is a way of subsidizing their low fares as we face an economic recession and keeping their employees on payroll. In fact, they’re looking to hire new flight attendants for their Mesa, Ariz. operations, paying $28 an hour.
If protesters would “read the room” they’d realize that many of Avelo’s passengers probably support the deportations. After all, President Trump is only doing what he promised and what got him elected.
As I’ve said before, Americans deserve the government they elect.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SRR_Avelo-protest040925_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-13 05:01:58.449526

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia lawmakers wrapped up the legislative session Saturday, completing action on 247 of the 2,460 bills that were introduced over 60 days. 
Overall, the 2025 legislative session was marked by party disagreements within the GOP supermajority as well as tension between lawmakers and Gov. Patrick Morrisey. Lawmakers and Morrisey first disagreed on whether the state was facing a $400 million budget deficit, then many of his priority bills were shot down.
Despite that, in a news release hours before sine die, Morrisey said his agenda was approved by the West Virginia Legislature. 
“When I took office just three months ago, I promised to address West Virginia’s challenges head on, bringing the type of change that moves the needle and invigorates our state,” the Republican governor said.
Morrisey’s State of the State address — as well as multiple executive orders levied in his first few days in office — gave lawmakers pretty clear insight into what policy priorities — like religious exemptions to the state’s strict childhood vaccine laws and a ban on diversity programs in state government — the new governor wanted to see passed in his first legislative session.
But getting those policies across the finish line proved challenging and, in some cases, unsuccessful. 
Swift action on ‘defining gender’ bill
The GOP-led Legislature swiftly passed Morrisey’s bill that will for the first time define the terms “man” and “woman” in state code by a person’s biological sex. It was the first priority to make it the governor’s desk, and he held a ceremonial bill signing with former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines, who has spoken out against trans women in sports. 
The measure, Senate Bill 456, will also restrict transgender individuals’ access to spaces like bathrooms or locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
There is no empirical evidence to support claims that trans people commit harassment or assault against others when using bathrooms or facilities that align with their gender identity. Instead, people who are trans are more likely to be victims of such attacks when forced to use facilities that don’t match their gender identity.
Certificate of Need repeal dies early 
Morrisey’s push for repealing the Certificate of Need process in the state died early in the session when the House Committee on Health and Human Resources — on Feb. 24 — voted against House Bill 2007, meaning it never went to the floor for a full vote.
HB 2007 was one of the first tests for Morrisey’s influence in the Legislature, and specifically among members of the House. Several lawmakers who held concerns about repealing the certificate of need process told members of the media, in interviews and elsewhere, that they did not appreciate the strategies employed by the governor and his staff while they attempted to whip votes in support of the legislation.
“[Completely repealing CON] is one of the governor’s priority bills, but the governor is trying to, for lack of better words, force people to vote his way just because it’s his way and sending people around, pulling people out of committees to talk to them, to try to get them to switch their vote — we’ve gotten off to a bad start,” said Del. Scot Heckert, R-Wood, said on HD Media’s Outside the Echo Chamber in February. “… When you start telling people what to do ‘or else’ — especially West Virginia people — that doesn’t go very well.”
A month later, Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, attempted to discharge the bill from the Health Committee and to the House floor. After a brief fight over rules and constitutionality of that motion, the full House voted in support of discharging the bill. Ultimately, however, members voted 74-16, effectively killing repeal of CON a second and final time this session.
Meanwhile, the Senate never moved on their version of a bill to do the same.
Childhood vaccines most controversial issue this session
Like CON, Morrisey’s attempt to water down the state’s vaccine requirements petered out, dealing another blow to the governor’s list of priorities.
SBl 460 would have allowed religious exemptions for the state’s school vaccine requirements and revised the process by which families get medical exemptions for the requirements. 
The Senate passed the bill with a vote of 20-2, but the House of Delegates voted it down 42 to 56. The Senate Health Committee earlier this week amended the language of the bill into HB 2776, which requires the state to report positive tests for Alpha-gal, a tickborne allergic condition, to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amendment was withdrawn Thursday. 
The state has been one of only five that allow only medical exemptions to school immunization requirements. Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. The state health department has said it will comply with Morrisey’s executive order even though the Legislature didn’t pass the bill. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion ban passed in final minutes 
The bill to ban nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in West Virginia state government passed the House and Senate in the final hours of the session, with the Senate making its final decision on the bill with less than minutes to go Saturday night. 
SB 474, which is the legislative side of an executive order posed by Morrisey that bans offering specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex. It’s reflective of a trend spearheaded by Republicans nationwide meant to undermine and end DEI in all its forms. 
The bill only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education. 
It passed the state Senate 32-2 on March 26, when Republican proponents for it alleged that such services shouldn’t exist because “we don’t need [them] anymore.” They said that while issues like racism may be real, they are no longer a problem in West Virginia. Systemic racism and sexism, however, are unequivocally still present in West Virginia and the United States as a whole.
When the bill came up for consideration in the House on Saturday evening, there were 27 amendments — 24 filed by Democrats and three from Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, were pending on the legislation — awaiting consideration. After hours of going through the amendments the House eventually signed off on the legislation.
When the Senate went to concur on the House’s amendments, Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, filed multiple amendments on the bill, but the Senate enacted unclear parliamentary procedures to side-step the typical process of taking up amendments. Garcia and Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, attempted to speak on the bill but their efforts were blocked. 
The Senate passed the bill in the last 10 minutes of the session. Garcia and Woelfel voted no on the measure.
Bill for microgrids, data centers sparks long debates
HB 2014, which would create a certified microgrid program in the state for data centers that lawmakers hope will locate here, was a late addition to Morrisey’s legislative agenda. The bill was introduced by request of Morrisey on March 18 — more than halfway through the 2025 regular session. 
The bill was subject to dozens of amendments as it made its way through both the House and the Senate, including changes to how taxes collected on data centers would be distributed, policies regarding how microgrids would operate and requirements for those microgrids as well as other utilities. The bill initially passed the House on April 1. After more changes in the Senate, lawmakers there approved their version on April 11.
Those who voted against HB 2014 in both chambers shared concerns over the potential for electric rate increases if the bill were to pass. They also voiced discontent with measures that removed local control and enforcement of certain regulations for counties and municipalities where data centers could be built.
On the last night of session, even more adjustments came in the legislation, which changed the tax structure for any data centers that are located in West Virginia, among other things.
The two chambers did find compromise on that version of the bill, with the House passing the amended version 82-16 with two members absent and not voting. The Senate concurred with the House’s changes to the legislation Saturday evening and voted yet again to pass the legislation, sending it to Morrisey’s desk for signage.
The Legislature also completed legislation on SB 458, which allows licensed and certified professionals to practice in West Virginia without taking additional examinations to attain local licensure or certification. Morrisey signed the bill, calling it a “huge step forward to make West Virginia more competitive, attract jobs and workers, and grow opportunities for both current and future residents.”
Lawmakers approve Morrisey’s classroom cell phone ban
In his State of State, Morrisey called for teacher pay raises as West Virginia’s public school teachers are the least paid in the nation. He never requested a bill that could have implemented a raise. 
He did, however, push a measure passed by both chambers, HB 2003, that would limit the use of personal electronic devices like cell phones in school classrooms during instructional time. If counties permit students to bring a cell phone on school property, counties are tasked with developing their own policies. Students may be required to store the devices in containers or pouches provided by the county.
Lawmakers also passed HB2755 that would give lawmakers the ability to review or challenge West Virginia Board of Education polices — even though citizens soundly rejected that in a statewide vote in 2022. Opponents of the legislation have said it is unconstitutional and likely to be challenged before the state Supreme Court. 
Another high-profile education measure, SB 199, would bolster elementary school teachers’ ability to remove disruptive and violent students passed the Senate and House. The measure, two years in the making, was a top request from West Virginia teachers who said worsening student behavior — particularly among the state’s youngest learners — impeded their ability to teach. 
Other bills

 Bills targeted election fraud, voting


Numerous bills relating to campaigns and elections, as well as governmental functions generally, were considered by lawmakers this session. Some related to financing in elections while others implemented changes on how residents can vote and who, under certain terms, is allowed to run for office.
The state is poised to tighten its laws on acceptable forms of photo identification that can be used at West Virginia polling places. HB 3016, meant to address voter fraud and bolster secure elections, would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. 
Lawmakers completed legislation on SB 50, requiring municipalities to hold their elections on the same date as statewide elections, on Saturday night. In the final version, cities would have until 2032 to align their elections with those by the state. 
They also enacted SB 490, which prohibits rank-choice voting in the state. The bill was marked by Republican Secretary of State Kris Warner as a priority for his office before session began in February, even though rank-choice voting does not occur in the state..
A bill regarding absentee ballots — HB 2117 — died after passing in the House when the Senate did not take it up. The bill would have set a deadline of 7:30 p.m. on Election Day for absentee ballots to be received and prohibited people or entities from sending absentee ballot applications to people who did not ask for them.
And — in a rare move this session — Republican lawmakers in the House joined with Democrats in rejecting HB 2719, which would have allowed businesses and corporations in the state to directly donate up to $2,800 to political candidates. The body voted 54-41 against the bill. 
HB 3412, a bill that would have revised the state’s Freedom of Information Act, passed in both chambers, but died after the House of Delegates did not take up a message to concur on the Senate’s changes to the legislation. 

 Most foster care, substance abuse bills died


There were a number of foster care bills, many a year in the making, that were meant to address widespread problems in the state’s overburdened child welfare system currently serving more than 6,000 kids.
The majority of those measures never made it up for a vote or failed to complete legislative action, but HB 2880 – an omnibus bill that brought together several foster care measures — passed the House and Senate through negotiations Saturday night. A part of the bill would create a “Parent Resource Navigator” to assist a parent to be unified or reunified with their child. 
A slew of bills were introduced this year that would have drastically changed what services are available to people who use drugs or who are in recovery from substance use disorder. 
Despite early movement, most of those ended up stalling out in committees without being taken up for serious consideration — including two bills to ban and limit syringe service programs, a bill to ban opioid treatment programs and add a tax to lifesaving Narcan in order to fund a “tip line” for people who provide tips that allow law enforcement to prosecute trafficking crimes.
Perhaps the most impactful piece of drug legislation that was adopted this year was SB 196, which introduces mandatory minimum sentences into state code for transporting cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into West Virginia. The bill also removes alternative sentencing options — like probation or home confinement — for those who are jailed on those charges.
The legislation was adopted by the Senate on March 11. Lawmakers in the House amended the bill, changing how drugs would be weighed to determine penalties and also removing a provision saying someone would have to be aware of fentanyl being present in their drugs to be charged under certain parts of the code. The amended version passed the House on April 11 and the Senate accepted the House’s changes to the law the next day.  
While abortion in the state is already illegal except in rare circumstances, the Senate passed SB 85, which would have targeted out-of-state health care providers and others who send abortion-causing medication to people in West Virginia, except when it’s legal. The bill died after the House of Delegates did not take it up. 
The House Health and Human Resources Committee considered but never passed HB 2350, which would have prohibited food stamp recipients from using their benefits to purchase soft drinks and candy.
Morrisey signed a bill that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches. The measure, HB 2354 received heavy pushback from the food and beverage industry, who say it will raise prices for many drinks and shelf-stable foods. The ban on dyes in school food is set to take effect in August, and the rest of the ban will take effect in 2028. 

 Camping ban bill failed 


An attempt to pass a statewide camping ban aimed at homeless people failed after the Senate moved HB 2382 to the rules committee and never put it back on the calendar for a vote. The legislation passed in the House with a 89 to 9 vote. 
The bill, which wasn’t a priority for Morrisey, would have imposed fines of up to $500 and up to 30 days in jail for people who use camping paraphernalia — including tarps, cots, beds, sleeping bags, blankets, mattresses, hammocks or portable cooking facilities and similar equipment — on governmental or public property, grounds or lawns. 
The Senate Health Committee considered but never passed SB 614, which would have allowed pharmacists in the state to sell ivermectin for human use over the counter and without a prescription. The bill hinged upon the federal Food and Drug Administration approving the drug — which is commonly prescribed for animals to treat some parasites — for human use in wider circumstances than currently allowed.  

 Weakening child labor laws


The Legislature completed legislation on SB 427, which would repeal the requirement that 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment have a work permit.
The minimum legal age to work in West Virginia is 14. Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent. Under the bill, employers seeking to hire the teenagers would be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. Proponents of the legislation say it simplifies the process for teens seeking employment. Opponents say that work permits are important to help ensure compliance with child labor laws.

Anitra Hamilton, D-Monongalia, gave a passionate speech about diversity, equity and inclusion during the final night of the legislative session on the House floor on Saturday, April 12, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett |West Virginia Legislative Photography)Through what Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, called “dirty tricks” in the last 30 minutes of the 2025 regular session, Republican lawmakers in the Senate passed a bill Saturday to ban nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state of West Virginia.
The bill passed the House at 10:41 p.m. after nearly three hours of debate.
When the bill advanced to the Senate, 13 amendments from Garcia appeared to be pending on the legislation. 
Then, confusion reigned.
Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, made a motion to suspend legislative Joint Rule 3 — a rule that governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers. That motion was adopted and the Senate then concurred with and passed the House’s version of the bill 31-2 without any consideration of Garcia’s amendments.
After a short break — and as several attorneys and the chamber’s parliamentarian gathered at Senate President Randy Smith’s podium — Tarr withdrew his initial motion to suspend legislative Joint Rule 3 due to a technical error. The vote would need to be done again.
Another member then moved the previous question to consider the Joint Rule 3 motion again and concur with and pass the House’s version of Senate Bill 474. Again, the Senate voted 31-2 approving the bill.
As motion after confusing motion was considered, the microphones for both Garcia and Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell — the lone no votes on the bill — were muted while they attempted to call points of order on Tarr’s motions as well as Smith’s rulings.
In an interview after the chaos, Smith, R-Preston, said he also didn’t quite understand the legislative procedures that led to the passage of SB 474. His job, he said, is to preside over the body and the process, but other people tell him what is within the rules and not.
“This was a procedure I’ve never seen in my 13 years in the House or the Senate,” Smith said “… We have a parliamentarian who knows the rules very well, probably better than anybody in the Senate. Sen. Tarr knows the procedure very well … As far as I’m concerned, as the procedure and rules, everything was in order.”
If it wasn’t, Smith said, someone will need to challenge the law’s legitimacy in court. But for now, it heads to Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk for approval.
Garcia, in an interview after the Senate adjourned Sine Die for the session, said he believed there is a “legal deficiency” in the legislation.
“I have questions whether this bill actually did pass,” Garcia said. “… [Republicans in the Senate] will take short cuts, break rules, whatever it takes to get their agenda passed.” 
Senate Bill 474 bans the offering of specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex.
The bill only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education.
Garcia’s attempt to hold up the bill came after his colleagues in the House — mostly Democrats — employed similar tactics. There, 27 amendments were filed by lawmakers. Just three of those were adopted.
Those voted down included moves to include the Crown Act — a policy banning discrimination based on hairstyles and textures — in the bill, as well as adding nondiscrimination measures based on political beliefs and exempting parts of the bill from applying to veterans, among other measures.
Democrats in the body gave fiery speeches against the overall bill, namely Del. Anitra Hamilton, D-Monongalia, who is one of just three Black lawmakers in the state Legislature. 
Hamilton told her colleagues that DEI measures are not about giving people of color or other classes special treatment; they’re about ensuring everyone has equal ability to apply for and access the same opportunities.
She shared her experiences dealing with system racism in West Virginia and, specifically, at the Legislature. Her points were echoed by her colleagues, Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, and Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, who are also Black.
Not recognizing the existence of racism or sexism, Hamilton said, will only hold West Virginia back.
“Diversity, equity and inclusion matters,” Hamilton said. “If we don’t embrace these principles, we don’t have a bone in the race of this Backyard Brawl. We’ll continue to lose every year … I just pray that we can not only abolish this legislation, we can abolish the mentality and ideology that goes along with it, and the energy.”

(Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images)Organized labor secured a major win Saturday as Democrats in the state House pushed through legislation to provide striking workers in Washington with unemployment benefits.
But union leaders were not all smiles afterward. The bill was amended on the floor to impose a four-week limit on receiving benefits, eight weeks less than the version approved in the Senate.
Senate Bill 5041 passed the House on a 52-43 vote with seven Democrats joining Republicans in voting against the measure.
The Senate must now decide if it will agree with the revisions or insist on its position. When the bill came up for a vote last month, Senate Democrats narrowly defeated an amendment for a four-week limit before passing the bill 28-21.
New Jersey and New York are the only states with such provisions for striking workers. Oregon lawmakers are debating legislation this year that would offer unemployment benefits to striking workers there.
On Saturday, Democratic lawmakers said the bill ensures workers who choose to walk off the job will be less stressed about going without pay and seeing their finances erode in a lengthy dispute. With the threat of economic hardship eased, workers will be in a better position to endure lengthy negotiations.
“Fundamentally, this takes a step to level the playing field for striking workers,” said Rep. Beth Doglio, D-Olympia. 
Republicans argued that providing benefits would be an incentive for union workers to strike. They tried unsuccessfully to amend the bill to exclude public school teachers and hospital workers.
“If you are paying people to strike, you will have more strikes,” said Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah.
The policy only assures a level of benefits is available “for workers when they do go on strike,” said Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek. “The state is not paying workers to strike.”
Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said the bill is unfair because taxpayers and businesses with no involvement in a labor disagreement will have their contributions to the unemployment insurance fund go to striking workers.
“People who are not a party to the disagreement will pay for it,” he said.
As written, a striking worker would become eligible for benefits on the second Sunday following the first day of a strike, provided that the strike is not found to be prohibited by federal or state law. Workers would be subject to a one-week waiting period after they become eligible for benefits. 
If a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law, any benefits paid are liable for repayment. 
Employees would also qualify for unemployment insurance during employer-initiated labor lockouts. Lockouts are one way management can pressure a striking workforce during contract negotiations.
Rep. Kristine Reeves, D-Federal Way, authored the amendment for the four-week limit on receiving benefits. It passed on a voice vote. Normally, unemployment insurance is available for up to 26 weeks in a one-year period.
If the bill becomes law, the changes would take effect Jan. 1, 2026, and last through Dec. 31, 2035.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2179899792-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-13 01:03:14.255994

Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, speaks in the chamber of the House of Delegates on the final day of the regular session on Saturday, April 12, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Lawmakers have approved nearly eliminating gender-affirming care for children in West Virginia, removing a narrow exemption in current state law that allows minors at risk for suicide to access hormone therapy and other medications.
Medical professionals warned lawmakers that it would increase the risk of self-harm and suicide in children who are currently receiving care.
The House of Delegates signed off on the measure Saturday on the final day of the legislative session. 
West Virginia already has a strict ban on gender-affirming care for minors, which prohibits gender reassignment surgeries. 
There is a narrow exemption under that current law allowing children diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria by two medical providers to access pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy under guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
Some supporters said Senate Bill 299 would close a loophole left open in 2023 when the near total ban passed. The measure is sponsored by Sen. Chris Rose, R-Monongalia. 
Del. Brandon Steele, R-Raleigh, supported the bill on the House floor, saying, “There’s no charity and good will in destroying the identity of a child and doing it for profit.”
Roughly 100 youth in the state are currently receiving gender-affirming care under that provision, according to testimony from medical professionals shared with lawmakers.
This measure would halt their medical care Aug. 1 if signed into law. 
Dr. Katie Waldeck, a pediatric critical care physician in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital, treats about two dozen children who are eligible within the state law’s exemption to receive gender-affirming care. She spoke before House Health Committee members last week, sharing emotional testimony that she worried about children’s well-being if their care was banned.
“I do not want to see them back in my unit with asphyxiation marks. I don’t want to see them overdosing. This is not about an agenda other than patient care. So that’s why I’m here,” said Dr. Katie Waldeck, a pediatric critical care physician in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital.
Republican tries to extend date for treatment cutoff
Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, attempted to amend the bill to allow children currently receiving pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy — as permitted in the state’s narrow exemption — to continue with their treatment until July 1, 2026, to help them taper off medication.
He said the bill’s effective date of this summer could be too soon for these children. 
“These medications do take some time to come down from … it would give us an opportunity for these children to either possibly move to another state or find another form of assistance for what they’re going through,” Flanigan said.
Del. Eric Brooks, R-Raleigh, urged a no vote, saying it was partially due to “political” motivations having promised voters he’d end gender-affirming medication. 
“For those of you that run on this issue or talk to your constituents and said, ‘I will support doing away with these drugs for these children,’ this is your time and this is your opportunity. It’s a good bill,” Brooks said. 
In response, Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, said, “This [amendment] is about empathy. This isn’t about you winning a race.”
Del. David Kelly, R-Tyler, said, “It’s not a political issue for me … We love to talk about love in here … But I think the greatest level of love we can show in here today is to care about kids who will be transitioning down, to give them the extra time that they may need.”
After a lengthy debate on the amendment, it was rejected with a vote of 28-71.
Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, then urged members to reject the bill itself, saying, “I would listen to the doctors on this and err on the side of caution when it comes to the prevention of suicide in children.”
Following Pushkin’s speech, Del. Charles Sheedy, R-Marshall, successfully called for members to move straight to voting on the bill, bypassing any other debate. In parliamentary procedure, it’s known as “point to question.”
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, said that Republicans had dominated debate time during an amendment, but, “when it was finally time for Democrats to voice our concerns, they cut it off.”
“It is a cruel bill, and especially without adopting Flanigan’s amendment, it’s going to harm people,” Hansen said. “This is a campaign bill, the mailer bill. In some situations, several of those delegates voted for the bill because they’re scared of the mailers and they’re afraid to stand up.”
Three Republicans joined all nine Democratic members of the House to oppose the measure in an 86-12 vote.
The Senate will have to concur with the House’s vote before the bill would go to Gov. Morrisey’s desk for consideration. 
Bill would require teachers to out students’ gender identity to parents
The House also passed Senate Bill 154, which would prohibit instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. It also mandates that teachers tell parents when a child requests to be referred to by a different name or pronouns that are different from the student’s biological sex.
Lawmakers struck out a provision of the bill that would have allowed parents to take legal action against schools that violated the bill. 
The session adjourns Saturday, April 12 at midnight.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)“Union busting bills” and a school voucher bill that threatened to siphon $100 million from public schools were on the table earlier this session, said Amanda Curtis, president of the Montana Federation of Public Employees.
And back in February, the state pay play wasn’t scheduled for a hearing in the Senate yet, she said.
But despite snowstorms and single digit temperatures, union members showed up to engage with lawmakers, Curtis said.
“Because we broke bread and had thoughtful, one-on-one conversations with legislators of both parties, we won,” Curtis told a few dozen rally-goers.
She said union members helped push off unfriendly bills and pulled the pay plan forward..

At a rally Friday at the Capitol with, at most, 18 days left in the session, Curtis praised the work union members had done, including 22 MFPE members who serve in the Montana Legislature.
The MFPE is the largest union in the state with more than 20,000 members.
Rep. Eric Matthews, D-Bozeman, said the legislature has passed the pay plan, and it’s a fair one. Matthews, a teacher, said the STARS Act, a comprehensive bill addressing starting teacher pay, still needs to pass, but it’s a positive proposal.
The Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act, House Bill 252, passed the House 88-9 and is making its way through the Senate.
“We still have to get the STARS Act out, which will definitely help the education system across Montana,” Matthews said.
Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, said Montana’s pensions are healthy, and they need to resist attacks. She said 73% of public employees report they would be more likely to leave their work if their pensions are cut.
Baum, a recently retired detective with the Billings Police Department, also urged Gov. Greg Gianforte to sign Senate Bill 7, which she said helps correct a wrong from last session.
The bill revises the retirement criteria for some law enforcement officers.
Instead of being eligible after 20 years of service and at the age of 50, it allows an officer to tap their retirement after reaching just one of the criteria.
The bill passed the legislature and is headed to Gianforte’s desk. A spokesperson for the Governor’s Office did not respond to an email for comment about the governor’s planned action.
Rep. Jill Cohenour, D-Helena, praised increases in the pay plan, including a minimum $10,400 for employees working for the state of Montana and the university system over the course of three years, “raises exceeding anything that has been there in the past two decades.”
“Hear me when I say that public employees in Montana deserve the pay plans that we have negotiated,” Cohenour said. “We deserve so much more.
“We are the people that Montanans go to when they need help starting a business, when they’re trying to find a job, when they’re trying to get back on their feet, when their roads need plowed, and when they’re experiencing a health crisis. We make families successful in communities across Montana.”
At the rally, Curtis also encouraged other union members to run for office in the future, even though “22 member legislators may be unheard of.”
“We need reinforcements in 2027, and it doesn’t matter what party you identify with,” Curtis said.
“If you believe that public service is a public good, if you believe that we must support public employees, if you believe that working people should have a voice and protections at work, we need you in this Capitol building.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3911-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-12 17:03:24.083064

Her bill won final approval in the Legislature on April 11, 2025 and is headed to the governor's desk. (Legislative Support Services)Washington is poised to require clergy members to report child abuse or neglect, even when it is disclosed in confession.
Nearly two-thirds of state House members approved a Senate bill on Friday night to make religious leaders mandatory reporters of abuse and neglect, adding them to a list that includes school counselors, police, and nurses. With passage of Senate Bill 5375 on a 64-31 vote, the legislation now goes to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson for signing.
“It’s long past time for this protection for children,” said state Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the bill’s sponsor, following the vote. “Members of the clergy play such an important role in the lives of children, like teachers and doctors do, and just like those other trusted adults, clergy should be mandatory reporters.”
More than half the states make clergy mandatory reporters, but most exempt what is heard in a confessional. If the Senate bill is signed, Washington would join the handful like New Hampshire and West Virginia where such conversations are not exempt.
Removing that privilege played a large part in the House floor debate on Friday.
“This bill is an attack on the Catholic and other faiths,” said Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah.
Some Republicans said they could support making clergy members mandatory reporters as long as the confessional privilege was maintained.
“I have anger at people that do this because it is so wrong. I want something that will work,” said Rep. Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake. “There is no way we can enforce this.”
Rep. Carolyn Eslick, R-Sultan, said she was abused as a five-year-old by a 16-year-old family friend. But, she said, similar laws in other states didn’t reduce child abuse and neglect.

“If I thought for one minute it would help our children, I would vote for it,” she said.
Supporters said the bill will help protect children by ensuring that if they confide to a religious leader that they are being mistreated, they can trust that person will do something to help.
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, said as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, “what makes a difference is when it stops. It stops when it becomes known.”
State law requires teachers, police, registered nurses, social service counselors and members of several other professions to report to law enforcement or the state Department of Children, Youth and Families if they have reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.
The bill adds clergy to the list, but it retains their privilege to not be compelled to testify in a court case or criminal proceeding.
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
The Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the legislation. They said it would force priests to break the seal of confession, considered a sacred promise to never reveal any of the information disclosed.
Republicans argued the abusers would do more harm because they would no longer be able to freely confide and seek forgiveness.
“It will drive these conversations underground. No children will be protected,” Rep. Hunter Abell, R-Inchelium.
 This marked the third consecutive year Frame attempted to make this change in law.
“It’s finally on its way to the governor’s desk,” Frame said. She thanked the survivors of abuse who shared their experiences throughout the years of legislative process.
“I hope their pain is lessened by the knowledge that there are future children who won’t have to suffer like they did, thanks to their advocacy,” she said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/noel-frame-.jpeg,,,2025-04-12 17:03:24.083064

On a late afternoon in November 2017, Witney Arch told her 1-1/2-year-old son to stop playing and come inside. Upset, he grabbed her right breast when she picked him up. She experienced a shock of pain but did not think it was anything serious. A week later, however, the ache had not subsided. After trips to several doctors, a biopsy revealed that Arch had early-stage breast cancer. Her surgeon told her that it was likely invasive and aggressive.
By the end of January, she had made two critical decisions. She would get a double mastectomy. And she wanted her operation at the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans, a medical facility renowned for its highly specialized approach to breast cancer care and reconstruction. The two surgeons who founded it had pioneered techniques that used a woman’s own body tissue to form new breasts post mastectomy.
The idea of a natural restoration appealed to Arch.
“I don’t judge anybody for getting implants, especially if you’ve had cancer,” she said. “But I felt like I was taking something foreign out of my body, cancer, and I did not want to put something foreign back in.”
Arch was a 42-year-old preschool teacher for her church, with four young children, living in a suburb of New Orleans. The 1-1/2-year-old had been born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. Caring for him consumed her life. By nature upbeat and optimistic, Arch felt blessed that her son’s act of defiance had led to an early diagnosis.
“We’re going to pray about this and we’re going to figure it out,” she told her husband.

Arch asked her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, for approval to go to the center for her care, and the company granted it, a process known as prior authorization. Then, a week or so before her surgery, Arch was wrangling child care and meal plans when she got a call from the insurer. The representative on the line was trying to persuade her to have the surgery elsewhere. She urged Arch to seek a hospital that, unlike the center, was in network and charged less.
“Do you realize how much this is going to cost?” Arch remembered the agent asking. Arch did not need more stress, but here it was — from her own health plan.
“I feel very comfortable with my decision,” she replied. “My doctor teaches other doctors around the world how to do this.”
Over the next year, Arch underwent five operations to rid herself of cancer and reconstruct her breasts.
Arch did not know it at the time, but her surgery would become evidence in a long-running legal fight between the breast center’s founders, surgeons Frank DellaCroce and Scott Sullivan, and Blue Cross, Louisiana’s biggest health insurance company, with an estimated two-thirds share of the market. DellaCroce and Sullivan had repeatedly sued the insurer, alleging that it granted approvals for surgery but then denied payments or paid only a fraction of patients’ bills.
They pointed to calls like the one Arch received as proof of the company’s effort to drive away patients. The aggressive legal attack, they knew, was fraught. Litigation against the $3.4 billion company would take a long time and a lot of money. The chances of winning were slight.
“You fight dragons at great peril,” DellaCroce would tell friends.
But this September, after 18 years and several defeats in court, jurors found Blue Cross liable for fraud. They awarded the center $421 million — one of the largest verdicts ever to a single medical practice outside of a class-action lawsuit. In a statement, Blue Cross said it “disagrees with the jury’s decision, which we believe was wrong on the facts and the law. We have filed an appeal and expect to be successful.”
Frustration with insurers is at an all-time high. The December fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione serves as an extreme and tragic example. Doctors and insurers are locked into a perpetual conflict over health care costs, with patients caught in the middle. Doctors accuse insurance plans of blocking payments for health care treatments that can save the patients’ lives. Insurance companies insist they shouldn’t pay for procedures that they say are unnecessary or overpriced. It is easy to emerge from an examination of the American health care system with a cynicism that both sides are broken and corrupt.
Jeff Landry picks formerly indicted Jindal official to run Louisiana health department again

However, interviews with scores of doctors, patients and insurance executives, as well as reviews of internal documents, regulatory filings and academic studies, reveal a fundamental truth: The two sides are not evenly matched. Insurance companies are players in the fight over money, and they are also the referees. Insurers produce their own guidelines to determine whether to pay claims. When a doctor appeals a denial, insurers make all the initial decisions.
In legal settings, insurers are often given favorable standing in their ability to set what conditions they are required to cover. Federal and state insurance regulators lack the resources to pursue individual complaints against multibillion-dollar companies. Six major insurers, which include some of the nation’s largest companies, cover half of all Americans. They are pitted against tens of thousands of doctors’ practices and large hospital chains.
The Blue Cross trial provides a rare opportunity to expose in detail the ways that health insurance companies wield power over doctors and their patients. Blue Cross executives testified that the breast center charged too much money — sometimes more than $180,000 for an operation. The center, they said, deserved special attention because it had a history of questionable charges.
But the insurer’s defense went even further, to the very meaning of “prior authorization,” which it had granted women like Arch to pursue surgery. The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “not a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, in a deposition. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.
From 2015 through 2023, the Baton Rouge-based insurer paid, on average, less than 9% of the charges billed by the breast center for more than 7,800 individual medical procedures — even though it had authorized all of them. Thousands of such claims were never paid at all, according to court records.
Testimony revealed that the health plan never considered thousands of appeals filed by the center. Corporate documents showed Blue Cross executives had set up secret processes for approving operations and reimbursing the clinic and its doctors that resulted in reduced fees and payment delays.
One lucrative strategy: A national-level policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to take a cut of any savings it achieved in paying the breast center on behalf of patients covered by out-of-state Blue Cross companies, meaning the less the insurer paid out, the more it earned.
In Sullivan’s words, the insurer was hypocritical, “morally bankrupt.” Blue Cross had stranded many of the center’s patients with high bills, amounts that it had absorbed over the years. On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment. To Sullivan, it seemed the insurer was willing to pay the center when patients had connections but would fight when patients did not.
Blue Cross declined to comment on any individual cases but said in a statement that single case agreements were “common in the industry” and were available to all members when needed to access out-of-network providers.
The center
Nobody would take the breast center and its adjoining hospital as an ordinary medical establishment. The two facilities take up a city block along St. Charles Avenue, the thoroughfare famous for its streetcars, Mardi Gras parades and Queen Anne mansions. Patients access the complex — created by merging a former law office, funeral home, car dealership and Dunkin’ Donuts — by driving around back where a porte cochere leads into a soaring atrium.
Light pours in through windows set in the high ceiling. Arrangements of white orchids are scattered among comfortable couches and chairs. Here, women consult with doctors to plan their treatment. Surgeries are performed at the 39-bed hospital, which has an Icee machine in a family room. New-age music plays softly throughout the building. Rooms are designed to be as homey as possible, with medical gear hidden away and seascapes by a local artist hanging on the wall. One patient’s husband referred to it as a “spa-spital.”
The idea of combining the luxury feel of an upscale plastic surgery practice with the mission-driven zeal of a medical clinic came to DellaCroce and Sullivan while they were young surgeons. The two grew up in Louisiana. Sullivan spent much of his childhood in Mandeville, a suburb of New Orleans on the north side of Lake Ponchartrain, his dad employed in the oil and gas industry. His mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor.
“I definitely was not going to become a priest,” he said.
DellaCroce’s father worked at the paper mill in West Monroe in the state’s northern neck. His mother, a nurse, gave him an appreciation for medicine as a career that was “meaningful and challenging.”

They became friends while working at the Louisiana State University medical center, where they earned the nickname “the Sushi Brothers” for their favorite lunch. They were drawn to microsurgery and breast reconstruction because it was an emerging field that was innovating and improving care. Both men became board-certified in plastic surgery.
Sullivan, 60, is the hard-charging businessman, stocky, direct and blunt. DellaCroce, 58, with a ponytail, goatee and soft drawl, is more the diplomat, patient and cerebral. The pair have lectured around the world and written numerous medical journal articles.
They opened their first office in 2003 in a single room rented from a fellow doctor at what was then known as Memorial Medical Center, the hulking private hospital in New Orleans. They performed operations at facilities throughout the region but found that most gave little consideration to their patients’ comfort. They wanted to build a different kind of hospital.
“Can we give them that little bit of extra without breaking the budget to make the experience less awful? Can’t make it great, but can you make it less awful?” DellaCroce explained. “Can you attend to the human side of this patient and give them the added value of peace and confidence?”
Hurricane Katrina set back their construction plans, and the new edifice, named the St. Charles Surgical Hospital, did not open its doors until 2009. It boasts of being the only hospital in the country devoted solely to care for breast cancer patients who have received mastectomies. The center does not provide radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The majority of patients come from out of state.
Women seeking to have their breasts restored after a mastectomy face two paths. Some choose a relatively straightforward surgical procedure using implants filled with silicon or another gel. The center specializes in the other option, what’s known as autologous tissue reconstruction, where a woman’s own fat is taken from one part of the body, like the bottom or the stomach, and used to rebuild the breast. The procedure requires a longer recovery time, but the new breasts become part of the body.
The transplant surgery is lengthy and complex. Operations can last up to 12 hours with big medical teams involved. One surgeon performs the mastectomy while another creates a new breast by knitting together layers of fat and tissue.
Concentration is intense. The surgeons stare through glasses with microscopes to connect new blood vessels with a needle that’s thinner than an eyelash, using thread less than half the width of a human hair. DellaCroce and Sullivan invented techniques, for example, allowing tissue to be taken from multiple sites when a woman did not have enough fat in one part of her body for a full restoration.
One afternoon last fall, DellaCroce strode into a cavernous operating room to check on a patient. On the table in front of him, a woman lay covered in curtains of blue surgical cloth, only her torso exposed. Earlier in the day, a surgical oncologist had removed her right breast as part of a mastectomy to treat her cancer. Later, another surgeon had taken flaps of fat from her stomach and interlaced them with blood vessels to create a new breast to replace the lost one.

Now, in the fifth hour of surgery, a physician’s assistant leaned over her midsection, closing an incision along her side with some final stitches. Nurses hurried around the space, preparing to wrap up the operation. Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al” played in the background. The smell of burnt flesh hung in the air. A blue light signaled that the new arteries were successfully pumping blood. “Wow, that woman looks really good,” DellaCroce told the physician’s assistant. “Nice job.”
There is no denying that the center’s high-end treatment means high costs. The median charge for an operation and hospital stay is about $165,000. DellaCroce and Sullivan hired consultants to review other well-regarded practices, who advised them their prices were competitive with their peers. “We weren’t asking to be paid Lebron James, best of the best, even though we feel we’re in the top 1 or 2% of the country,” Sullivan said. “We just wanted something fair.”
Blue Cross and Blue Shield
It is one of the quirks of the American health care system that insurers almost never pay the prices for procedures demanded by doctors and hospitals.
To understand why requires a tour of the grand bargain at the heart of the health insurance system. Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals and doctors to discount reimbursements on medical procedures, like office visits or MRI scans. Providers who sign these contracts are in network. Insurance companies like in-network doctors because they can budget for health expenses and set premiums accordingly. Doctors and hospitals agree to be in network because they get a steady stream of insured patients.
DellaCroce and Sullivan held contracts with insurers that resulted in average payments to the center’s doctors in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. But DellaCroce and Sullivan never came to an agreement with Blue Cross. That made them an exception in Louisiana — the insurer is so dominant that 97% of local physicians and hospitals are in network.
DellaCroce and Sullivan said the company was not offering them enough money — in some cases not even enough to cover the cost of the surgeries, they argued in court documents. The doctors and their hospital remained out of network, meaning they charged Blue Cross the full price for their procedures.
Such charges are controversial. Insurance companies and many health experts say they are too often inflated and untethered from actual costs. Physicians and hospitals say their fees are justified, reflecting the true price of medical care. In the end, insurers — especially in states like Louisiana, with few competitors — use their market power in negotiations to set reimbursements at what they want to pay, not what doctors charge.

At Blue Cross, Dwight Brower was charged with reviewing the bills from the breast center. He had worked as a physician at a small family practice in Baton Rouge and then at a local hospital before joining Blue Cross as a medical director. He helped oversee prior authorizations. While many patients assume that an approval means an insurer will pay for an operation, it is simply a recognition that a procedure is medically necessary. Federal law mandates that private insurers cover breast restorations for women who undergo mastectomies because of cancer or genetic risk. And patients, in general, are allowed to choose their own doctors.
However, since the center was out of network and had no contract with the insurer, Blue Cross determined how much it would pay for the treatment, and Brower believed that the breast center’s bills were exorbitant.
“I did not think that they were reasonable,” he would later testify.
Surgeons doing lung transplants or brain surgery rarely billed Blue Cross more than $50,000 for their work. Why should DellaCroce and Sullivan get so much more?
“Don’t get me wrong. The surgeons at the center are extremely skilled,” he acknowledged. The operations were often lengthy. “But so are open-heart surgeries,” he said. “Relative to some of the other extremely complicated surgeries done by other surgeons in other areas of the body, it just seemed like their fee schedule was extremely high.”
Blue Cross Louisiana executives testified that they did not even consider doctors’ invoices when making decisions on what to reimburse because such charges were “unregulated” and “nonstandard.” Instead, they paid “an amount we establish” — unless the doctor’s bill was cheaper. In the end, the insurer said it settled on reimbursing the breast center about the same as in-network doctors performing similar operations, even though DellaCroce and Sullivan did not benefit from having patients referred to them.
In practice, that meant the insurer paid out a fraction of the breast center’s bills. Of the 7,837 medical procedures in dispute in the lawsuit, involving 1,680 patients, Blue Cross paid about $43 million on invoices totaling $500 million. Some 60% of the claims weren’t reimbursed at all. The difference between the bill and the payment could be striking. For example, in the case of Arch, Blue Cross paid $8,580 out of $102,722 for one operation. For another, it paid $3,190 out of $34,975.
Executives said the Blue Cross reimbursements were fair, designed to keep premiums low for the nearly 2 million Louisianans who depended on the insurer to cover their health care. Paying the breast center’s full fees would add to its customers’ burden, they said.

“If we were to just agree to any rates or any prices set by physicians or any providers, it would cause cost to be exorbitantly high for both the plan and for members particularly, because we wouldn’t be able to forecast or make sure those plans are actually sound,” said Curtis Anders, the vice president of provider networks for Blue Cross. “Premiums would increase.”
For many out-of-network doctors, payments lower than their invoices are an infuriating part of doing business. They absorb the costs, or pass them on to their patients, a practice known as balance billing that can result in medical debt. DellaCroce and Sullivan were the rare physicians with the tenacity to fight. The center collected money from both insurers and patients — but it carried the unpaid portion of invoices on its books. That amount grew every year as it battled Blue Cross.
DellaCroce and Sullivan were convinced that Blue Cross had singled them out for their obstreperousness, but they had no proof. Then, during a phone call one day, an employee for the center was talking to a Blue Cross representative to obtain a prior authorization. The representative let slip that the request required special handling. The breast center’s doctors were flagged on an internal roster. It was called the targeted list.
Discoveries
On Dec. 8, 2023, several dozen attorneys and paralegals from Chehardy Sherman Williams, one of New Orleans’ top law firms, were celebrating their annual holiday party. They had gathered in a private dining room with gilded mirrors and shimmering chandeliers at Arnaud’s restaurant, a bastion of Creole cuisine in the heart of the French Quarter. The waiters served shrimp remoulade, prime rib and turtle soup. Small talk filled the air.
Suddenly, several attorneys’ cellphones buzzed as they all received the same email, a message from the lawyers for Blue Cross. It contained discovery for the case, more than 42,000 pages of internal documents, emails and policies.
Matthew Sherman, one of the attorneys representing the center, turned to a colleague. “Can you believe this?” he asked. It was like something from a John Grisham novel, the kind of thing he and his friends had joked about at law school, a document dump at Christmas time.
By long tradition, many of New Orleans’ biggest law firms hold their holiday parties on the same Friday afternoon in December. Afterward, rival attorneys from around town gather for drinks under a flag of truce at a local bar. Sherman realized there would be no afterparty this year. Nor much of a holiday vacation.
Louisiana spent $2.4B to improve Medicaid. A lot of the money went to administrative functions.

The delivery of the documents was a Christmas gift nearly 20 years in the making. DellaCroce and Sullivan’s first lawsuits against Blue Cross, involving 88 breach-of-contract claims filed in a Louisiana civil court beginning in 2006, were dismissed because of a federal court ruling regarding jurisdiction. A second lawsuit, which lasted from 2010 through 2017, resulted in limited discovery and a two-day trial in federal court. Jurors found that Blue Cross had failed to tell the center how much it would pay for procedures, but they also ruled the center had not been financially harmed. A judge dismissed the remaining claims.
DellaCroce and Sullivan launched their third lawsuit in February 2017 with a novel legal theory: They accused Blue Cross of fraud. They contended that for years the insurer had issued prior authorizations without the intention of paying the actual bills. Their lawyers had sought the targeted list during discovery to help prove the case. Blue Cross denied it existed.
But now, as Sherman and fellow attorney Patrick Follette began poring over the thousands of documents, they came upon a spreadsheet that said “Targeted Provider List.” The first names on the list were DellaCroce and Sullivan. It was labeled “confidential” and dated June 2007 — about a year after the pair had filed their first lawsuit against Blue Cross alleging nonpayment. More digging turned up other documents. There was a “blocked” list that also featured the two doctors.
A corporate policy document provided what DellaCroce and Sullivan considered the most revealing explanation for Blue Cross’ financial motivation. Blue Cross insurers are independent companies that operate under a common set of rules, similar to franchisees in a fast-food chain. When a person covered by Blue Cross in their home state receives treatment in another state, the Blue Cross where the treatment occurs pays the provider and then recoups the cost from the home-state plan.
What the attorneys discovered was that Blue Cross Louisiana would receive a share of any savings it could generate for the home-state plan. Say, for instance, Blue Cross Alabama was facing a bill of $5,000 for a procedure. If Blue Cross Louisiana instead paid $1,000, it saved the Alabama plan $4,000. The policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to earn 16% of the savings — in this scenario, $640.
For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the revelations cemented their belief that Blue Cross was a bad corporate actor more interested in power and control than health care. The percentage fee incentivized the insurer to pay the doctors as little as possible. The bigger the savings, the more Blue Cross made.
“It’s win-win,” DellaCroce said. “That’s their pay day.”
As the trial approached, Blue Cross attempted to settle the case. DellaCroce and Sullivan refused the offer as too low.
The trial
On the afternoon of Sept. 5, 2024, the case — St. Charles Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. and Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, L.L.C. v. Louisiana Health Service & Indemnity Company D/B/A Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Louisiana, Inc. and HMO Louisiana, Inc. — opened in Division C of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, a high-ceilinged room with dark brown benches and tables, fake marble columns and fluorescent lights.
James Williams, the chief litigator for the hospital, had already impressed the 45 potential jurors by memorizing all their names and backgrounds during jury selection. Now, he stood up and placed a football on the plaintiff’s table in front of the 12 chosen to try the case, which included a third-grade teacher, a movie stunt double and a hotel manager. He warned them that they would hear a lot of “insurance talk” from Blue Cross.
“I’m going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen on the jury, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on what this case is about,” Williams told them. “If they start saying things like, ‘Well, oh, we paid them what we thought was fair, 9%,’ keep your eye on the ball, right?”
Over 10 days — interrupted by a two-day break to allow a hurricane to pass across Louisiana — Williams made his case that Blue Cross had defrauded his clients by making promises to pay but failing to deliver.

Much of Blue Cross’ defense had relied on the notice that a prior authorization was no guarantee of payment. The insurer had not committed fraud, it said, since it never explicitly promised the center to reimburse anything. Udvarhelyi, the former CEO, had insisted on that. But on the stand, Blue Cross witnesses provided a more nuanced explanation.
They acknowledged that the disclaimer was not meant as a general excuse to free the company from paying bills. A prior authorization “usually” resulted in a payment, testified Brower, who reviewed the center’s bills. He said that the notice was intended for specific situations.
For instance, Blue Cross would not cover a woman who dropped out of her insurance before the operation. Nor would it pay anything if a patient had not met her deductible. But otherwise, Brower said, Blue Cross intended to compensate for a procedure that it had authorized.
“It’s inappropriate for us as a company to approve a code and then turn around and deny it,” Brower said.
Over the years, the center had appealed thousands of reimbursements for being too low. It hired additional employees to manage the paperwork. At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” acknowledged Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.
This was the core of the case. The insurer set the rules. The insurer set the prices. Doctors could appeal to a state insurance regulator. But if that failed, and it often did, the only recourse was a long, costly lawsuit.
Williams summed up for the jury the center’s treatment at the hands of Blue Cross: “Our payments are slow pay, low pay or no pay.”
In countering those arguments, Blue Cross witnesses explained that the insurer was committed to paying for Louisianans’ health care and keeping costs low. As a nonprofit, it directed any excess revenue from operations back into the business. (Udvarhelyi, the CEO, did acknowledge that his salary, over $1 million, included bonuses that depended on hitting revenue targets and increasing membership.)
Brian West, a Blue Cross executive who monitored payments, said the center had engaged in “egregious” billing practices.
“They are bad actors in the billing world,” he said.
But company witnesses offered only a handful of examples. Sometimes the center mistakenly coded its bills in a way that appeared to charge for four separate breast reconstructions in a single operation. In other cases, the center asked for payment for two surgeons in the room at the same time. But Blue Cross, following Medicare guidelines, would pay two surgeons only 20% more than the reimbursement for a single surgeon.
Blue Cross did not accuse the center of any intentional miscoding — but the sloppy billing led to additional scrutiny, the company’s witnesses said. The targeted list, a witness testified, had been created especially for the center, requiring all prior authorization requests to bypass normal routes for a special review by company doctors.
The blocked list meant that each bill from the center received a manual scrub by payment specialists before reimbursement. Blue Cross acknowledged the careful checking often resulted in the need for more information from the center, which could result in slower processing of claims. But the lists, executives insisted, were not designed to reduce payments.
“Basically, no harm was done,” said Becky Juncker, who was involved in approving surgical procedures.
Company witnesses explained that the 16% received in saving money for out-of-state Blue Cross insurers was a fee to cover the costs of handling adjustments of the claim — though they were not able to explain why Blue Cross did not charge a flat fee for its services.
Blue Cross also defended itself against the accusation that it had paid nothing for 60% of the charges for individual procedures. Witnesses said the insurer had followed industry practice in bundling charges to make a single payment for an operation. An attorney for the center noted that it had never agreed to take bundled payments — Blue Cross had imposed them.
As to the calls to women like Arch? That was an effort to save members money.
“Our medical area would reach out to our members who were utilizing out-of-network providers to help them understand the, I would say, the financial implications,” said Shepherd, the Blue Cross executive vice president, in a deposition. “It could be financially catastrophic to a member to have an out-of-network claim that they are financially responsible for. It’s a huge difference.”
In summing up the case, Kim Boyle, the lead attorney for the company, told jurors that Blue Cross had not committed fraud. It had acted to ensure the company and its members paid a fair price for the center’s services, she said.
“There’s no scheme. There’s no plot. There’s no mafia. There are no Blue Cross employees of Louisiana that are sitting in some smoke-filled room in Baton Rouge, plotting against these plaintiffs on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans,” Boyle said. “It’s fiction; it’s fancy; it’s completely made up.”

On Sept. 20, at 1:57 p.m., Judge Sidney H. Cates IV sent the jurors to deliberate. The center attorneys retreated to a nearby hotel to await the verdict. About two hours later, they were summoned back to Division C. Williams put his head down and swore. He worried that such a quick return in the legally complex case meant victory for Blue Cross.
The center’s lawyers paid close attention to Cates as he reviewed the jurors’ decision. It was a two-page form. If the jurors found in favor of Blue Cross, the judge would have no reason to read on.
Cates flipped to the second page: The jurors had found Blue Cross liable for fraud.
“Please express in dollars the total monetary compensation, if any, Blue Cross owes the hospital and the center for the damages,” Cates said, reading from the verdict. “Net damages, $421,488,633.”
The center’s lawyers stood and shook hands as the insurer’s attorneys prepared to leave the courtroom.
DellaCroce was in surgery at the hospital, having expected a longer deliberation. Sullivan was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Afterward, jurors approached and thanked him for his work. He teared up.
“We would have given more if we had been asked for more. That’s how egregious the fraud was,” Juliet Laughlin, a 58-year-old property manager who served as forewoman, later said. “There had been wrong done.”
Blue Cross has appealed the verdict.
A health insurance trade group has warned that the finding sets a dangerous precedent. If allowed to stand, insurance companies in Louisiana may find themselves forced to pay whatever price is demanded by out-of-network doctors — which in turn could raise health insurance premiums across the state, the Louisiana Association of Health Plans said in a statement.
For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the verdict was vindication. They had refused to sign contracts they thought unfair. They had rejected settlement offers they thought too low. The trial had revealed Blue Cross’ domineering behavior.
“Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control,” DellaCroce said. “That was regarded as a threat.”
In the months since the judgment, Blue Cross has not changed its practices, the doctors said. It has not approached with an offer that would bring the hospital in network. It still issues prior authorizations for women’s surgeries. And it still pays only a fraction of the billed fees.
