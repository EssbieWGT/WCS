(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)STURGIS — In a speech formally launching his campaign for Congress on Tuesday, South Dakota Republican Marty Jackley signaled a desire to bring workers into the country legally while preventing unauthorized immigration.
“We need to have a national immigration policy that considers public safety and the workforce,” Jackley said. “We need to have E-Verify and visas working. I promise you I’ll be committed to doing that as your congressman.”
E-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the United States. The system has been beset with well-chronicled problems, including a Cato Institute study alleging thousands of people lost out on jobs because E-Verify incorrectly flagged them.

Jackley made his campaign announcement at the Loud American restaurant and bar in Sturgis, on the edge of the Black Hills, where many employers in the area depend on workers with visas to fill seasonal tourism jobs. A visa is a document granting foreigners permission to visit, work or study in the country.
Jackley serves as South Dakota’s attorney general. He’ll continue in that role through next year while running for Congress. There’s an open race for the state’s lone U.S. House seat next year, because Republican South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.
In Jackley’s speech to a room packed with dozens of supporters, he touched on his crime-fighting credentials and his experience serving on a council that advised President Donald Trump on law enforcement issues.
On economic development, Jackley pledged to work toward a “fair playing field” and boasted of winning a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair, which paved the way for states to force certain online retailers to pay state sales taxes. Jackley said the ability to avoid sales taxes gave online retailers an unfair advantage over local stores.
He also recapped his record on government accountability, including his prosecution of six cases since last year against former state employees for allegations related to their work for state government.
In one of the highest-profile cases, Jackley won a guilty verdict at trial in April against a former Department of Social Services worker who stole $1.8 million from the state over a 13-year period. In response to the rash of state employee crimes, Jackley also supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
“I brought legislation so that we can better protect the taxpayer dollars and what’s been going on in Pierre, and I’ll do the same thing if you send me to Washington,” he said.

If Jackley wins, he would be the first person with roots in South Dakota’s less populated West River region — the area west of the Missouri River — to represent the state in the U.S. House since Republican John Thune held the seat from 1997 to 2003. Thune, whose hometown is Murdo, is now the U.S. Senate majority leader.
Jackley, 54, grew up in Sturgis and still has a ranch in the area, along with another ranch near Pierre. After earning an electrical engineering degree from South Dakota Mines, he added a law degree from the University of South Dakota. He served as the U.S. attorney for South Dakota from 2006 to 2009, and then as attorney general for the state from 2009 to 2019.
Term limits prevented him from seeking another consecutive term as attorney general in the 2018 elections. He sought the Republican nomination for governor that year and lost by 12 points in the primary election to Kristi Noem, who went on to serve as governor until leaving earlier this year to lead the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for Trump. Jackley ran for attorney general again in 2022 and was unopposed in the general election.
Besides Jackley, at least one other Republican — state Sen. Casey Crabtree of Madison — has formed a fundraising committee to potentially seek the U.S. House seat. That sets up a possible race in the primary election on June 2, 2026, to determine the Republican nominee before the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.
Democrats may have their own U.S. House primary race with at least three federal statements of candidacy filed so far by Scott Schlagel of Dell Rapids, and Billy Mawhiney and Nikki Gronli, both of Sioux Falls.
Jackley’s candidacy for U.S. House creates an open race for attorney general next year. At least one person — Lance Russell, the Republican state’s attorney of Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties — has announced his intention to seek the job.

Right-wing legislators, advocacy groups, and dark-money donors are trying to dictate what can be taught, which books can be read, and which speakers are welcome on our campuses.
While some lawmakers at the state and national levels have moved to restrict the instruction of topics like race, gender, and history, the Pam Bondi-led Department of Justice-issued guidance on July 29 is designed to handcuff universities and K-12 schools, threatening “significant legal risks” should universities and school districts continue with time-tested, data-proven initiatives to support students.
Is every right-of-center legislator, especially those in locally elected positions, part of the systematic coup against education and our democratic experiment? Of course not, but private dissent is a fool’s errand. Where are their voices? The outspoken redirect to local issues but unlike any other time, national is local.

Christopher M. Piscitelli
The attack on DEI programs, targeting of our LGBTQ+ students, the attempt to push a false version of history into our classrooms is part of a larger platform to reimagine America as a right-wing wet dream. They’re weaponizing fear and exploiting apathy with a goal of tearing down our hallmark institutions by turning them into ideological battlegrounds.
Our greatest fictitious president, Andrew Shepherd, [from the 1995 film, The American President] said it best: “[they] are only interested two things, making you afraid of it and telling you who’s to blame for it.”
Democracy is being tested, not in our history books, but right now. It is not whether we say the right things, but whether we do the right things. In his 1961 Inaugural Address, John F. Kennedy said, “every one of us is in a position of responsibility; and, in the final analysis, the kind of government we get depends upon how we fulfill those responsibilities. We, the people, are the boss, and we will get the kind of political leadership, be it good or bad, that we demand and deserve.”
Before the public trust in universities erodes, we must recommit to free inquiry and resist censorship pressures. Our democratic experiment cannot function without a citizenry trained to think critically and engage in healthy debate and dialogue. We must not allow our classrooms to be turned into civic battlegrounds of censorship and fear.
Today, we must resoundingly say, no more. Voting is the bare minimum. Organizing, volunteering, donating, speaking up — that’s how we make real change.

In Hamden, challenger Adam Sendroff won the Democratic mayoral nomination with 47% of the vote in a five-way race. Dominique Baez, the party-endorsed candidate, was a distant second with 22%.  
Sendroff, the former school board chair, is all but assured of victory in November in heavily Democratic Hamden. He would succeed Mayor Lauren Garrett, a Democrat who did not seek reelection. Baez’ campaign was hit by news of her business being evicted.
In Norwalk, the largest city with a mayoral primary, council president Barbara Smyth defeated fellow council member Darlene Young, becoming the instant favorite to succeed the long-serving Democrat, Mayor Harry Rilling, who did not seek reelection.
In Bridgeport, there is no mayoral race this year, but absentee ballots once again played a decisive role in a Democratic primary: According to Only in Bridgeport, the political web site, Councilwoman Maria Pereira won her primary while losing at the polls and winning on the absentees. 
Pereira is currently facing criminal charges arising from the alleged abuse of absentee ballots in the 2023 municipal election.
Overall, voters went to the polls in 21 communities for 11 Democratic and 10 Republican primaries. Nominations for either mayor or first selectman were on the ballot in five GOP and four Democratic contests.
The Democratic primaries were in Bloomfield, Bridgeport, Chester, Hamden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, North Haven, Norwalk, Stamford and Stratford.
In addition to the mayoral races in Hamden, Norwalk and Stratford, there was a Democratic primary for first selectman in Chester; the incumbent, Cynthia Lignar, easily defeated her challenger, Joe Cohen. 
David Chess, the endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate in Stratford, won with nearly 90% of the vote over Linda Manos for the right to face the Republican mayor, Laura Hoydick, in November.
The GOP races were in Greenwich, Griswold, Haddam, Oxford, Plainfield, Sterling, Thomaston, Voluntown, Waterbury and Wolcott, with the nominations for the chief-elected positions at stake in Oxford, Plainfield, Sterling, Voluntown and Wolcott.
First Selectman George R. Temple of Oxford, who led the community through a devastating flood last year in his seventh term, was stunned to be denied the GOP endorsement in July. Rather than retire at 79, he forced a primary and defeated his former protege, Jeffrey Luff.
Unofficial results showed him winning with 57% of the vote.
Perhaps the quirkiest race of the night was in Plainfield, a small town near the Rhode Island border. 
Like Temple, the Republican incumbent, Kevin M. Cunningham, was snubbed in a GOP caucus. But there was a twist: the endorsement went to a Democratic predecessor, Paul E. Sweet, who switched parties.
Cunningham won Tuesday night with 51% of the vote.
In Voluntown, the endorsed Republican, Brian Muschiano, defeated challenger  Christopher A. Wilson for first selectman with 61% of the vote. The Republican incumbent, Tracey Hanson, is not running after winning four terms, the last three without opposition.
In nearby Sterling, the endorsed Republican, Myron “Jack” Joslyn, won with 52% in a three-way with Frank Bood Sr. and Kimberly Ann Gunn. Joslyn, a selectman, would step up to succeed First Selectman Lincoln Cooper, who is not running.
In Wolcott, where the unaffiliated mayor, Thomas G. Dunn, has been unopposed in four consecutive races, the GOP challenger, Paul D. D’Angelo defeated James Paolino, 52% to 48%.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-11.07.45-PM-1024x575.png,,,2025-09-09 23:56:31.985240

Wes Moore (D) officially announced his reelection campaign Tuesday, saying that any challengers should ""be prepared to defend their record,"" including when it comes to President Donald Trump (R). (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)It isn’t clear who he’ll be up against come November 2026, but Gov. Wes Moore (D), who formally announced his reelection bid on Tuesday, already has a message for the eventual challenger.
“Whoever it is, they should come ready, because we have a very real record to run on — and a record that we’re very proud of,” said Moore, adding that he intends to make any GOP challenger’s ties to President Donald Trump (R) a campaign issue in deep-blue Maryland.
“Whether it’s Republican Ed Hale or Republican Steve Hershey or Republican Larry Hogan or Republican Andy Harris or Republican John Myrick — there’s a lot of people who are making a similar type of noise,” Moore said.
Only one of the people he named, Myrick, has officially entered the race. Hershey, the Senate minority leader who represents the Upper Shore, announced last week that he had formed a gubernatorial exploratory committee — partly in response to Hale, a businessman and lifelong Democrat who recently switched parties after acknowledging he was unlikely to beat Moore in a Democratic primary.
Hogan, the state’s first two-term Republican governor in decades, who served from 2014 to 2022, has been coy about his 2026 plans. Harris, the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, has not indicated that he plans to run for governor.
During Tuesday’s news conference outside the State House, Moore touted the economic side of his record, pointing to job growth since he took office, and arguing that his administration has slowed “out-of-control spending” in Maryland. It comes after a uniquely tough budget year, during which the General Assembly had to cut spending and raise fees to overcome a $3.3 billion deficit projected for fiscal 2026.
But Moore also pointed to historic reductions in violent crime, even as he continues to feud with Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore to crack down on criminal activity. With the city experiencing a dramatic decline in homicides, Moore and others say federal troops are not needed, although the governor did announce a heightened deployment of state police in the city Friday.
Hershey forms exploratory committee, will weigh run for governor

Whichever Republican Moore faces in the 2026 general election in 2026, it’s clear that Trump will loom large. Moore said Tuesday that Republican candidates should also come prepared to “explain why they have been so dead silent, when we’re watching the ravages of Donald Trump coming to the state.”
On Tuesday, Moore was quick to attack the president on everything from tax policy to federal job cuts — including in a video announcement that officially kicked off his candidacy. There, he argued that Trump is “bending over backwards for billionaires and big corporations.”
The video garnered a social media response from at least one Moore opponent in Myrick, who finished a distant fifth to Hogan in a seven-candidate Republican primary field for U.S. Senate in 2024.
“What a crock,” Myrick wrote of Moore’s announcement. “Maryland deserves better.”
Myrick, a Prince George’s County resident who chose former state Del. Brenda Thiam as his running mate, has targeted Moore on economic and tax issues in particular, and argued that steep cuts to Maryland’s federal workforce are a result of Moore’s refusal to “work with” the Trump administration.
In addition to Myrick, the only other Republican to officially file for governor is Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll County firearms instructor. Moore does have one Democratic challenger, Ralph Jaffe, who has run unsuccessfully for governor or U.S. senators in eight previous elections going back to 1992.
Moore’s campaign kickoff also drew a response Tuesday from the conservative Maryland Freedom Caucus, which pointed to the fact that Moore signed a budget with $1.6 billion in taxes and fees. It also said some of the spending cuts claimed by Moore were merely “gimmicks,” that included declining to fill vacant government jobs, transferring funds from special accounts and shifting some costs to local governments.
“Governor Moore has presided over the largest tax hike in Maryland history and a relentless barrage of new fees on working families,” read the caucus statement. “No speech can spin those facts away.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Tuesday, Moore held up the taxes, fees and spending cuts as an example of “fiscal discipline,” though it came out of necessity in his third year in office. The General Assembly convened in January — less than two weeks before Trump’s inauguration — with the knowledge that it would need to resolve the $3.3 billion gap between spending and revenue before it could adjourn 90 days later.
“We were able to make those smart, strategic cuts while also giving the middle class a tax cut — and yes, asking those who have done very well to invest a little bit more so we could actually have the best public schools and have safe streets,” Moore said of tax increases on higher-income earners.
Moore’s reelection announcement comes amid persistent rumors that he plans to run for president in 2028 — a rumor that Moore has repeatedly dismissed, including on a Sunday appearance on “Meet the Press.”
“I have never once said that I am interested,” Moore said Tuesday of the presidency. “So when people say ‘Are you ruling it out?’ my point is I’ve never ruled it in. I’ve been focused on this job. And I appreciate the fact that people in Maryland and that people around the country are paying attention to the progress we’ve made.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC02577-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 22:56:37.427039

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Laura Pope will teach an eight-week class at Baltimore City Community College through Oct. 17 this semester, but said she won’t get paid until May 2026.
“We’re basically working without getting paid,” said Pope, who has worked at the college since 2013 and is currently a professor of English, communications and humanities. “Administration started a policy where, instead of getting paid in the semester when we teach a class, we don’t get paid until” later in the school year.
Hers was one of many grievances that professors brought to a rally Tuesday to protest the fact that almost a year after unionizing they still have no contract with the college. A few dozen faculty, students, union leaders and other supporters at the rally had a simple message: Pay staff fair and timely wages.
For the past several years, rallygoers said, some faculty have received pay that was a few weeks to several months late. Union leaders said some employees endure inaccurate payments, or none at all. When classes started on Aug. 25, union leaders said, more than 50 had no instructor.

“This is unacceptable and causes unnecessary disruptions and barriers to the academic progress of our students,” said Angelique Cook-Hayes, an assistant professor of English at the college for more than 12 years.
“These issues have damaged our college community and have occurred for far too long. It is time for the community to stand together and speak out,” Cook-Hayes said.
To address the problems, full-time faculty at the college certified United Academics of Maryland in October 2024, an affiliate of American Federal of Teachers-Maryland.
AFT Maryland President Kenya Campbell said Tuesday she hopes college administration does right by the staff.
“We want to be a partner in this work. We have a couple of ideas, but again, we’re not the ones cutting the check,” she said. “But I think we have enough experience and ideas that we can talk it through and find a really, really good, effective resolution to the problem.”
After rallying for about 25 minutes, faculty and supporters walked to the administration building to deliver a list of demands to College President Debra McCurdy. They were greeted instead by Michael Thomas, the vice president of workforce development and continuing education, who took the list from Ryan Castle, AFT Maryland higher ed organizer, before everyone left the lobby.
The list of requests includes:

Timely and accurate pay for all faculty, including overload and adjunct work;
Transparent communication and accountability from BCCC administration;
Hiring and staffing solutions to fill vacant courses and reduce student impact; and
Support for all faculty and respect for collective bargaining rights.

Shortly after the rally, the college released a statement to acknowledge and “respect” the faculty union’s right to rally to express its priorities.
“The College remains committed to the collective bargaining process and is negotiating in good faith to reach a fair and sustainable agreement that recognizes the invaluable contributions of our faculty,” the statement said. “We believe that a successful resolution must be one that not only provides competitive wages and benefits but also ensures the long-term financial health of the College for the benefit of all members of our community — including our students, staff, and taxpayers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But it went on to say that “we firmly believe the most productive path forward is at the bargaining table. We urge the union’s leadership to continue engaging with us constructively so we can conclude these negotiations and provide stability for our faculty and the entire College community.”
McCurdy was not a focus of the rally — her name was only mentioned once, as rallying faculty walked to deliver the list of demands — but she was clearly on the minds of some union leaders Tuesday.
“I don’t know if the president or the leader of this institution is missing paychecks, but I highly doubt it,” said Baltimore AFL-CIO President Courtney Jenkins. “I bet if they did, this issue would not be an issue.”
One particular issue is the lack of specialized supplies, like jackets, for students in the dental hygiene program, said Gwen Farmer, a clinical instructor in the dental hygiene clinic. Farmer, an adjunct professor at the college, also recalled being paid about two months late.
“I come here not for the money. I come here to teach and educate, and like to be compensated and get a little something for doing it right,” said Farmer, a 2000 graduate of the college who works in a dental office and does dental hygiene work at nursing homes.
Campbell, the AFT president, said she remains hopeful.
“I’m hoping that they have heard our loud voices. They have seen our presence and, more importantly, the demands that we had in writing that we handed over to them,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rally-at-BCCC-9-9-2025-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-09 22:56:37.427039

(Photo by Jed Workman/Provided by U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Since the 1990s, well-heeled visitors have flocked to Valdez for some of the most famous adventures in the skiing world: guided helicopter tours to long, steep mountain slopes with untouched powder and stunning views of the Prince William Sound scenery.
The Valdez heli-skiing industry is an economic boon to the coastal city of roughly 3,700 that is otherwise best known for the marine terminal of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. But the growing industry  has its drawbacks as well, like avalanche risks, noise, environmental degradation and potential conflicts with others recreating or traveling in the backcountry of the Chugach Mountains.
Now federal regulators are considering whether to continue permitted operations mostly as they have occurred over the past decade or make some changes.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Aug. 27 released a draft environmental assessment to guide the next decade of’ heli-skiing activities. The draft proposes that up to eight operators be allowed to obtain permits for the next 10 seasons, which run from January to May during the years from 2026 to 2035.
The BLM is seeking public comments on the draft through Sept. 25.
So far, six companies have already applied for permits to operate over that period; four of them are seeking permit renewals and two companies are new to the area.
The environmental assessment started last year. It is intended to produce a decision about whether to grant those 10-year permits and if so, whether to attach some new conditions.
The process concerns only lands in the area that the BLM owns and manages. The U.S. Forest Service and state of Alaska own other lands in the area that are used for heliskiing, but their permitting is separate.
The BLM is going through the environmental assessment now because the current 10-year special use permits for heli-skiing operators are expiring, said Gordon Claggett, an agency spokesperson.
“To authorize the next phase of special recreation permits, we have to go through an environmental review process,” he said by email. “Applications drive the environmental review.”
The BLM manages about 150,000 acres in the area considered suitable for heli-skiing, of which 133,800 is considered available for that activity. The remainder is closed to protect wildlife.
In the spring of 2024, the BLM received a flurry of public comments, both supportive and critical of Valdez-area heli-skiing, during what is called the scoping period, the preliminary step in the environmental review.
Some commenters argued in favor of an increase in the number of heli-skiing permits, citing economic benefits. Others argued for more restrictions, saying the heli-skiing companies operating now have caused numerous conflicts and negative effects.
The agency’s draft environmental assessment acknowledges those user conflicts and says they might increase as winter recreation expands, though they are likely to vary according to snow and weather conditions.
“The greatest level of conflict would potentially occur on days when the weather is clear and there is adequate snow and cooler temperatures that create ideal conditions for both heli-skiers and backcountry skiers and both user groups are in the area at the same time,” it says.

But they didn’t get an Indiana-like pitch about redistricting a red state. (Al Drago/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Thirteen Nebraska state lawmakers visited Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. But they didn’t get an Indiana-like pitch about redistricting a red state, as reporters waited. 
Instead, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs hosted lawmakers from Nebraska and Iowa to “hear firsthand” how President Donald Trump and his team are implementing his approach and how to “advance it at the state and local level.” 
While that was the official reason, national and local news outlets reported in recent days that Trump’s team might use the meeting to discuss mid-decade redistricting with Nebraska lawmakers.
People familiar with how the meeting unfolded told the Examiner on Tuesday that redistricting wasn’t discussed, partly because of the attention surrounding the gathering. The White House had considered talking to lawmakers in small groups about it, but didn’t. 
Some of the same sources said the conversations could still happen, but that it was a little too early in the process to risk a leaked discussion. 
The conference featured cabinet secretaries, White House senior staff and people working for various federal agencies and departments. The invitation said they would get to ask federal officials questions.  
Among the Nebraska state senators attending were Loren Lippincott of Central City, Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, Dave Murman of Glenville, Barry DeKay of Niobrara, Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, Beau Ballard of Lincoln, Paul Strommen of Sidney, Rob Clements of Elmwood, Ben Hansen of Blair, Brian Hardin of Gering, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County and Barry DeKay of Niobrara.

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, confirmed that the governor’s chief of staff and policy director both attended the meeting, saying that their presence was typical for such White House summits. 
“Team Pillen has worked hard to build relationships throughout President Trump’s administration, and we are always excited for opportunities to strengthen our partnership,” Strimple said. 
The four-hour conference touched on Trump tariffs, college accreditation and how it’s determined, expanding school choice, reining in college costs and reducing student debt and election integrity.

White House staff also discussed how the Trump Small Business Administration is reducing regulations, said Lippincott, who spoke with the Examiner while flying back to Nebraska. 
Lippincott said the group talked about getting rid of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or DEI, and someone from the Trump Administration talked about how “we need to go to paper ballots,” for which President Donald Trump recently expressed support. The president also has said states should stop using ballots by mail and voting machines, which election experts have defended as reliable. 
Kauth told the Examiner the gathering was “just a meeting of federal and state government leaders to develop better communication and relationships.”
The pause in a White House pitch to redistrict Nebraska in time for the 2026 midterms  — to make the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District harder for Democrats to win — comes during the ramp-up of a national redistricting tit for tat that Trump helped start in Texas. Texas lawmakers recently approved a new map designed to help the GOP win up to five additional seats in the U.S. House next year. 
The White House pressed Indiana state lawmakers about redistricting during a visit to the nation’s capital last month. The Missouri House passed its own redrawn congressional map, which targets a Kansas City-area House district currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. 
Democratic-led states are considering pursuing partisan redistricting efforts in response, including in California and New York. 
While Republicans hold all three of Nebraska’s congressional seats, political experts see the now open-seat 2nd District race as a potential pickup for Democrats in 2026. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has announced he would not run again.
Another hurdle for any Nebraska redistricting push: Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Legislature might lack the numbers needed to make the change. One Nebraska GOP state lawmaker questioned privately whether a mid-decade redistricting effort would have 25 votes.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista didn’t attend the D.C. meeting. Also, one of the key GOP holdouts who helped stop last year’s push to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president, Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, didn’t attend, citing scheduling conflicts. He has said he’s “not a big fan of changing the rules in the middle of the game.” And Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who opposed the winner-take-all push, didn’t attend. 
But Pillen has shown a willingness to try even when he lacks the votes. He pressed for the Legislature to take up winner-take-all without the votes.

Kirkmeyer, a 66-year-old Weld County Republican, currently serves on the powerful Joint Budget Committee in the Colorado Legislature. She ran to represent Colorado’s 8th Congressional District in 2022. 
“Colorado is ready for a new direction,” Kirkmeyer said at a campaign launch event Tuesday in Fort Lupton. “It’s ready to chart a new path. It’s ready for a common sense conservative leader who will roll up her sleeves, work with people, and deliver real results, not play political games.”

Before she was first elected to the state Senate in 2020, Kirkmeyer served as a Weld County commissioner, when she helped lead a plan among several northern Colorado counties to secede from the state. She lost her bid to represent the 8th District to Democrat Yadira Caraveo by less than a full percentage point. 
As a member of the JBC, she is heavily involved in crafting the state’s budget each year and is typically a bipartisan sponsor of many budgetary bills. She also sponsored a bipartisan measure this year that reformed Colorado’s process for filling vacancies in the Legislature, and she touts her work on major property tax cuts during the 2024 legislative session.










Colorado is ready for a new direction ... It's ready to chart a new path. It's ready for a common sense conservative leader who will roll up her sleeves, work with people, and deliver real results, not play political games.


– State Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, Colorado governor candidate


If elected, Kirkmeyer said she would defend Colorado’s Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which restricts state tax revenue collection and spending, and ensure taxes are not raised. She criticized the Legislature’s most recent special session, which she said “was not a special session about fixing the budget” but was “about increasing taxes.” She also wants to see the state support small businesses “without government red tape.” 
Colorado Republicans supporting Kirkmeyer at her campaign kick off included state Reps. Carlos Barron of Fort Lupton, Ryan Gonzalez of Greeley and Dan Woog of Erie, as well as state Sen. Byron Pelton of Sterling and Colorado State Board of Education member Yazmin Navarro.

Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has been in office since 2019, is term-limited in 2026. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running on the Democratic side of the race. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election, and Polis won reelection in 2022 by nearly 20 percentage points.
‘A different vision for Colorado’
Kirkmeyer is loyal to Republican President Donald Trump, “not Colorado families,” Ben Waldon, Bennet’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
“She backed Trump’s reckless bill that will strip health care from tens of thousands and shut down Colorado rural hospitals and nursing homes, and she’s all in on Trump’s economic agenda, already a disaster for Colorado families, workers, and small businesses,” Waldon said, referring to the GOP’s domestic policy megabill, which Trump signed in July. 
Weiser said Kirkmeyer tried to stop him from “defending our state” against Trump administration policies, but he welcomed her to the race and said he looks forward to “a debate about the values and leadership Colorado needs and deserves in this moment.”
“I have a different vision for Colorado — focused on freedom and opportunity for all — and will fight hard for it,” Weiser said in a statement. 
Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said Kirkmeyer is “eager to please” Republican party donors and blasted her defense of Colorado Republicans in Congress for supporting the Republican megabill. 
Other prominent Republican candidates who have announced a run for governor include state Sen. Mark Baisley, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, former U.S. Rep. Greg Lopez and Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, among several others. Kirkmeyer said her experience leading a state agency under Republican Gov. Bill Owens, as a county commissioner, and as a member of the JBC sets her apart from other Republican candidates in the race.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)MITCHELL — As China boycotts U.S. soybean purchases, a $500 million processing plant south of Mitchell that will turn more of the state’s crop into oils and livestock meal opened its doors Tuesday.
Tom Kersting, the CEO of South Dakota Soybean Processors, which manages the plant, said it will help stabilize prices and create local demand.
“If it wasn’t for demand sources like this facility, it’d be very, very tough out there,” Kersting said, calling China, until now, the number one buyer of South Dakota’s exported beans.
China is avoiding U.S. soybeans this fall in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

The High Plains Processing Plant is designed to crush about 35 million bushels of soybeans per year. South Dakota farmers produced about 238 million bushels last year. Kersting said the facility will produce soybean meal (animal feed) and soybean oil. The oil can be refined on-site into vegetable oil or a soybean-based diesel fuel, called renewable diesel.
“There’s great demand for soybean oil from the renewable fuels industry,” he said. “And soybean meal is the preferred high-protein feed additive for hogs, poultry, dairy — you name it.” 
Craig Weber is the president of the South Dakota Soybean Processors board. He said the project’s impact will be most immediate on the gap between the bean price and what farmers actually receive. That gap is significantly impacted by transportation costs, and the new plant being in Mitchell reduces those costs for farmers in the region.
Still, farm advocates cautioned that one facility cannot fully offset the loss of the world’s largest soybean buyer. 
“No, it’s not going to be enough,” said Doug Sombke, president of South Dakota Farmers Union. 
Sombke and a delegation of about 40 farmers were in Washington, D.C., earlier this week to express their concerns to Congress. 
“It helps, yeah, but it’s going to take a lot more,” Sombke said. “Farmers are in a lot of trouble. We’re going to lose farmers if we don’t do something quick.”
Governor Larry Rhoden, who spoke at the opening, called the project an example of the kind of value-added agriculture South Dakota should pursue. 
“We’re talking about enhancing our number one industry, which is agriculture,” he said. 
He also praised the plant’s ability to process other oilseeds, like sunflowers, offering farmers more flexibility depending on circumstances in the crop markets.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A former South Dakota Department of Health employee was sentenced to two years of probation and a $500 fine Tuesday in Hughes County Court for illegally issuing herself a medical marijuana card.
Alexandra Feiner, 24, of Pierre, had pleaded guilty earlier to one felony count of offering a false or forged instrument for filing, registering or recording.
The crime occurred in March 2024. By issuing a card to herself, Feiner illegally avoided both the medical provider certification requirement and a required fee.
She received a suspended imposition of sentence, which means she’ll avoid two years in prison if she abides by the terms of her probation.
Feiner’s case is one of six that Attorney General Marty Jackley has prosecuted against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work for state government.
“There are 14,000 state government employees in South Dakota and the overwhelming majority work hard for South Dakota,” Jackley said Tuesday in a news release. “The behavior of one should not reflect poorly on the majority.”

The other five cases ranged from the illegal use of a foster family food voucher for a state employee’s own expenses, to the stealing of $1.8 million from the Department of Social Services over the course of 13 years.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order in April mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal delivers whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A motion to subpoena the former secretary of the Arkansas Department of Corrections failed on a voice vote of senators on the Joint Performance Review Committee during a hearing Tuesday on alleged impropriety in the site selection process for the Franklin County prison.
Multiple legislators voiced anger over Joe Profiri’s absence at the hearing, which was called in response to a petition by Adam Watson and Natalie Cadena, members of a coalition of opponents to the location of the 3,000-bed prison near Charleston.
The committee did not take any action during the four-hour hearing, with JPR Co-Chair Sen. Terry Rice of Waldron saying the hearing was primarily informational and for the sake of “transparency.” He thanked Watson and Cadena for their presentation.
Joe Profiri
The Board of Corrections fired Profiri at the beginning of 2024 after weeks of tensions between him and board members. After he was fired, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders hired him to advise her on corrections matters — but Watson and Cadena alleged in their petition and during the hearing that Profiri is still deeply involved in running the department. Sanders tapped Lindsay Wallace, Profiri’s then chief of staff, as his replacement, and the board agreed to hire her.
Watson said Profiri’s continued involvement in the proposed prison after Wallace’s appointment amounts to duplication of two high-salaried positions.
Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, expressed frustration over water supply issues at the site and anger over Profiri’s failure to appear before the committee despite being invited by committee co-chairs Rice and Rep. Bruce Cozart of Hot Springs. Wooten said he is “for the prison,” but after hearing the detailed presentation from Watson and Cadena, he said “the location we picked is the wrong one.” He criticized selecting the site without the many preliminary tests necessary to determine if the site was truly viable, such as soil testing.
“Somebody needs to kick the chair back and tell the governor how it is,” Wooten said. “For one, I’m furious about the fact that Mr. [Profiri], whatever his name is, from Arizona, didn’t get here. … Committee members, that’s a slap at every one of you that the governor’s office is not here.”
“I think it is a slap at this body not to even answer us and say he cannot be here,” Rice said.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Sanders, said her office would continue to meet with legislators to answer questions and get the prison built.
“The Governor’s Office provided the committee with two experts [from the Division of Building Authority] who have been intimately involved in the Franklin County prison project, and since the announcement of the new prison, the Governor’s team has held a town hall in Franklin County to answer questions from the community and has been in contact with Franklin County leaders,” Dubke said in a text message.
Many local community members, however, remain adamantly against the prison’s location, accusing the state of not talking with them nor listening to their concerns. That anger drove the petition submitted by Watson and Cadena. Their complaint argues that:

“It is improper for Arkansas taxpayers to be burdened with supporting the salary of two leaders of the Department of Corrections.”
“It is an improper use of taxpayer funds to pay a consultant for a task while simultaneously having an unqualified state agency perform the same task.”
“Expending taxpayer funds on a capital project without funding for such [a] project is irresponsible and improper.”
“Failing to conduct proper due diligence on real property prior to its purchase is irresponsible and improper.”

Watson and Cadena’s presentation primarily focused on point four — whether the state had done proper due diligence when selecting the site. They argued the area didn’t have sufficient infrastructure — from water sources to suitable roads to a sufficient workforce — to support a prison for 3,000 people, and that the state didn’t conduct any adequate testing until after the purchase of the 810-acre property.
They presented legislators in attendance with internal communications and documents obtained via the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act that they said showed due diligence had not been done. By the end of the presentation, some lawmakers expressed their concerns, but many remained silent.
Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, who represents parts of Franklin County, said that if half of what Watson and Cadena presented to the committee was accurate, then he didn’t believe the state had done what it needed to do.
“I don’t think we should expect our state employees necessarily to have the expertise to make these decisions,” Eubanks said, adding that he wasn’t blaming state employees for that. “There seems to be an unwillingness to even consider another site at this point, and I don’t understand that either.”
Rep. Brit McKenzie, R-Rogers, asked Anne Laidlaw, director of the Division of Building Authority, and Shelby Johnson, who heads the geographic information services office, whether they had been asked to consider other sites for the prison since Sanders announced the decision to locate the prison in Franklin County last year. They said no.
Republican Sen. Jimmy Hickey Jr. of Texarkana said he was at the hearing to find a way to vote to fund the prison’s construction, “but all I’m doing is getting further and further and further away.” An appropriations bill to fund prison construction, authored by Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang of Searcy, was voted down in the Senate five times before the 2025 regular session ended earlier this year. Hickey voted no each time.
“Obviously, with what’s come out, this isn’t going to work,” Hickey said. “I heard you say earlier that” an existing water line “had the potential” to supply the prison, “well, the potential is going to cost how much more now?”
Some of the criticism relating to the prison site came from allegations that the state didn’t follow its own site selection criteria. Watson pointed to criteria for community buy-in as a chief example of this. Watson and Cadena also argued that DBA staff were not qualified to do the site selection.
Johnson and Laidlaw said they made recommendations on the site, but didn’t make the final decision. And Johnson pushed back on Watson’s assertion that his staff wasn’t qualified, rattling off the academic credentials of the eight staffers who worked on evaluating sites for the prison.
“I have one registered forester on staff. I have one person on my staff that’s a level four certified appraiser from the Assessment Coordination Division. And I also have two licensed surveyors,” Johnson said, in addition to multiple master’s and bachelor’s degrees in a variety of fields. “When we put that team all together, I have over 100 years of combined experience … I would like to make sure that the committee is aware that we, we did have experience.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5300-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 21:57:21.168063

Tim Walz spoke with reporters after meeting with legislative leaders on Sept. 9, 2025. The governor said he will call a special session on gun control. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer) Gov. Tim Walz said he will call a special legislative session to push for gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, even if he isn’t able to strike a deal with lawmakers.
“I will call a special session one way or another,” Walz told reporters Tuesday after meeting with Republican and Democratic legislative leaders behind closed doors. “Just have the hope. Just bring it up. Have the discussion … Maybe it doesn’t pass because the numbers aren’t there but at least we’re going to know.”
The governor typically calls a special session once lawmakers agree on what bills will be passed and the duration of the session. Walz has the sole ability to call a special session, but only lawmakers can gavel themselves out, which is typically why the governor and lawmakers come to an agreement beforehand.
By pushing ahead with what could be a quixotic effort in the face of GOP intransigence on new gun laws, Walz is signaling that he’s looking to get Republicans on the record on gun proposals — and especially an assault weapons ban — even if there’s no hope for legislation, which could translate into a rancorous session.
Walz said he will propose a gun control package in the coming days. It will include a ban on the heavy weaponry frequently used in mass shootings and often referred to as assault weapons.
Republicans — who are strongly aligned with the gun rights movement and led by Speaker Lisa Demuth —  have 67 members in the Minnesota House, while Democrats have 66 in their ranks following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. After a Sept. 16 special election, the House is expected to return to a tie.
The Minnesota Senate also has two absences after the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, R-Buffalo, and the resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury. Any bill needs 34 votes to pass, meaning all 33 Democrats would need to vote together with at least one Republican joining them.
This means that any legislation proposed in a special session will need bipartisan approval.
Senate Democrats voting in a unified bloc for gun control is no sure thing; at least three Democratic senators — Grant Hauschild of Hermantown, Rob Kupec of Moorhead and Judy Seeberger of Afton — have been difficult to pin down on where they stand on an assault weapons ban. 
Walz is hoping that the shooting of a church filled with schoolchildren will pressure at least a few Republicans to vote for gun control, perhaps suburban members concerned about voters’ anger with their inaction. Demuth said she would need to look at specific bill language before she could say if her caucus would vote for it.
“House Republicans are committed to making sure that we are keeping our schools and our communities safe,” Demuth said.
Her caucus last week released a “school safety agenda” in response to the Annunciation shooting that didn’t include any proposals on gun control. Instead, they called for increased funding for school safety at private schools, boosting funding for more mental health treatment beds and increasing penalties for repeat firearm offenders. Their agenda also includes reversing a conversion therapy ban for minors, which would allow therapists to try to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender.
DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson, whose caucus elected him their new leader Monday, said in his first appearance that he hopes Republicans will listen to the families affected by gun violence because they are demanding lawmakers take action.
“The reason I’m standing before you all right now is because of an act of gun violence,” said Stephenson, referring to Hortman’s assassination. “That’s the reason I’m here.” Hortman had been a mentor to Stephenson since he was a young man.
Walz and legislative leaders will continue to meet behind closed doors to see if they can come to a pre-session agreement.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In an unprecedented move, New Mexico is making child care free.
Beginning in November, it will be the first state in the nation to provide child care to all residents regardless of income, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced this week.
The state has been working to lower child care care costs since 2019, when it created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department and started to expand eligibility for universal child care. This latest change removes income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments.
The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually.
“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of $13,000 on child care annually. It’s much higher in many states.
In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years.
The state’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support.
The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion. Latinas in New Mexico led the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said.
The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour.
The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options.
Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dow told the Albuquerque Journal that she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state’s child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported.
But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation.
“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we’ll be one of the first to apply.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/child-care2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 21:57:21.168063

The Trump administration in August demanded 46 states and territories remove all references to gender ideology in a federally-funded program that provides health education to adolescents, or risk losing grants. 
Montana has 60 days to remove the flagged content and submit a copy of modified materials for approval, or could forfeit up to $539,601 according to Department of Health and Human Services data. 
Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for DPHHS, told the Daily Montanan in an email that the department did not develop the program’s educational materials, and would comply with the federal request. 
“In the coming weeks, we will ensure that the curriculum is modified by our grantees in accordance with ACF guidance,” Ebelt said. “In addition, the Gianforte administration does not believe that minor children should be taught gender ideology.”
The Personal Responsibility Education Program was authorized by Congress in 2010 to help reduce teen pregnancies to the tune of $75 million annually. The programs are administered on a state level and are expected to be “evidence-based, provide education on both abstinence and contraceptive use, and educate youth on at least three of six adulthood preparation topics,” according to the federal Administration for Children and Families.  
Earlier this year, the administration requested each state, tribal and competitive grant recipient to provide curriculum and programmatic materials related to their respective PREP grant programs “for a medical accuracy review” and program compliance. 
“ACF has a statutory duty to ensure the content being taught in federally funded PREP programs is medically accurate and age appropriate,” ACF Acting Assistant Secretary Andrew Gradison said in a press statement in April. “Parents have a right to know what their children are being taught, and the American people deserve transparency about how their tax dollars are being spent.”
After reviewing the programs, ACF requested 46 states and territories, including Montana, update their programmatic materials to remove references to gender ideology or risk forfeiting their federal funding. 
California already lost its grant — worth $12.5 million — after the state refused to comply with the orders. 
In Montana, the Department of Public Health and Human Services administers a PREP program called Optimal Health for Montana Youth. 
The program defines optimal health as encompassing five different areas — physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual — and the program uses that framework to approach sex education and teen pregnancy prevention. 
According to DPHHS, local county public health nurses and educators work with schools to teach healthy relationship and communication skills, adolescent development, and other life skills through the Optimal Health program, and around 1,400 students are served through the program annually. 
An ACF overview of Montana’s PREP program indicates that the target population is “American Indian and white youth, ages 10 to 19, in the juvenile justice system, alternative schools, Job Corps and youth who are pregnant/parenting under 21 years of age.” The curriculum is implemented in schools, reservations, juvenile justice, addiction services and community based settings in Silver Bow, Custer, Rosebud, Deer Lodge, Flathead and Missoula Counties. 
In a letter to DHPPS Community Health Section Supervisor Darla Dexter, Acting Secretary Gradison stated that references to gender ideology fell outside the scope of authorized subjects. 
 Among the issues the federal government found in Montana’s curriculum was a recommendation against dividing classes by gender “as it can cause trauma for transgender, gender non-conforming, and nonbinary youth;” emphasizing how “teens of all sexual orientations and gender identities need to learn how to draw the line to resist sexual pressure and protect themselves;” and discussions on preferred pronouns, and respecting the differences in each individual, including their gender identity and gender expression. 
The letter states that gender ideology “is both irrelevant to teaching abstinence and contraception and unrelated to any of the adult preparation subjects,” allowed in PREP curriculum. 
“The statute neither requires, supports nor authorizes teaching students that gender identity is distinct from biological sex or that boys can identify as girls and vice versa; thus, gender ideology is outside the scope of the authorizing statute and any expenditures associated with gender ideology are not allowable, reasonable, or allocable to the PREP grant,” the letter states. 
Previous curricula for Montana’s PREP programs had been approved by the federal government, which Gradison described as an error in the prior administration.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HS1A0013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 20:56:54.262226

Gerry Connolly in Virginia’s 11th Congressional District, narrowing Republicans’ majority in the House of Representatives to six seats. The Associated Press called the race in Walkinshaw’s favor at 7:36 p.m., with the Democrat taking 74.9% of the vote compared to Republican contender Stewart Whitson’s 25.1%.
Live election results: Virginia’s 11th Congressional District special election

Connolly endorsed Walkinshaw, his former chief of staff, before he died in May.
Walkinshaw, who also serves on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, defeated Whitson in a suburban Washington D.C. district that Democrats have held since Connolly first won the seat in 2008.
President Donald Trump figured heavily into Walkinshaw’s campaign. In one ad, Walkinshaw described the election as “our first chance to send a Democrat to Congress since Trump took office again.” He has presented himself as a counterweight to Trump’s agenda on everything from DOGE to the president’s Big Beautiful Bill. 
The district’s proximity to the capital loomed large in his race, with Walkinshaw denouncing Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce and his deployment of National Guard troops to D.C.
Whitson, an Army veteran who works for a conservative think tank, faced daunting odds in a district Kamala Harris won by more than 30 points last year. He was also outflanked in fundraising, capturing less than a quarter of the more than $1 million raised by Walkinshaw.
Whitson’s rhetoric followed Trumpian themes, calling for an end to “waste, fraud and abuse” and describing the U.S. Department of Education as a “failed experiment.”
Like Walkinshaw, Connolly was a former Congressional staffer turned Fairfax supervisor. He won a 2008 race to replace longtime Republican Rep. Tom Davis, fended off a close Republican challenge in 2010, and won the ensuing elections by large margins as Northern Virginia became more solidly Democratic. 
Connolly announced he’d been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in November, 2024, days after being reelected. In April, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee said he would not run for re-election and endorsed Walkinshaw shortly thereafter. Connolly died a few weeks later.
After over 30 years of public service, Virginia Congressman Gerry Connolly dies at 75

Walkinshaw’s campaign briefly drew national attention after Connolly’s social media accounts reiterated those endorsements after the Democrat’s death, in the midst of the ensuing nine-person primary. Walkinshaw emerged with nearly 60% of the vote.
As a supervisor, Walkinshaw voted against adopting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s model policies for public schools which aimed to limit transgender students’ access to bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. He backed a plan to replace a county parking lot with 279 units of affordable housing, and drove a successful effort to replace the county’s gas-powered leaf blowers with electric ones.
In Congress, Walkinshaw has pledged to work to ban assault-style weapons, expand federal non-discrimination protections, protect victims of sexual assault and eliminate partisan gerrymandering. 
Walkinshaw differs from his former boss on at least one policy item: crypto. Walkinshaw received a $1 million boost in broadcast ads from the crypto lobbying group Protect Progress, Axios reported in June, and touts blockchain as a transformative technology on his campaign website. Connolly consistently voted against industry-backed legislation.

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderA Fulton County judge says he is likely to throw out racketeering charges filed against 61 people in connection with an alleged conspiracy to stop the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center because the Georgia Attorney General’s office lacked authority to bring the charges. 
Georgia law specifies the circumstances when the Attorney General’s office may engage in criminal prosecution that might otherwise be handled by a local district attorney. To prosecute charges under Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, the attorney general’s office must seek authorization from the governor’s office. Deputy Attorney General John Fowler acknowledged that step had not been taken. 
However, Fowler argued that it was not required due to a state agency, the Georgia State Patrol, being a victim in two acts that the prosecution claims are related to the alleged conspiracy – a 2020 fire at a Georgia State Patrol building that the prosecution claims was set by protesters and the 2023 shooting of a Georgia State Patrol trooper in the South River Forest near the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. A protester, Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, was killed by the Georgia State Patrol in the same incident. 
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer was unconvinced that these two incidents gave the attorney general’s office jurisdiction without the governor’s authorization. Farmer said the 2020 fire alone does not give the attorney general’s office authority to pursue the racketeering charges. He additionally noted that while the 2023 shooting is mentioned in the indictment, it is not claimed to be an act that furthered the alleged conspiracy to stop construction of the training center.  
Gov. Brian Kemp praised the indictments at the time. 
“I think it would have been real easy to ask the governor, let me do this, give me a letter,” Farmer said from the bench Tuesday. “The mechanisms were in place. And the steps just weren’t followed. It’s not that he couldn’t have gotten that letter, there are mechanisms in place whereby he could have brought this.” 
Tuesday’s hearing dealt another blow to the indictment following a difficult hearing for the prosecution on Monday. Farmer compared parts of the indictment to a “bad political science paper” and repeatedly scolded the state’s attorneys on their unfamiliarity with parts of the indictment.  
The sprawling indictment, pending since September 2023, also includes charges of domestic terrorism and arson brought against five of the 61 defendants. Court resumes Wednesday morning to discuss how, or if, Farmer will dismiss those additional charges. 
Fowler stated in court that the court’s findings are “wholly incorrect” and that the attorney general’s office intends to immediately appeal the court’s ruling once it is finalized.
The Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, often called Cop City by its opponents, formally opened in 2024 following years of protests both in the streets and in front of the Atlanta City Council. Opponents to the project have long criticized it as a symbol of what they see as an increasingly militarized police force, and on environmental grounds. Gubernatorial candidate and current Attorney General Chris Carr has long been a strong supporter of the project. 
The Southern Center for Human Rights, which paired many of the defendants in the case with an attorney through its First Amendment Lawyer Bridge program, applauded the decision.
“We are grateful for the zealous representation provided by the attorneys in this case in defense of their clients and the First Amendment right to dissent. Whether paired by the Bridge or not, SCHR depends on our colleagues in the bar willing to stand firm in the face of political repression,” Tiffany Roberts, director of the center’s public policy unit, said in a statement.
The case is believed to be the largest criminal racketeering case ever filed against protesters in U.S. history.

Pharmacies can provide boosters to individuals who qualify, but the state is awaiting a looming CDC recommendation to better understand what government insurance can cover.

Despite new federal limits on who can get a Covid-19 vaccine and the arrival of the cold and flu season, many Vermonters can still get a booster, though details surrounding Medicare reimbursement and federal recommendations remain uncertain.
In a late August post on X, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Food and Drug Administration approved Covid-19 booster shots, but only for those 65 and above or with existing health risks. 
Vermont state officials are now awaiting a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which typically guides public health directives and insurers’ coverage, for those who want to get a fall booster shot.  
“Really the best thing that I can recommend is either to go online and see if you can set up an online appointment (for a vaccine), or call pharmacies in your area to see if they’re available,” said Julie Arel, the state’s interim commissioner of health.
In Vermont, pharmacies are moving forward with administering the vaccine. Kinney Drugs and CVS have the updated Covid vaccines in stock. Pharmacies order directly from the manufacturer. Providers — doctors’ offices and other clinics — often get vaccines through the state, which is not yet able to order the vaccines from the CDC. 
Kinney Drugs’ spokesperson Alice Maggiore confirmed that the stores can administer the 2025-26 vaccines to people above 65 and individuals between 12 and 64 who attest to having one of the qualifying conditions, as outlined by the CDC. 
CVS is able to vaccinate anyone over 5 years old, who attests to eligibility under the same CDC’s preexisting conditions list, or anyone older than 65, according to a company executive, Amy Thibault. 
The underlying risks outlined by the CDC range from asthma or a smoking history to mental health disorders, like depression obesity, or physical inactivity. Patients do not need a doctor’s prescription to confirm the underlying condition at Kinney or CVS, both spokespeople said.
Typically, insurers cover vaccines received in a pharmacy. Whether some private and government insurers will be able to cover the vaccines remains uncertain. Even if people can get the vaccine by walking into a pharmacy, it’s unclear if they will have to pay for it:  “It’s a little bit mind boggling,” Arel said. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state’s largest private insurer, plans to continue to cover the vaccine for any member, at no cost and with no prior approval, said Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer. Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT intends to do so through 2026, as well. MVP, the state’s other private insurer selling plans on the marketplace, also does not anticipate changes in its vaccine coverage policy, said Elizabeth Boody, a spokesperson for the company. 
What employer-sponsored insurers and providers like Tricare, the military health system, might be able to cover, is still unclear.
Since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65, it is likely that Medicare, which covers the same age group, will cover the vaccines. Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco, told NBC News that once the FDA approves a vaccine, Medicare has the authority to cover it.
Generally a Covid vaccine undergoes three steps for approval: First the FDA authorizes the new vaccines — which it did in August. Then a panel within the CDC called ACIP (short for Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) issues a recommendation on the vaccine. It is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19, to do so. This year many are holding their breath ahead of ACIP’s announcement, since Kennedy gutted the panel and replaced it with many vaccine skeptics. 
The state is weighing whether and how it will need to break from that typical process, and is currently exploring what Vermont statute allows for breaking with that process.
While it is quite common for providers to prescribe a drug outside of what the FDA has authorized them for, it’s not typical, however, for that to happen with vaccines. The FDA’s lack of formal guidance on what qualifies as an underlying condition leaves room for interpretation surrounding who qualifies for the vaccine.
“There’s some flexibility in there, but because it’s not as clear as usual, there is going to be hesitancy, in all likelihood,” said Arel. “And anytime there’s hesitancy, anytime there’s confusion, it’s going to lead to lower immunization rates. We really want to try to avoid that.”
The Department of Health is also looking to Vermont’s neighbors in the Northeast for direction, Arel said. In August, the department joined with other state health departments in the region to build a coalition ready to respond to shifts in federal guidance. Though the group has no unified recommendation, she says it’s something they are considering to help mediate the current disjunctive state of vaccine recommendations and approvals. 
“If as a region, we can become more aligned, it helps people across the whole Northeast region to feel a level of confidence in their state public health department’s decisions and how we’re moving forward,” she said.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healy required in-state insurance carriers to cover the vaccines recommended by the state’s Department of Public Health, even if they are outside of the federal recommendations. The state’s commissioner of public health also issued a standing order that allows pharmacists to issue Covid shots to anyone over the age of 5. 
In response, Arel said Vermont is watching its neighbors and looking into where state statute might allow for potential action. 
“Getting clarity and having a message be clear and simple, is going to be the most important thing we do,” Arel said. “Unfortunately, we are still working through all of that, but we are committed to finding our way through it and making it as simple and easy as possible.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Days before sentencing, a federal judge threw out three charges against former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren but kept more than a dozen convictions in place, according to news reports.
In a phone hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson determined prosecutors failed to prove that Casada and Cothren were guilty of public corruption and operated as agents of the government, the reports show. 
Casada remains convicted on 14 counts and Cothren on 16 counts after a jury found them guilty in May of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering. One fraud conviction alone comes with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Their attorneys requested a new trial and acquittal just days before their Friday sentencing.
Richardson acquitted them of a count of fraudulently obtaining state property; Casada on a count of soliciting and receiving bribes from programs receiving federal money and Cothren abetting him; and one count of Cothren offering and giving bribes and kickbacks and Casada abetting him, according to the report.
Attorneys for Casada and Cothren requested a mistrial during the four-week proceeding that stretched from mid-April into May after prosecutors inadvertently played an unredacted recording of an FBI interview with Casada that incriminated Cothren.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Parents, educators and anti-hunger advocates gathered at a community farm in Lakewood on Tuesday to launch a campaign in support of two Colorado ballot measures that would fully fund a voter-approved universal school meals program.
Propositions LL and MM would shore up funding for the Healthy School Meals For All program, which was created by Colorado voters in 2022 but has exceeded cost projections in its first years of operation. Referred to voters by the state Legislature, the two propositions are the only statewide measures that will appear on Coloradans’ ballots in the off-year election in November.
“We’re here today because we believe that children shouldn’t have to worry about the cost of lunch, or not having access to one because their family can’t afford afford to pay for it,” said Erika Cervantes, director of organizing and community partnerships for Hunger Free Colorado.

Colorado voters approved Proposition FF in 2022 to create the school meals program, which provides free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of family income. It was funded by limiting income tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 per year. The measure authorized the state to collect up to $100 million in new revenue through this reduced deduction.​ A 1992 constitutional amendment known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights​ requires tax hikes to be approved by voters.
The program’s funding mechanism raised more than expected in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, but its costs also exceeded projections, resulting in a budget gap that rose to roughly $50 million this year. Proposition LL would allow the state to keep $12 million in excess revenue that would otherwise be returned to voters under TABOR.
Proposition MM aims to permanently fund the full program by raising an additional $95 million annually for the program through further limits on tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 a year. Earners in that high-income category would pay an average of $486 more in income taxes yearly.










We’re here today because we believe that children shouldn't have to worry about the cost of lunch, or not having access to one because their family can't afford afford to pay for it.


– Erika Cervantes, director of organizing and community partnerships, Hunger Free Colorado


Enrollment in school meal programs grew by 30% or more in many school districts in the program’s first year of operation, exceeding expectations and leading to the budget shortfall. The gap has caused delays in implementing two supplementary programs that were also promised in Proposition FF — grants for purchasing locally grown food from Colorado farmers and increased wages for cafeteria workers — but advocates say the enrollment numbers underline the need for the program.
“We hear from our members around the state that the impact of Healthy School Meals For All has lived up to all the hopes and dreams we had for the program,” said Shannon Thompson, public policy and legislative chair for the Colorado School Nutrition Association. “No child has to face being stigmatized as poor when lining up for healthy meals. No child has to worry about whether or not there is money in their account as they approach each year. No child has to rush out the door in the morning hungry and not know where their next meal will be.”
Keep Kids Fed Colorado, an issue committee registered in support of Propositions LL and MM, has reported $150,000 in contributions, mostly from Hunger Free Colorado. The campaign touts a long list of endorsements from ogranizations including Children’s Hospital Colorado, Great Education Colorado, Mi Familia Vota, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and Save the Children Action Network.
In last month’s special legislative session, Colorado lawmakers passed a bill that tweaked Proposition MM, allowing the additional revenue to be spent on broader efforts to reduce food insecurity, once the Healthy School Meals For All program’s costs are covered. That would help the state partially offset the impact — estimated at up to $170 million annually — of reduced funding and higher administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a result of cuts passed by congressional Republicans this year.
“This summer, Congress slashed billions of dollars for programs that help families put food on the table,” said Jen Frankel, a parent who organizes a weekly food pantry for students and families at Denver South High School. “If voters do not turn out in November, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans, including children, older people and people with disabilities, will be in danger of going hungry.”

This story by Matthew Thomas was first published in The Bridge on Sept. 9, 2025.
After past programmatic moves that it acknowledged can disrupt student learning, The New School of Montpelier is setting down solid roots on the college green in Montpelier. 
With last year’s purchase of Bishop-Hatch Hall at 41 College Street and Alumnx Hall at 45 College Street from the Vermont College of Fine Arts, The New School can create “stable places” for students, according to Elias Gardener, the school’s executive director. 
Gardener noted that The New School’s students “often are diagnosed with autism or have experienced trauma and are extremely dependent on predictable consistency.” 
The New School of Montpelier, a worker co-operative, is a Vermont Therapeutic School approved by the State Board of Education, Gardener said, with its tuition set by the Vermont Agency of Education. The school was founded in 2005 for 16 children with “complex challenges in central Vermont foster care homes,” whose educational needs the local public schools could not meet. “All of our students receive special education services identified on Individual Education Programs and placed by public schools.” 
The school has occupied the lower floors of Bishop-Hatch Hall since 2009 and Almunx Hall since 2013, Gardener said. He added that currently there are three programs running on the college green. The purchase and renovation of these buildings will allow the school to expand enrollment, which is very much needed, he added, because the school has more referrals than it can accommodate at the moment. 
“Both are historic buildings,” Gardener said, noting that Bishop-Hatch was built in 1958 and Alumnx Hall in 1932 and that each had “significant deferred maintenance needs.”
The New School started its restoration with Bishop-Hatch Hall. The extensive project, reviewed by the Vermont Division of Historic Preservation includes stabilization maintenance, such as replacing the roof and the original steam heat system. In addition, there will be safety updates, such as removing asbestos and installing new ventilation and sprinkler systems. 
To increase student space, Gardener said the two lower floors are being renovated to make classrooms, which, upon completion, will allow The New School to add an additional program with the capacity to take up to ten more students. “We consistently have a multi-year waiting list with staffing and space being the two primary barriers to meeting the needs of the public schools,” he said. 
Gardener anticipates renovations to Bishop-Hatch Hall to be completed in March, 2026. 
The New School is planning a future fundraising campaign to restore Almunx Hall, which needs a new roof after having shingles sheared off in high winds and leaks in the cupola, he said, adding that the school hopes to make this repair in 2026. In addition, Gardener said the steam heating system needs to be replaced. The school also does not have the funding to restore the upper two floors of Bishop-Hatch Hall. “We are considering various options including conversion to housing, but for now they must be mothballed until they can be brought up to code,” said Gardener. 
“The New School is proud to be a steward of these historic buildings, particularly Alumnx Hall,” Gardner said. He added that it is important to the school to keep the hall open for community events and that the school uses the auditorium as a gymnasium and also a “vocational learning opportunity” for students involved in event set up and support, such as weddings. 
“There are so many exciting things the new owners of various buildings on the college green and Montpelier are doing,” Gardener said. “I love being a part of it.”

The seat opened up after Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) in June announced he would not run for re-election in 2026, and would instead make a bid for Commissioner of Public Lands. Boses is the only candidate in the race so far, according to Secretary of State records.
In an interview with Source NM, Boses, who also lives in Galisteo with her family, said she has been closely watching the state House Democrats for the last year and feels inspired by their leadership on protecting vulnerable families facing federal cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“Because of where we are politically at a national scale, I don’t want to sit at home and just assume that everything’s going to be OK,” Boses said. “I think there’s important work that’s been done and there’s a lot more to do.”
When the government works as intended, she noted, “it’s easy to go about our day-to-day lives and not be paying attention to things as closely. But I believe that democracy is under attack and being undermined, and so I can’t just sit back and hope that everything will be OK.” That’s not to say that she thinks being in the Legislature is “about fighting against Donald Trump…the work is about making life better for New Mexicans and doing the things that we can do as a state to protect democracy here.” As example, she praised the privacy protections lawmakers previously enacted for reproductive and gender-affirming health care providers and patients.
“We need to hold the line and make sure those things aren’t undermined,” she said.
Voters in 2023 re-elected Boses in a three-way race to a second term on the Santa Fe Public Schools Board of Education. Boses said she has not run for any other political office. Her school board term ends in December 2027; she intends to finish her term if she wins the legislative seat and takes office in January of that year.
Other key issues for Boses include education, housing, health care generally, economic development and climate resiliency, according to her campaign announcement.
A registered nurse who specializes in oncology, Boses said she isn’t working as a nurse presently “because of how challenging the health care system is and when decisions are made by people, whether those are executives in hospital systems or lawmakers who have never done that work.”
“Decisions are best made when people affected are at the table,” she said.
Boses said she worked as McQueen’s district legislative aide for nine months.
McQueen told Source NM on Tuesday it is a possibility that he will endorse her.
“I haven’t officially endorsed her but I think she would be great for the position,” McQueen said. “She’s a great person; she’s got great experience. I’m delighted that she’s running.”
Boses said the idea of running for the House came from a conversation she had with a friend over the summer about her experience watching floor debates and committee hearings.
“Are you discouraged or are you excited?” Boses recalls the friend asking her.
“I think I’m inspired,” she replied. “There’s a lot of folks who I can see are doing hard work. Maybe that’s something that I could bring my voice, experience and perspective to.”

(Photos by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch; logo via Iowa Board of Regents)State universities are once again asking for no increase in general university funding for the upcoming fiscal year, with the University of Iowa and Iowa State University staying the course they ran last year and the University of Northern Iowa falling in line with them after their requested raise was denied last legislative session.
If their requests are approved by the Iowa Board of Regents at its Sept. 18 meeting and honored by the state, the UI would receive nearly $223.5 million, ISU would receive more than $178.4 million and UNI would receive close to $101.9 million, totaling more than $503.8 million, all in general university funding for fiscal year 2027.
Both the UI and ISU requested flat general university funding for fiscal year 2026, which they received, but UNI requested $2.5 million in incremental funding to differentiate its tuition from more research-focused universities. UNI did not receive any additional funding.

According to the appropriations request report, the state’s public universities enrolled more than 70,000 students in total, more than 40% of whom came from outside of the state. The universities hand out a combined amount of around 13,000 bachelor degrees and 4,400 graduate and professional degrees each year.
“State funding for Regent higher education is a vital resource to attract students by keeping tuition affordable and allows the Regent universities to offer an extensive array of undergraduate, graduate and professional programs in support of Iowa workforce needs,” the report stated.
Funding increase requests aim at health care, agriculture ed
While universities requested no increases to general university dollars for the upcoming fiscal year, each institution asked for specific initiative funding that the report stated “represent a 1.5% increase in appropriations from the state general fund for each university.”
The University of Iowa is requesting $3.6 million to address the state’s shortage of rural physicians and train more doctors in rural medicine, according to the document. These dollars would go toward recruiting and retaining rural students studying medicine, developing a rural medicine track for medical students with “specialized curriculum and training” and form a statewide teaching network for expanded clinical training in rural areas.
Funds would also help support scholarships for students “dedicated to rural medicine” and grow the number of students graduating with advanced training in rural medicine. Currently five students each year leave the UI with this training, the document stated, and the university would like to increase that to 10 annually.
According to the report, 65 Iowa counties are categorized as “Health Professional Shortage Areas, and rural regions of the state house around 17% fewer doctors per capita than urban regions.
“The university’s rural physician program is proven to place physicians where they’re needed most, ensuring better health outcomes for underserved communities while reducing long-term healthcare costs,” the document stated.
Iowa State University is asking for a total of $3.6 million for a few different programs, some of which the university stated in the report it hopes to bring under the umbrella of its general university appropriations.
The Ames university proposed in the report that its Agriculture Experiment Station, Cooperative Extension Service and STEM workforce initiatives merge with the general university line item for appropriations requests and allocations, as they align with the university’s overall mission to provide “high-quality education, cutting-edge research and public service for Iowans.”
The bulk of requested funding for fiscal year 2027, to the tune of $3 million, would go to the Iowa Ag Tech Innovation Initiative, which the report states is “a strategic commitment to the future of Iowa farms, rural communities and statewide economy.”
ISU’s agricultural experiment station would receive $1.8 million of that funding to develop programming and support staff and faculty aimed at agricultural technology, like artificial intelligence, automation advanced sensing and more. The board document stated work from experts at ISU will result in improved practices and systems for increased efficiency and better data.
The report also included outcomes the university expects to come from the new focus on agricultural technology, including livestock production programs with improved efficiency and animal health and well-being and grain handling and processing programs that focus on safety, quality management and its uses in energy and livestock industries.
They would also target the corn and soybean industry with new systems that “emphasize system efficiency, integrated decision-making and linkages between agronomic machinery, inputs and harvest in key areas of crop productivity, nutrient-use efficiency, genetics, plant health and soil health,” according to the document.
ISU’s cooperative extension services would use $1.2 million of the requested funding to form new programs and expand existing outreach opportunities in order to bring “ag-tech innovations” to people across the state and teach on how they can be utilized to improve their work. Efforts would focus on nutrient and pest management, livestock management and AI workforce development in agriculture.
“Iowa remains a national leader in agricultural output, but continued long-term success depends on constantly improving the ability to innovate and adapt in the competitive global environment,” the report stated. “Iowa’s rural economy depends on agricultural research and innovation to maintain global competitiveness, but the full potential of innovation cannot be attained without education and adoption.”
ISU will also seek $600,000 for its veterinary diagnostic laboratory to supplement the $300,000 funding increase the state provided in fiscal year 2026 and provide additional support as the lab moves testing operations to a new facility that will increase annual operational expenses for the lab by around $3 million.
The University of Northern Iowa is seeking funding to expand recently launched programs, namely its nursing degree and neighboring state tuition initiative.
Launched in fall 2024 with a cohort of 24 students, UNI requested in the board document $600,000 for its baccalaureate degree in nursing in order to expand the program. Funding would go toward hiring additional faculty and staff and equipment purchases for students.
UNI is also asking for $1 million for its neighboring state tuition program, which was previously set to receive state funding last year before Gov. Kim Reynolds line-item vetoed the $1.5 million allocation due to an expectation of ongoing funding and questions about its impact on current students.
The Cedar Falls university launched the program with funding from its foundation in July, allowing students coming from Iowa’s six bordering states to pay in-state tuition starting in the 2025-2026 school year.
“Over 40% of UNI graduates from the states contiguous to Iowa stay in the state after graduation, joining Iowa’s workforce and adding value to Iowa’s economic development,” the document stated. “Not only will this funding open access to programs for students from the states contiguous to Iowa, but it will also increase enrollment of undergraduates ready to join the Iowa workforce upon graduation.”

File Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderA federal judge has rejected a challenge to absentee ballot restrictions implemented under a controversial measure passed in 2021, delivering a blow to one of the last ongoing lawsuits against the sweeping election law.
The law, passed as Senate Bill 202, included new provisions that prevented voter registration organizations from distributing pre-filled absentee ballot applications to voters or blank applications to any resident who had already requested an absentee ballot — as happened in 2020. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit argued that the restrictions infringed upon their First Amendment rights.
In a 50-page decision issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge J. P. Boulee upheld the law’s absentee ballot application provisions, ruling that the use of pre-filled absentee ballot applications increased confusion among voters and that the secretary of state’s office had demonstrated “interrelated compelling governmental interests” in curtailing their use.
“The prefilled absentee-ballot applications sparked confusion and concern about voter fraud, especially when the prefilled information was incorrect,” he wrote in his decision. “Voters complained or were confused about duplicate applications as well.”
The Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information, two nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations which sent out approximately 9.6 million absentee ballot request forms in Georgia ahead of the 2020 election and helped bring the lawsuit against the law, condemned the decision. Georgia had 7.6 million registered voters in 2020, according to government data.
“These provisions block important work that has proven time and time again to help the voters of Georgia,” said Tom Lopach, who serves as president and CEO of both organizations. “In the context of increasing government overreach into our elections, the Court’s decision to limit advocacy at the expense of the right to free speech is deeply concerning. We will continue to fight to protect programs that we know help eligible Georgia voters.”
The groups added that they are “reviewing the ruling and assessing our legal options.”

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who has repeatedly defended SB 202 over the course of his two terms, applauded Boulee’s ruling.
“SB 202 is about common sense: Protecting voters from confusion, making sure every vote counts once, and keeping our elections free, fair, and secure,” Raffensperger said in a statement. “The fact that the law keeps winning in court shows that Georgia is leading the way for election integrity.”
Defenders of the 2021 law also celebrated a victory earlier this year, when U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi dismissed a Biden-era Department of Justice lawsuit alleging that the sweeping election overhaul violates the federal Voting Rights Act aimed at protecting minority voters from disenfranchisement.
But other challenges to the omnibus election law, which also imposed new ID requirements on absentee voters, limited the use of ballot drop boxes, permitted mass voter eligibility challenges and — perhaps most controversially — banned distribution of food and water to voters waiting in line, are still working their way through the courts. In August, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments over the food and water provision, which Boulee blocked in 2023. A decision in that case has yet to be released.
The bill was passed during the legislative session following the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden narrowly defeated President Donald Trump in Georgia and Democrats flipped the state’s two U.S. Senate seats. Over 1.3 million Georgians cast absentee ballots in the 2020 election, which was held during the Covid-19 pandemic.

(Provided/Department of Natural Resources)After 205 years, Poinsett Bridge in South Carolina’s Upstate is getting a facelift.
The historic bridge, once part of a state road extending from Charleston to North Carolina, will close between Sept. 29 and March 31 as preservationists repair its lime mortar, replace missing stones and install a guardrail, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.
The entire 400-acre preserve surrounding the gothic-style bridge, located in Greenville County, will close during that six months to give crews space to work, the department said in a news release.
Built in 1820, the bridge was one of three included in an 11-mile segment of road running through the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Saluda Mountain Road, as it was known, was part of an ambitious state plan to bolster commerce coming into the state from the Charleston port, according to a department history of the area.
Two of the three bridges now lie beneath the Saluda Reservoir. Only Poinsett Bridge remains standing, making it the oldest surviving bridge in South Carolina, if not the entire Southeast, according to a report on the bridge’s history.
Preservation work
All that time has taken its toll, said Meg Gaillard, an archaeologist for the conservation arm of the natural resource agency. Erosion over the years allowed water to seep through the arch, “making it vulnerable to possible structural failure,” Gaillard said in an email.
Engineers and archaeologists have been eyeing the bridge for repairs since 2021, Gaillard said.
“This work is designed to ensure people will enjoy the bridge for many years to come,” she said.
When visitors return to the preserve April 1, the bridge will look a little different. Archaeologists must clean and replace the mortar in the joints of the bridge, so the whole structure will appear newer, Gaillard said.
Since the preservation work is meant to last at least another 200 years, moss and lichen that live on the bridge’s surface will have plenty of time to regrow, softening the stone and giving it that old look, she said.
History
A keystone set in the Poinsett Bridge reads, “1820,” the year of its completion.
Two years before starting construction, legislators spent $1 million — the equivalent of $25 million in today’s dollars — on a four-year economic development effort to bolster trade between Charleston’s port and the Upstate. They put the newly established Board of Public Works in charge of the initiative, which centered around building a road running from the mountains to the coastline, according to the historical report.
The bridge is named for Joel Poinsett, a former legislator and the first director of the new board who is famous for introducing the poinsettia flower to the country.
The origins of the bridge’s design, however, are more of an unknown.
No written schematics for the bridge or the road remain, making it impossible to determine for certain who made the plans.
It is the prolific American architect Robert Mills, best known for designing the Washington Monument, who often receives the credit for drawing up the bridge’s design.
Mills became the lead architect for the Board of Public Works a month after the road’s completion, according to the state’s natural resources agency.
The 19th Century architect’s distinctive combination of Palladian, Georgian and Greek Revival styles remain on view across South Carolina, including at the Robert Mills House in Columbia and the Fireproof Building in Charleston.
The question remains, though, whether the Poinsett Bridge should count among those. Some historians point to illustrations Mills made of all three bridges on the Upstate portion of the road as an indication that he was the brain behind it.
Disrepair
For 135 years, people traveled the road between the Upstate, Midlands and Lowcountry. Traffic along the road dipped over time with the development of a railroad system, the surge in popularity of cars that replaced horse-drawn buggies, and the creation of more convenient routes. Still, some affluent families continued to use the road as the most direct way out of the Lowcountry, where malaria was common during summer months, to second homes in the mountains.
The nail in the coffin for the bridge as a traveling path came in 1955, when Greenville County rerouted the road, according to the natural resources department.
For years, the bridge stood unused on private property. The construction of a nearby Boy Scout camp in the 1920s, however, brought it back into the public eye, according to the report on the bridge’s history.
Fifty years later it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, according to an application submitted at the time.
Then, in the early 2000s, the South Carolina Heritage Trust, a division of the Department of Natural Resources, stepped in. The state agency bought the bridge, along with about 120 acres, in 2003 to create a nature preserve.
Last year, the department added another 280 acres to the preserve, nearly tripling its size. Along with the bridge itself, the property is home to several rare plant species, migrating songbirds and five species of bats, according to the natural resources department.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bridge-angle-left.jpg,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

(Photo by Jarvis DeBerry | Louisiana Illuminator)The number of people killed on Louisiana roads in 2024 reached its lowest level in five years, with fatality numbers dropping faster than the rest of the country, the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission announced Tuesday. 
Motor vehicle crashes in Louisiana caused 753 deaths last year, a 7.2% reduction from 2023 and a bigger decline than the national rate of 3.8%, according to data from the Center for Analytics and Research in Transportation Safety.  
Helmut Schneider, the center’s executive director, shared the new statistics in a presentation at Louisiana State University. 
Lisa Freeman, executive director of the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission, said the lower fatality rate “shows we are moving in the right direction, but we still have work to do.”
“We will not be satisfied until our rate reaches zero,” she said.
The statistics showed 88% of vehicle occupants use a seatbelt in Louisiana and a 18.3% decrease in DWI-related deaths.
While DWI deaths went down, DWI arrests increased 4.3%, to 13,675 people in 2024. The spike is “likely due to an increase in enforcement” rather than an increase in the number of drunk drivers, Schneider said.
The statistics also show an all-time low for people killed in motorcycle crashes in Louisiana, with 69 deaths. It represents a 28.9% decrease from 2023. 
However, the numbers also showed an increase in bicycle-related and pedestrian deaths, with 44 cyclists killed compared with 35 in 2023 and 161 pedestrians killed compared to 147 in 2023.

(Photo by Commonwealth Media Services)Pennsylvania corrections officers may soon be able to live outside of the state.
On Tuesday, the state Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously advanced Senate Bill 111, which would authorize the hiring and promotion of out-of-state residents as COs by the Department of Corrections.
“There are few jobs… (as) stressful as a corrections officer, working day and night, weekends, holidays, to protect all of us, as well as the inmates and their colleagues,” said Sen. David Argall (R-Schuylkill), who authored the proposal.
Argall said he believes eliminating the residency requirement would address staffing shortages. He said the shortages have resulted in more challenges for corrections officers, including mandatory overtime, increased stress, and violence.
State Department of Corrections (DOC) Sec. Laurel R. Harry announced in February that the vacancy rate for corrections officers was 4.8% by the end of January. She credited targeted recruitment efforts as a result in the vacancy rate dropping from 10.5% in late 2022.
There are 23 state prisons in Pennsylvania, including two in Argall’s district, Frackville and Mahanoy. They are both in Schuylkill County.
He said he met with the leadership of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA), who support the proposal.
“And since many of our corrections facilities are located close to the border, we believe that this would provide immediate relief,” Argall said.
Rep. Clint Owlett (R-Tioga) authored House Bill 1968 in the previous session, which also aimed to eliminate the residency requirement for corrections officers. In his co-sponsorship memo, he noted that SCI Somerset, SCI Chester, SCI Waymart and SCI Phoenix are close to bordering states.
Argall’s proposal will now advance to the full Senate for consideration.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/prison-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

The prohibition on cattle imports due to the New World screwworm is hitting New Mexico ports hard, according to Border Authority officials. (Photo courtesy of Daniel Manzanares)Even though about one-third of all cattle the United States imports from Mexico come through New Mexico ports of entry, investments and planning about how to stop an ongoing screwworm outbreak are happening outside of the state.
That’s according to officials with the New Mexico Border Authority, who provided an interim legislative committee Tuesday afternoon with an update on the New World screwworm infestation. Concerns about the outbreak prompted the U.S. Department of Agriculture in July to halt cattle imports from Mexico.
The prohibition on cattle imports meant a halt to a $1.3 billion industry, according to authority officials, and is hitting the Columbus, N.M. port of entry particularly hard. Mexican cattle growers ship approximately 300,000 cattle through Columbus and Santa Teresa ports of entry each year, according to the authority.
Authorities see no immediate end in sight for the outbreak, according to Gerardo Fierro, the authority’s director, and Joseph de la Rosa, the authority’s board’s chair. The onus falls on Mexican animal welfare authorities to slow northward advancement of the infestation, Fierro said, to the USDA’s satisfaction. 
The movement of the parasitic fly, previously eradicated from the U.S. for the last several decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona and Texas in the last several months. The screwworm’s name references the maggot’s behavior of burrowing into the flesh of a living animal, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage to livestock, wildlife and pets. 
Santa Teresa cattle border crossing reopening scrapped after screwworm movement in Mexico

In late August, the USDA awarded $750 million to a lab in Edinburg, Texas, to produce about 300 million sterile screwworm flies per week. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins stood alongside Texas Gov. Greg Abbott at a news conference, at which she said that the infestation “endangers our livestock industry and it threatens the stability of beef prices for consumers across America,” according to the Texas Tribune.
De la Rosa pointed to the new facility being built in Texas as an example of a missed opportunity for New Mexico. He said it’s another example of why the New Mexico Legislature needs to increase its funding for New Mexico border infrastructure.
“New Mexico was not even part of the conversation for that; we have the largest cattle crossing along the US-Mexico border; the cattle industry is important here,” he said. “But because of our lack of infrastructure and our lack of development along the border, we weren’t even, you know, in that conversation.”
The authority, which seeks to spur development at the state’s four international ports of entry, currently has a flat operating budget of about $577,000, de la Rosa said, though he and Fierro listed some multi-million-dollar capital projects they’re hoping the Legislature will fund. 
Between 2023 and 2024, the total value of all goods imported or exported across the Columbus and Santa Teresa ports of entry grew from about $28.3 billion to about $40.4 billion, according to Fierro’s presentation. The vast majority of that occurred at Santa Teresa, according to Fierro.
Even with the decrease in cattle imports, which Fierro said he’s still trying to quantify, the ports are still among the fastest-growing in the country and competitive with ports in El Paso.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cattle-Export-lots-1024x441.jpg,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

(Photo: Getty Images)The North Carolina Charter School Review Board on Tuesday reviewed a new law that expands its authority while giving charter schools more flexibility in daily operations. 
The law, which took effect in July after the Republican-led General Assembly overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, changes the way charter schools are overseen and run.
In his veto message, Stein called Senate Bill 254 “an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction.” Stein also argued the measure “weakens accountability of charter schools when every North Carolina student deserves excellent public schools, whether traditional or charter.” 
Some of the more significant changes in the law include granting the review board authority to propose, recommend and approve rules and policies for charter schools. Previously, the State Board of Education was responsible for creating the rules.
The law also gives charter schools more operational flexibility and clarifies accountability measures for low-performing schools.
Here’s what changes under the law: 

The review board now approves rules, policies and charter agreements, authority previously held by the State Board of Education. 


Schools may move within 10 miles of their current site, as long as they remain in the same district, without prior approval. Moving beyond 10 miles or across districts require the board’s approval.


Schools can develop their own evaluation systems, as long as they align with state teaching standards.


Schools are no longer required to list class rank on student transcripts. Some board members welcomed the change, noting that rank often pressures students into course choices aimed at boosting their standing.
 Remote academies with 250 or more students can apply for a separate charter under an expedited process, and they will receive their own school performance grade

According to Sander[...]","Arkansas National Guardsmen and central Arkansas law enforcement officers completed required training on Aug. 2, 2025 at Burns Park. (Courtesy of the Arkansas National Guard)Up to 40 Arkansas National Guard members will assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in apprehending migrants at risk of deportation under the federal Title 32 program, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Tuesday.
The federally-funded initiative will enlist up to 27 Air National Guard Airmen and 13 Army National Guard soldiers. According to Sanders’ news release, 18 guardsmen will be assigned in Little Rock, 10 in Fort Smith, 10 in Fayetteville and two at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock.
Guardsmen will not be armed and will instead help ICE agents transport, process and detain individuals lacking permanent legal status, the release states.
The Guardsmen involved in the initiative have Title 32 status, meaning they are federally funded but serve under the command of the governor of their state or territory.
“Violent, criminal illegal immigrants have no place in Arkansas,” Sanders said in Tuesday’s news release. “…I look forward to our guardsmen working with the Trump Administration to enforce federal immigration law.”
Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas’ adjutant general, expressed support for the initiative in the news release, saying the National Guard is “highly trained and committed to enabling federal agents to focus on their core operations.”
American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Dickson called the initiative “an abuse of power that jeopardizes Arkansans’ rights and safety” in a news release from the organization.
“Through this manufactured emergency, Governor Sanders is not making Arkansas safer — she is stoking fear, scapegoating immigrants, inviting racial profiling and undermining the rule of law,” Dickson said. “Immigrant families are part of our communities, our congregations, our schools and our workplaces. Treating them as enemies to be rounded up and detained is un-American and unacceptable.”
US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower court’s ban on ICE agents’ racial profiling of Latinos in Southern California. The region has seen protests in recent months over ICE’s actions in response to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented migrants.
Sanders sent 80 National Guardsmen to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas in 2023 and sent 40 the following year, both times with the goal of assisting federal immigration authorities. Other Republican governors have made similar efforts.
This year, Sanders signed the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. The law established harsher penalties for migrants who commit violent felonies in the state, and it required Arkansas law enforcement agencies to participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, which deputizes them to help apprehend and deport migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
In August, the Arkansas National Guard formally requested authority to make immigration arrests under the “task force model” of the 287(g) program. National Guard soldiers typically do not serve a law enforcement role.
The task force model is one of three 287(g) programs offered by ICE to local law enforcement agencies that impart limited degrees of immigration enforcement powers. The first, the warrant service officer model, allows trained law enforcement agencies to serve immigration warrants to those already in local jails. The jail enforcement model allows local law enforcement to identify and process those it believes are in the country illegally that are brought into the jail.

Vermont’s Department of Health confirmed the state’s first-known human case of the mosquito-borne Jamestown Canyon virus. The disease has relatively mild symptoms, especially for young people who do not have underlying health conditions.
The state began monitoring mosquitoes for Jamestown Canyon Virus this year, after it was found in nearby states. The monitoring showed insects in Rutland, Marshfield and Whitingham all carried the disease. This human case, which was confirmed in a Sept. 8 lab test in a Windsor County patient, further confirms the presence of the virus in Vermont, according to Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian.
“It is a good indicator and reminder, just like anytime we find the virus in mosquitoes, to continue to take precautions against mosquito bites,” Kwit said.
Mosquitoes become infected when they bite animals — particularly deer — carrying the virus. They then spread it to other animals and people when they bite them. Humans are “dead end hosts,” meaning that the viral load people receive from an infected mosquito bite is too low to spread to other people.
It also means that many people with the virus never experience symptoms, while others can develop flu-like symptoms, such as fevers, headaches, chills and aches. People with compromised immune systems and older people are more at risk for more severe symptoms — for some, more serious disease could escalate to confusion and discoordination, stiffness and seizure. About half of people who do become symptomatic get hospitalized, according to the Department of Health. 
The best way to prevent infection is to prevent mosquito bites in the first place. The Department of Health recommends limiting time outside during dusk and dawn when the insects are most active, wearing long sleeves and insect repellent, and covering windows, doors, playpens and strollers with tight mosquito nets or screens. The department also advises people to clear any standing water that may accumulate in things like pots, buckets or children’s outdoor toys.
In late summer, the risk for mosquito-borne illnesses increases, Kwit said, since there has been more time for the virus to circulate in hosts and mosquitoes. The risk remains — and the state plans to continue monitoring mosquitoes — until the first fall frost. 
The state also tests the collected mosquito samples for West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis — or EEE — virus, as it has in years past. There have been no confirmed cases of either in a human this year.
“We’re just learning about this virus, too,” Kwit said of Jamestown Canyon virus. “We’ve only just started actively testing for it in mosquitoes we collect in Vermont, so over time, we’ll get an understanding of where we’re finding it, as we’re gathering more evidence.”

Free.,US Supreme Court sets Trump tariffs case arguments for November,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-sets-trump-tariffs-case-arguments-november,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in early November on whether President Donald Trump’s emergency tariffs are legal, according to an order the court released Tuesday.The one-page unsigned order laid out an expedited timeline, which the administration had requested, for the consolidated legal challenges brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general.A U.S. appeals court sided with the businesses and state officials late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court’s ruling in May finding Trump’s unprecedented use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to trigger global tariffs violated the Constitution.The justices’ acceptance of the case is the latest in a string of legal challenges against the administration that have escalated to the high court since Trump took office in January. Recently the Supreme Court has handed the administration wins on immigration enforcement and withholding foreign aid.Trump began imposing wide-reaching tariffs in February and significantly broadened them in the following months on goods from around the globe after declaring national emergencies — first over illegal fentanyl smuggling, and then declaring trade deficits an emergency. A trade deficit means the U.S. imports more goods from a country than that nation’s businesses purchase from U.S. suppliers.As of July, the U.S. had collected roughly $122 billion in tariff revenue, according to a monthly tracker produced by the Peterson Institute on International Economics. Tariffs are taxes that the U.S. government collects from domestic businesses and purchasers when they import foreign goods.In the administration’s appeal to the Supreme Court to fast-track the case, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued the government would face “catastrophic” economic fallout if it had to repay businesses for the tariffs already collected, particularly if the court waited until next year to take the case.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states that challenged Trump’s emergency tariffs. The business plaintiffs include V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.",,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

Last month, the state phased out a system, started during Covid-19, that provided rides for people leaving prison. It’s only the latest change to a beleaguered judicial transport system.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
MONTPELIER — In the span of five years, the intricate web of sheriff’s deputies, prison staff and judges that orchestrated the transport of people to and from court hearings has upended.
“The whole infrastructure of our transport system that existed for 100 years doesn’t exist anymore,” Matt Valerio, Vermont’s defender general, told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
The Joint Legislative Justice Oversight Committee, composed of Vermont legislative committee leaders and other lawmakers, were discussing the nagging issue, which returned to the spotlight in late August. At that time, the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs decided to stop transporting people released from the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, phasing out entirely a practice that had been cut due to a lack of resources. 
Instead, people would leave the rural prison on foot, left to find their way.
While issues like rising crime and criminal justice reform tend to attract more legislative and media attention, the bureaucratic underpinnings of the legal and carceral systems, like prisoner transports, have a quieter but daily impact on those navigating them. Spurred by Covid-19 practices and fewer transport resources, the state has increasingly relied on virtual court hearings as a solution. Valerio and others have decried that switch as jeopardizing the rights of criminal defendants.

Post-release transports — the type the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs began during Covid and ended last month — make up a small fraction of the work conducted by state-paid transport deputies, according to Tim Lueders-Dumont, the department’s executive director. 
Scarcely more than 200 of the 4,000 rides these deputies provided last year were for people leaving prison, he told lawmakers on Tuesday. But cutting the rides reveals the fraying and overburdened system. 
Before the pandemic, the Vermont Department of Corrections provided occasional post-release transports. And when sheriffs had more resources, their overall volume of rides was far larger. According to Lueders-Dumont, the hours that county-paid deputies, rather than state-paid, have spent providing judicial transports has dropped from about 20,000 to 3,000, while the state-paid level has remained consistent at about 20,000 hours annually. 
“We are feeling so pinched,” he said.

So thin is the department’s staffing, Lueders-Dumont said, that he’s had to sometimes push back at judges’ transport orders, asking them to reconsider the need. He joked that he’s so far avoided being held in contempt of court — but only narrowly. 
When people are released from Vermont’s rural prisons onto the streets, they will do what they need to do to survive, Valerio told lawmakers. In rare past instances, that’s meant starting fires to stay warm, he said. 
To fix the decayed transport system, Valerio urged lawmakers to increase funding for both more sheriff’s transport deputies and for Department of Corrections transport staff. At the same time, he recommended restricting the use of remote arraignments — the first hearings in a criminal case — so that when people are released, they’re in their home county rather than a prison in another part of the state. 
But money may be hard to come by. Last year, Lueders-Dumont asked the Legislature to fund six new transport staff. Instead, he received only an extra unfunded position. And this year, the House’s budget writers are warning their peers it will be a penny-pinching session, driven by federal cuts.

Some of those detained, including Kilmar Abrego Garica, of Maryland, whose mistaken deportation captured national attention, detailed psychological and physical torture. No protection from tortureThe document was obtained through a lawsuit by Democracy Forward, which specifically argued the financial agreement between El Salvador and the U.S. “was created without any legal basis.” “The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”  That case is being overseen by District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg, who also ordered the Trump administration to turn around planes carrying men removed under the wartime law. Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador.",,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

Kevin Stitt’s removal of homeless camps in Tulsa will be an ongoing process and could expand to other areas of the state, an Oklahoma Highway Patrol official said Tuesday.
As of mid-Monday, the Highway Patrol had helped remove about 30 encampments and about a dozen more had been identified, said Lt. Mark Southall. One particular camp was a mile long, he said.
Some of the camps have been around for years, Southall said.
“Once we get these camps that are by the roadways on state property cleaned up, we’re going to have to continue to go back and check on these camps and make sure there’s not people living in them,” he said.
Late last week, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he had launched Swift Action for Families Everywhere, or “Operation SAFE,” in an effort to end homelessness in Tulsa by dismantling camps on state property. Stitt’s campaign was launched without consulting Tulsa’s mayor. 
Initially, OHP issued warnings to homeless individuals. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation posted notices at encampments on state property telling individuals to vacate the area.
On Friday, OHP and other state agencies began clearing out the encampments. They offered homeless individuals a ride to a treatment or housing facility or a trip to jail if they refused.
As of Tuesday, Southall said troopers encountered hundreds of homeless individuals. About 600,000 pounds of trash and debris have been removed from encampments, he said.
The operation has involved between 20 and 25 troopers, he said.
Troopers approached the operation with compassion for those involved, Southall said.
“Knowing these people have lived in some of these camps for over 10 years and that moving was going to be hard for them – we had no problems,” he said. “Almost everybody that we dealt with was cooperative to the point we didn’t have to make any arrests.”
One person accepted an offer for services, said Sarah Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.
Stewart said one person’s dog had been shot after lunging at an officer. The dog was taken for treatment.
Southall said the dog later died.
The camps have become a public safety issue, Southall said. 
Some homeless people are involved in automobile-pedetrian collisions, he said.
“It’s sad enough they are homeless,” Southall said. “It’s even worse if they get hit by a car and die.”
In addition, homeless people build unsafe fires and have discarded bodily fluids near public waterways, he said.
Troopers have also found stolen property within the camps, Southall said.
“Our goal is to continue to check on these camps as time goes on to where people know you just can’t camp on state property or they are going to come move you away,” Southall said.
Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols on Monday said Stitt did not give notice or coordinate with local officials.
“This is somewhat of a manufactured crisis by doing it without coordination with the city,” Nichols said. “And so my great hope is that it doesn’t last long going down the road.”
Nichols said Stitt was aware that the city’s homeless shelters were over 100% capacity. 
He said the operation is having a negative impact on public safety. In addition, it has undermined the relationships local law enforcement and others have cultivated with the homeless population, he said.
Nichols said the city has been working to reduce homelessness and provide affordable housing.
“Progress sometimes is not as fast as some people would like it to be, but progress does not look like a bunch of Instagram and Twitter videos that, frankly, tell not even half of the story,” Nichols said.
Nichols was referring to Stitt’s use of social media showing the removal of debris and items left behind.

(Submitted)TOPEKA — A southeast Kansas farmer, veterinarian and veteran is running for Congress because he is “increasingly alarmed at the direction this administration is heading.”
Don Coover, a Democrat and political newcomer, is challenging Republican Derek Schmidt, who currently holds the 2nd District seat. Coover wants to see a more inclusive, solutions-oriented government and country, he said.
“I think we, as a country, are becoming more and more authoritarian, less and less tolerant of each other, and less willing to seek solutions to problems we all see through slightly different lenses,” he said.
The focus of his campaign largely revolves around the pocketbook. Tariffs are harming the agriculture industry, Coover said. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is piling on trillions to the national debt, he said, “and if we don’t do anything about it, people like my granddaughter are going to be left to clean up the mess.”
He said he is also concerned about the availability and sustainability of rural hospitals.
“If you get your arm torn off in a hay baler or your kid spikes a high fever, you shouldn’t have to drive four hours to get to an ER,” Coover said. “We’ve got to get our health care system working for people, not insurance companies.”
Coover is a West Point graduate, and he later earned a degree from Kansas State University’s veterinary medicine school. In between, he was a U.S. Army military intelligence pilot in Korea.
Coover helps run the family business, raising Wagyu beef on a southeast Kansas ranch “built on science, legacy, and the belief that truly great beef begins long before the plate,” the company’s website says. He also owns a Galesburg-based company offering routine veterinary and health management services for cattle, along with cattle embryo transfer and in vitro fertilization.
Coover lives on a ranch in Galesburg with his wife. He has two stepchildren and a granddaughter. His campaign office is headquartered in Pittsburg, according to federal campaign filing records.
“Any sane person can see how broken politics is these days. When something is broken, something has to be done to fix it,” Coover said. “I’ve always been one of the guys who would do the jobs that had to get done, but no one else wanted to do. We need less career politicians making decisions in Washington and more folks who are used to putting in a hard day of work.”
Kansas’ 2nd District stretches from the state’s southeast border to its northeast corner, meandering around Johnson, Miami, Franklin and Anderson counties, through parts of Douglas and Wyandotte counties and as far west as Marion County. Schmidt won the district in 2024, defeating Democrat Nancy Boyda by more than 57,000 votes. Kansas has one Democratic congressional delegate, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of the state’s 3rd District. Each of the state’s U.S. House seats and one U.S. Senate seat are up for reelection in 2026.
Coover filed paperwork to run for Congress on Aug. 25. He is beginning his campaign while his opponent has a more than $260,000 lead, according to campaign records. Coover said he is focused on getting his message out to people across his district and doing “the right things for Kansans and our country.”
“Compare that to Rep. Schmidt, who’s been running for and been in elected office for the past 25 years. He’s part of the career politicians who are more focused on doing what their party leaders want them to do,” Coover said. “I think people are ready for new voices.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Don-Coover-headshot-scaled-e1757454292948-1024x577.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement

New Mexico’s Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, condemned the ruling in Spanish and English from the House floor Monday, saying it “condemns millions of Latinos to live in fear” of being detained.
“This is the racism that goes hand in hand with facism,” Leger Fernandez said in Spanish.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez called the decision a “grave insult to the people of New Mexico” in a statement released Tuesday.
“Our state has the highest proportion  of Latinos in the nation  — many of them, like me, American citizens whose families have lived in New Mexico for generations,” Torrez said. “This unconscionable decision, which ignores our Constitutional rights, makes us second-class citizens in our own country.”

Torrez said the New Mexico Constitution protects people from “racial profiling by state, county and municipal law enforcement,” and that New Mexico law enforcement is required to follow the state law. He urged anyone who believes they were racially profiled to contact the New Mexico Department of Justice.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in a statement that he will “fight like hell,” to protect New Mexico freedoms.
“President Trump, Congressional Republicans, and now the radical majority of the Supreme Court believe it’s okay to stop and detain anyone – including Americans – because of how they look, speak, or where they are. This is morally wrong and un-American,” Heinrich said. “Nowhere in the United States of America should anyone be detained for the way they look or how they speak. It doesn’t matter what job they work or where they are in their hometown.”

Simmons, in a decision from the bench, concluded there wasn’t sufficient evidence to prove that the 15 individuals, charged with a host of forgery and conspiracy crimes, had criminal intent when they allegedly signed documents certifying Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump. 
That led Simmons to dismiss the charges and she did not order the cadre to be bound over for trial.
During the course of the case, Simmons heard one of several preliminary examinations for the group in April 2024. It was then that Leonard and his wife, Jenell Leonard, who owns the Lansing-based Marketing Resource Group, were said to be among those whom Special Investigator Howard Shock identified as unindicted co-conspirators in the case. The list of unindicted co-conspirators included former Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox and Republican strategist Stu Sandler.
Shock also confirmed President Donald Trump, as well as Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani; former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; Chris Velasco, who worked with Trump’s campaign in Michigan; and Kenneth Chesebro, who pleaded guilty in Georgia for helping to organize the fake electors plot across seven states including Michigan, were among the list of unindicted co-conspirators 
As Simmons dismissed the charges Tuesday, Leonard issued a statement slamming Nessel for pursuing the case. 
“Today, justice finally prevailed. This confirms what Jenell and I have maintained from the very beginning; this case was without merit, politically motivated, and driven not by justice, but by an attorney general intent on scoring political points,” Leonard wrote.“The judge’s dismissal is a complete vindication, and I am grateful that our names, along with President Trump, have been cleared.”

He accused Nessel of repeatedly abusing her station, calling her “the most reckless attorney general in the country,” and asked for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate her office.
Nessel’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Leonard’s call for a federal investigation.
The attorney general has been a frequent critic of Trump’s, and has pursued several cases tied to his false claim that he won the 2020 election, and his assertion that the election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence to support that claim. 
The attorney general has also received criticism from Republicans for the more than 30 cases she has led or joined challenging the Trump administration over a host of federal actions from the president, including an attempt to pause federal funding to state governments. 
Other GOP governor hopefuls weigh in
Leonard wasn’t the only Republican gubernatorial candidate to weigh in on the decision.
Former Attorney General Mike Cox called the case “another example of lawfare and the Fake-News media trying to destroy anyone that doesn’t agree with their opinions.”
“Good on Judge Simmons to stand up to the Democrat machine and demand due process,” Cox said in a post on social media.
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt shared an image of a fake book that TV host Jimmy Kimmel joked about ghost-writing for the president during his 2016 campaign.
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) took his criticism further, accusing Michigan Democrats of eroding the judicial system and imperiling the republic.
“While Michigan’s affordability and education decline, they waste taxpayer funds for political vendettas, James said in a post on social media. “As governor, I will expose their misconduct and restore blind justice to our state.” 
Nessel, however, raised similar concerns about Trump and his supporters during a virtual news conference held after the decision. 
“For many when it is this President and this President’s followers, then there is no criminal activity, no action nefarious enough to warrant consequences of any kind, especially when it comes to rigging the system in Trump’s favor,” Nessel said. “We see it in the courts in real time today, as judges in Michigan and across the nation hem and haw over these election related cases, and it’s getting harder and harder to even get an election case across the finish line, let alone to get them in a timely decision where perhaps it would have made a difference.” 
The attorney general raised further concerns about judges facing threats and fear of retaliation when handling cases related to the president.
Nessel also remained steadfast in her decision to bring charges against the 15 defendants.
“When I complete my time in this office, I will forever believe that issuing these charges and filing these cases was the righteous, proper, appropriate and legally compelled thing to do by my role as state attorney general, and I feel certain that history will vindicate that decision,” Nessel said.

The vote, which was unanimous, comes after a hearing the PSC held in New Albany last week over Holly Springs’ long troubled power provider. At the hearing, the commission made two decisions: to declare that the city had “failed to provide reasonably adequate service,” violating state law, and to petition a chancery judge to place the utility into a receivership.
Holly Springs’ utility department serves about 12,000 customers in north Mississippi, most of whom live outside the city limits.

Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown, whose constituency includes Holly Springs, explained the PSC has discretion over how often and how long to impose the fines, as well as how often the city has to pay what’s owed. For instance, Brown said, if the utility does end up in a third party’s hands or being bought, the PSC can end the fines.
Money from the fines, he added, would go to the state’s general fund. Brown said the PSC could then request the Legislature to appropriate those dollars back to whoever is running the utility. 
“This problem has been decades in the making,” he said during Tuesday’s monthly docket meeting. 
Brown also noted allegations that Holly Springs has misappropriated funds meant to be reinvested into the utility. Those claims are at the center of a lawsuit the Tennessee Valley Authority, which sells power to the city, filed against Holly Springs earlier this year. 
Central District Public Service Commissioner De’Keither Stamps asked his colleagues where the money for fines would come from, before concluding they’d likely have to come from Holly Springs taxpayers. Stamps also said the city took steps Monday to address recommendations made by Silverpoint Consulting in a July report.
“Does that not signal to this body that the entity is making appropriate steps to improve the system?” Stamps asked.

Brown responded that the city has had plenty of chances already, and that the fines are meant to motivate local leaders. 
“The people in that district have obviously been suffering under a system that has failed them for decades,” he said. “Although we appreciate their moving to rectify this, that’s exactly why this penalty is being levied, to make sure they understand not providing adequate service is not going to be tolerated by this body.”
Mississippi Today reached out to Holly Springs’ mayor and city attorney and did not hear back before publication. 
Fines from the PSC would just add onto recent financial challenges for the small city of just around 7,000 people. In August, Mississippi Today reported that the state auditor’s office diverted $450,000 of Holly Springs’ sales tax revenue — or roughly half of the city’s yearly total — for past-due audits.
The city’s median income is around $47,000 and its poverty rate is about one in four, census data shows. Both figures are worse than the rest of the state’s.
Talking to Mississippi Today after the meeting, Brown said while he understands the city may have trouble paying the fines, the idea is to compel action from local leaders such as selling off parts of or all of its service area to a neighboring electric cooperative.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185719/3X0A1847-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644
,DC,2025-09-09 21:37:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,RFK Jr. lists 100+ recommendations to ‘Make America Healthy Again’,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-lists-100-recommendations-make-america-healthy-again,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released its strategy to Make America Healthy Again on Tuesday, which officials hope will reduce chronic diseases and align federal policy with their beliefs. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a briefing on the strategy the 128 “recommendations are things that I've been dreaming about my whole life.”Kennedy said he hoped to implement several of the changes before the end of the year, including defining what constitutes an ultra-processed food, updating water quality standards for forever chemicals known as PFAS and changing infant formula standards. The report also includes potentially controversial elements that address access to vaccines, a topic several Republican senators rebuked Kennedy over during a lengthy hearing last week. The 20-page strategy follows the MAHA Commission’s release of its first report in May that outlined four areas of concern — nutrition, physical activity, environmental factors and “overmedicalization.”The proposals in the new report range in scope from issues that have largely been addressed to initiatives that are likely to cause concerns among doctors and reputable medical organizations. For example, the strategy calls on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to “develop guidance on diagnostics and treatments for food allergies,” even though doctors are already able to diagnose and treat those conditions. The report also calls on the FDA to “improve regulatory processes for over-the-counter sunscreen, which has fallen behind other countries.”Vaccine plan to comeThe White House Domestic Policy Council and HHS intend to draft a separate plan addressing the childhood vaccine schedule, vaccine injuries, vaccine science, “misaligned incentives” and “scientific and medical freedom.”Kennedy indicated during the briefing that he may seek to overhaul the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, claiming that 99% of vaccine injuries are not reported, in part, because doctors are not compensated for doing so.  “We are recasting the entire program so that vaccine injuries will be reported; they will be studied; that individuals who suffer them will not be denied, or marginalized, or vilified, or gaslighted,” Kennedy said. “They will be welcomed and we will learn everything we can about them.”The report doesn’t include any plans to reduce pesticide use or to seek solutions to end mass shootings, though Kennedy and others at the event said those are issues the administration will look into. “The firearms question is a complex question and it’s not an easy question,” Kennedy said. “The violence is what we’re concerned with.”Kennedy said that guns have been around for a while and that they also exist in other countries that don’t have nearly the number of mass shootings as the United States, before talking about psychiatric drugs, video games and social media. “We are looking at that at NIH,” Kennedy said, referring to the National Institutes of Health. “We are doing studies now. We’re initiating studies to look at the correlation and the potential connection between overmedicating our kids and this violence.” Kennedy deferred a question about pesticides to White House Domestic Policy Council Director Vince Haley, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. Haley referenced a section in the newly released report titled “cumulative exposure” that said USDA, EPA and NIH will use new approach methodologies “to improve methods for evaluating human health and environmental risks of chemical contaminants.”Rollins told reporters that pesticides require study before being approved and that they are needed to ensure a stable food supply. “Is it a perfect process? Arguably there is no perfect process,” Rollins said. “But it is a strong process that our farmers stand by. And a crop protection tool, such as pesticides, is absolutely essential for America not to compromise our food supply system at this point.”",,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644
,DC,2025-09-09 21:37:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"States’ struggles to comply with new SNAP law will lead to benefit cuts, Dems predict",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-struggles-comply-new-snap-law-will-lead-benefit-cuts-dems-predict,,"Democrats on a U.S. House subcommittee on food and nutrition policy warned Tuesday that big changes to the major federal nutrition assistance program in Republicans’ spending and tax cuts law this year will lead some states to cut benefits.The law that President Donald Trump championed and that Congress passed this summer without any Democratic votes made major alterations in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that increased the burden on state budgets. Members of each party on the U.S. House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition and Foreign Agriculture disagreed during a hearing about the effects of those changes on states.Democrats said the changes would undermine the anti-hunger program’s fundamental goals, while Republicans said they would shore up the program’s long-term health.States predicted to give up on SNAPA panel of three expert witnesses, including the director of the Wyoming department that oversees that state’s SNAP benefits and a Franklin County, Ohio, administrator, said states that could not meet new funding requirements would stop offering the program altogether.“As currently written, if a state cannot meet the benefit cost-sharing and the (administrative) cost-sharing, they would not be able to operate a SNAP program,” Chloe Green, a manager for food programs at the nonpartisan American Public Human Services Association, a trade group that represents state officials overseeing social programs, said in response to a question from Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures.Figures also directed the question to Joy Bivens, the deputy county administrator for health and human services in Franklin County, Ohio, and Korin Schmidt, the director of the Wyoming Department of Family Services. Both said they agreed with Green.“What this bill did was create the potential for SNAP programs to no longer exist in any shape, form or fashion, in terms of providing SNAP benefits in states that could not afford to or chose not to for whatever reason, meet the cost-share,” Figures said.The three witnesses all said that was an accurate assessment of the law.New cost-shareProvisions of the law make states responsible, for the first time, for paying a share of SNAP benefits. The share that states will be responsible for depends on a state’s error payment rate — the percentage of benefit payments that are more or less than the amount that should be paid — with the federal government covering all benefit costs for states that record error rates below 6%. States with higher error rates will be responsible for more funding.Democrats argued the changes would cripple state budgeting efforts.The law also cuts funding for states to administer the program, which Angie Craig, the ranking Democrat on the full committee, said created “a perfect storm.” Reduced federal funding and expanded reporting requirements make errors more likely, while increased errors lead to even less funding, she said.“In effect, Republicans cut their resources and then punished them when overworked staff made more errors administering an increasingly complicated program,” Craig, of Minnesota, said of states. “None of these changes help reduce hunger in our communities.”Republicans defend SNAP decisionsRepublicans downplayed the impact of the law, saying that some Democrats were “fear-mongering” and that the changes would help the program’s long-term health.“Congress can no longer turn a blind eye to states that mismanage federal funds at the expense of vulnerable families,” subcommittee Chairman Brad Finstad, a Minnesota Republican, said.Wisconsin Republican Derrick Van Orden said he grew up on food stamps and wanted to see the program succeed. Requiring states with higher error rates to pay a share of the benefits was about effectively managing the program, he said.“The purpose of that is not to get people off the programs,” Van Orden said. “The purpose of that is to encourage responsible bureaucracy.” States face planning difficultiesStates’ error rates in the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, will determine their cost-share for SNAP for up to two years.But states have not received guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on how to navigate the new system, Green said.That has contributed to confusion for states that are looking at funding SNAP benefits for the first time. “We have heard significant concerns from our members across the country about their states being able to fill the (costs) that have been shifted to them,” she said.Several states that budget on a two-year cycle face the additional challenge of trying to project into the future without knowing what their costs would be, North Carolina Democrat Alma Adams said.“States are being asked to budget now for costs that they won't even know until October 2027,” she said. “Combined with other new cost-share responsibilities for Medicaid cuts in the one big, ugly bill, it puts states in an impossible position.”Wyoming success scalable?Schmidt told the panel that a tool known as front-end eligibility allows her agency to reduce errors. The procedure allows investigations into fraud and other improper paperwork before a payment is issued, reducing the cost of chasing down improper payments after the fact.Wyoming, which Schmidt described as small and conservative, has little room for error.“It's not a good use of our small staff to have to go chase down but rather looking at potential fraud at the beginning of the case and then making the decision about whether or not that case should be considered for benefits,” she said.Republicans on the panel asked Schmidt questions about how Wyoming, which had among the lowest error rates in the nation, at 3.27% in fiscal 2024, was able to run its program with so few errors.But Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern, took issue with the example, saying Wyoming’s model was not sustainable for larger states. Wyoming, which has fewer residents than virtually all U.S. House districts, spends more per person on SNAP than any other state, he said.“I'm glad someone from Wyoming is here to talk about how to reduce error rates,” McGovern said. “Wyoming spends $100 a person on administering SNAP. That's the most in the nation. So if the point of this hearing is to imply that other states should have the same error rate as Wyoming, you're going to need to double or triple how much this country spends on food assistance, not slash food assistance like you did in this big, ugly bill.”",,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Monique Limón's district.,"In summary
A bill released in the final days of the legislative session creates a carve-out from more permissive building rules and appears to target just one project: a proposed apartment building in Sen. Monique Limón’s district.


Earlier this year California lawmakers delivered an historic victory for champions of more housing construction by exempting most urban apartment developments from the California Environmental Quality Act, a 50-year-old statute that Yes In My Backyard advocates and the building industry have long blamed as an impediment to building more homes. 
A bill proposed Monday night, just days before the end of the legislative session, would punch a very small hole in that landmark law that appears to apply to just one proposed apartment building in California — in the district represented by the incoming leader of the state Senate.
Senate Bill 158 would subject any project within a city of more than 85,000 but fewer than 95,000 people and within a county of between 440,000 and 455,000 people to the state’s environmental review law.
That only describes one place in California, according to 2020 Census data: Santa Barbara, a city represented by Sen. Monique Limón.
Earlier this year Democrats in the state Senate chose Limón as the body’s next leader. She is set to replace Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, who is termed out in early 2026.  
The legislation further narrows the exemption to any project that abuts a wetland, a creek and a state registered historical landmark. It also carves out projects larger than four acres and those that have made use of a particular state law known as the “builder’s remedy,” which allows developers to bypass local approval processes if a city is out of compliance with state housing planning law.
On social media, Jordan Grimes with the Bay Area nonprofit Greenbelt Alliance and a frequent poster on land use disputes, noted that all those provisions appear to describe a single 270-unit, eight-story building proposed for a site behind Santa Barbara’s historic mission. The project has been the subject of considerable ire among some of the affluent coastal city’s residents and elected leaders. In May, the Santa Barbara mayor called the project a “horrendous nightmare.”
The developers behind the project, going under the corporate name The Mission LLC, have sued the city multiple times, alleging that local officials have illegally delayed the project and denied it a religious-based property tax exemption.
Responding to a question from CalMatters in a written statement, Limón’s office denied that the bill was “designed to prevent a specific project from moving forward.” 
“This bill clarifies narrow instances when environmental review, public input, and mitigation efforts are required on a development that poses a risk to safety,” the statement reads.
In response to a series of follow-up questions, Limón’s office confirmed the senator was responsible for the new legislative language, but refused to explain whether the Mission project is one of the “narrow instances” in which additional review is required and whether there are, in fact, any others. 
Project has local opposition
Opponents of the Mission project, which is located at the mouth of a canyon north of Santa Barbara’s downtown, have raised concerns about wildfires and flooding risk.
The City of Santa Barbara has argued that the CEQA exemption law from earlier this year does not apply to the project. That’s based on the city’s interpretation of the law. The budget bill introduced this week would legally reinforce that position.
In an email, Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse said he would not comment on the project, citing “frequent and continuing litigation with the applicants.” 
Richard Jacobs, a lawyer representing The Mission LCC, refused to comment for this story on behalf of his client.
The last-minute exemption is part of a broader budget trailer bill — legislation that is meant to direct state agencies on how to administer the year’s budget, but which in practice often become vehicles for a variety of policy changes. Unlike other legislation, budget bills are not authored by individual legislators, but by the entire budget committee. 
This year has seen the Legislature take up a bevy of uber-ambitious housing production bills, aimed at making it easier for developers to build in the face of a chronic statewide housing affordability crisis. Throughout the year, a political schism has emerged between the Assembly, helmed by “Yes In My Backyard”-aligned Speaker Robert Rivas, and the Senate, which has been less receptive to that ideology. 
For those hoping to divine how the Senate under Limón’s leadership might welcome pro-development legislation, the 11th-hour carve out is potentially telling.
“Is the incoming leader of the California senate sneakily trying to kill a proposed 250 unit apartment building in Santa Barbara via a budget trailer bill? It certainly seems like it!,” Grimes wrote on X.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081825_Redistricting-Battle-Presser_MG_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Ken Herndon, who represents the city’s fourth district on the Louisville Metro Council, said Tuesday that statewide laws preempting local control of gun laws are “ridiculous” and that if they were gone he would propose a waiting period for gun purchases in Louisville. 
“All localities in this state have been denied the ability to use legislation to protect our children,” Herndon said. “We owe our children every effort we can muster, with every tool at our disposal, and currently, that tool is not available to us.”  
Should the resolution pass and the General Assembly grant Louisville local control, Herndon said a waiting period when purchasing guns is at the “top of my list.” 
“At the end of the day, the choice is clear to me that it’s our guns or our kids, and I choose our kids,” Herndon said. 
A 2012 Kentucky law bans local governments from regulating the “manufacture, sale, purchase, taxation, transfer, ownership, possession, carrying, storage, or transportation of firearms, ammunition, components of firearms, components of ammunition, firearms accessories or combination thereof.” 
Another law from 2015 dictates that local governments can dispose of firearms only by selling them. This law also was criticized in the aftermath of the 2023 mass shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville, when Mayor Craig Greenberg said the city should be allowed to destroy guns used in crimes and confiscated by police rather than having them sold at public auction. 
Herndon wants the General Assembly to revise both laws, saying the Republican-controlled legislature has already demonstrated its willingness to make laws specific to Jefferson County. In recent years, the legislature’s Republican supermajority —  over the opposition of Democratic lawmakers representing Louisville — has mandated nonpartisan elections for Louisville mayor and council, limited the authority of the local school board and more. 
Herndon made his announcement outside the Western Library near the sites of recent shootings. In one instance, a woman who was walking a child to the school bus stop was fatally shot. In another case nearby, a teenager had fired shots near Central High School and Coleridge-Taylor Montessori Elementary. 
Dustin Isaacs, a spokesman for the Senate President’s office, said Herndon’s resolution is “symbolic” while “the successes of the Kentucky General Assembly in making communities safer are very real.” 
“Lawmakers have a responsibility to protect constitutional rights,” Isaacs said. “The cited statutes protect fundamental rights of law-abiding citizens and create uniformity across all 120 Kentucky counties.” 
“Just as Louisville cannot create an exception to limit a citizen’s right to a trial by jury within its borders, it cannot carve out exceptions to the Second Amendment. It’s worth noting that many of the measures cited in the resolution, such as background checks and mental health restrictions, already exist under federal or state law,” he said. “Regarding the disposition of firearms, the General Assembly has already acted in this area through the Safer Kentucky Act, which allows for the destruction of homicide firearms under state law.” 
Herndon’s resolution cites polling in support of background checks and mental health screens. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia impose some form of waiting period on firearms purchasers.
On Monday, Metro Council Republicans presented a “Safer Louisville” plan with a slew of policy suggestions that “either address aspects of crime that oftentimes escalate into greater more dangerous criminal activity, seek to improve safe behavior or support efforts to bring more officers to our neighborhoods,” the plan says. 
Policies in this proposal include:

Submit amendments to the Louisville Metro Code of Ordinances to make it an offense (citation) for someone to pass money, food, or other items from their vehicle while on Louisville Metro Arterial Roads. 
Work with the Goodwill’s Another Way Program and other groups to create an education campaign that will include signage to help educate persons that streetside and sidewalk almsgiving or panhandling are not effective and oftentimes counterproductive towards helping persons. 
Invest funding from their Neighborhood Development Funds to create two pilot programs where streetlights are added to areas designated by police as being locations of higher levels of crime. 
Seek additional funding through partnerships with state and other agencies to construct a new, state-of-the-art training facility for regional first responders. 
Sponsor a resolution from members of the Metro Council strongly advocating that the governor and Justice Cabinet do everything it can to expedite the opening of a Juvenile Justice Facility within Jefferson County. 
And more. 

“When each member of our caucus campaigned for office, they cited improving public safety as their top priority,” Republican Caucus Chair Anthony Piagentini of District 19 said in a statement. “Although we have already successfully executed some changes, there is a lot more work to do. We believe that Louisville can be one of the safest cities in the country. To accomplish that, we have developed this plan that we wanted to share with the public to further this goal. We cannot have a successful city until we have a safe city.”
Christopher 2X advocates against violence in Louisville
Christopher 2X, who advocates against violence in Louisville and runs Game Changers, which mentors youth in Jefferson County, said he can’t challenge anyone’s ideas for making the city safer. 
But, he said, change has to happen beyond the guns themselves, because people can find ways to access and misuse guns regardless of laws. 
Effectively addressing gun violence, he said, means going upstream and addressing why people want to engage in “reckless gun play” in the first place. 
In addition to the gun reforms, Herndon wants to ensure there are crosswalks at all bus stops, start a chess league for youth in his district and more. 
“I welcome all serious, good efforts,” 2X told the Lantern. “Will young people still be willing and ready to find weapons, even with new laws? Absolutely they will. And that’s not a knock on anybody. We’ve got to go after these mindsets even harder.”

(Courtesy photo)A remediation agreement signed in July shows Jennifer-Ruth Green was already the subject of an inspector general investigation into alleged misuse of state resources and workplace misconduct before her sudden resignation as Indiana’s public safety secretary last week.
The document, obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, shows Gov. Mike Braun’s office agreed to allow her to remain in her position “pending the results of the Office of Inspector General investigation with appropriate safeguards in place to prevent additional ethics violations, including additional ethics training.”
The governor’s office conducted an expedited internal review of the allegations in mid-June after learning about the OIG investigation, which began in February.
The six-page document was signed later, on July 21, by Green; Josh Kelley, Gov. Mike Braun’s chief of staff; and Patrick Price, the governor’s general counsel. It warned that if allegations denied by Green are later substantiated, “appropriate steps will be determined at that time, up to and including termination.”
Indiana Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green resigns

Among the allegations against Green are claims that she used state vehicles and travel cards for personal and political purposes, and that she directed state employees to assist with those activities during work hours.
Additional accusations center around inappropriate workplace conduct, ranging from “conversations with employees about personal relationships, intimate subjects, or sexual activities,” to “uninvited touching of employees” and retaliation.
Green has denied most of the allegations, state officials said in the agreement, although she admitted to “limited” personal use of state vehicles and “having a financial relationship with an employee” without disclosing the conflict of interest.
Messages seeking comment from Green were not returned Tuesday. She is currently out of the state for guard training.
When asked about the allegations and remediation agreement, Griffin Reid — a spokesperson for Braun’s office — said only that, “we don’t comment on specific personnel matters.”
The public safety secretary is an appointee of the governor.
The Indiana State Personnel Department confirmed to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that Green resigned Sept. 5. A spokesperson for SPD said Green has no discipline in her record “which resulted in suspension, demotion or discharge.”
While Green’s case is not listed on the Indiana State Ethics Commission’s public agenda, commissioners are scheduled for an executive session on Thursday to discuss “an individual’s alleged misconduct.”
Allegations outlined
The remediation agreement revealed that “ethics concerns were raised” in late February about an “event (Green) hosted on state property,” and that “those concerns were referred to the Office of Inspector General for investigation.”
The event in question was a Feb. 28 meet-and-greet at the state government center in Indianapolis, which invited attendees to “Come by and meet Secretary Green along with her family!” The flyer said to send questions to an outside political consultant.

By mid-June, the OIG investigation was “potentially expanding into additional areas of potential ethics violations,” officials wrote in the remediation agreement. 
The Indiana Inspector General is responsible for investigating and addressing fraud, waste, abuse, and wrongdoing in any agency within the executive branch of state government.
The agreement alleged she used state vehicles and travel cards for personal events. She also allegedly directed state employees to generate and post content on her personal social media pages and asked them to staff personal or political events.
The agreement further suggests that Green promoted her book and brand, “Battle-Proven Leadership,” during state time or with state employees and resources. She was also accused of asking staff to perform personal errands, including driving family members and completing tasks at her residence.
Other accusations detailed in the agreement include holding political meetings in her state office, facilitating fundraisers and attending political events using state resources.
Green’s workplace behavior was also flagged in the remediation document, specifically around allegations that her conduct “made female employees uncomfortable.” 
“This conduct includes: making comments about female employees’ clothing/body in front of other employees; your uninvited touching of female employees; your discussing personal relationships/intimate subjects during work hours with female employees,” according to the agreement.
Retaliation claims were documented, too: “Staff who have tried to advise you of concerns have felt retaliated against/punished/put in the doghouse as a result.”
The agreement states that in a June 30 meeting, Green acknowledged limited wrongdoing. 
She “admitted to some violations, including that the state vehicle has been used on limited occasions for personal use, state employees had generated content for your personal social media pages, and to having a financial relationship (rent) with an employee whom you hired.”
She denied the other allegations.
Pending ethics investigation
State officials, in the remediation agreement, imposed a series of requirements for Green’s continued employment within Indiana’s government.
Green was instructed to reimburse the state for mileage and gas costs associated with personal and political use of her state vehicle. 
She was specifically barred from using a state vehicle for any other political purposes, such as traveling to and from campaign events, and could not ask subordinates to staff political appearances.
Green was also tasked with “a mandatory ethics training refresher” hosted jointly by OIG, and ethics counsel from the governor’s office.

The agreement additionally emphasized promotion of an “appropriate workplace” and prohibited Green from any “uninvited touching,” making comments about an employee’s appearance, or discussing “personal relationships, intimate subjects or sexual activities” with staff.
In addition, Green was forbidden from retaliating against any employee who participated in ongoing investigations.
“You need to have and foster as normal a work environment as possible,” the signed agreement stated.
A possible congressional run
Braun said on Saturday Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott will take on an expanded role as the new secretary of public safety.
Green’s resignation came less than a year after she joined Braun’s cabinet and could open the door for a second congressional bid.
She has been a rising figure in state Republican politics since her 2022 run for U.S. Congress in Indiana’s 1st District, where she mounted a competitive challenge to Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. 
Despite losing that race, Green came within 5 percentage points in a traditionally Democratic stronghold.
Tim Edson, who served as Green’s consultant on her 2022 congressional race, told the Capital Chronicle on Monday that Green “is seriously weighing another run for Congress in northwest Indiana and Republican leaders in Indiana and nationally are encouraging her to enter the race.”
Republicans are currently considering mid-cycle redistricting, aiming to grow the number of GOP-held seats in Congress. The 1st District, along with Marion County’s 7th District, are both held by Democrats.
Green, a combat veteran and cybersecurity expert, had been appointed to the post in December as part of Braun’s incoming administration. At the time, Braun said her “military and cybersecurity background made her uniquely qualified to lead Indiana’s public safety agencies.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-09-09 21:23:29+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ watchdog’s probe of public insurance funds alleges ‘covert takeover’ by private interests,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/09/nj-watchdogs-probe-of-public-insurance-funds-alleges-covert-takeover-by-private-interests/,The comptroller said his review suggests a single private firm effectively gained control of New Jersey’s public insurance pools.,"Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh blocked procurement proposals by two joint insurance funds after finding longstanding undisclosed conflicts of interest and other contracting law violations. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The state comptroller said Tuesday that he found a bevy of violations at three public joint insurance funds that include the steering of contracts to favored and politically connected vendors, contracting law infractions and conflicts of interest that went undisclosed for years.
In a new report, acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh said an investigation launched by his office suggests a single private firm — insurance company Conner Strong & Buckelew — had effectively gained control of New Jersey’s public insurance pools.
Conner Strong, one of the nation’s largest insurance firms, was founded by South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, who left the firm last year after he was indicted on unrelated racketeering charges later thrown out by a Superior Court judge.
Walsh claims that Conner Strong and a related entity operating under the name PERMA for years failed to tell regulators or the joint insurance funds that they are legally and practically a single business. Walsh’s report says Conner Strong and PERMA’s employees overlap, the two companies share leadership, and in many cases, they write rules for how a contract will be awarded — then compete for and win that same contract.
“This consolidation of control by a vendor happened without adequate disclosure, competition or accountability,” the report says. “The result is an unauthorized covert takeover of a core public function by a private entity — and a serious risk to public trust and public dollars.”
Walsh blocked procurements proposed by two of the joint insurance funds as a result of his findings.
Dan Fee, a spokesperson for Norcross, said Norcross has not returned to Conner Strong since his departure last year. Fee challenged the veracity of the comptroller’s report, likening it to Attorney General Matt Platkin’s now-dismissed indictment of Norcross (Platkin is appealing the dismissal).
“Like Matt Platkin’s case against Norcross and his allies in rebuilding Camden — a case which was quickly dismissed by the courts — today’s Comptroller report is rife with factual inaccuracies and evinces a fundamental lack of understanding of the issues,” he said.
Fee’s statement did not identify the inaccuracies.
Past reviews by regulators at the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Department of Community Affairs and a previous comptroller had found the health insurance funds to be in compliance with state law and regulation, Fee said.
Walsh’s report says the lack of notice to regulators about the nature of PERMA and Conner Strong’s relationship “explains why no concerns were raised by regulators.”

Clear conflict?
Joint insurance funds are a statutory purchasing mechanism for local government units like municipalities, counties and school boards. Individual government units pool their workers to dilute risk and to secure health and other insurance products at lower prices than they could individually.
Some joint insurance funds have seen enrollment spike as municipalities flee the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program, which faces a death spiral due to years of soaring premiums driving governments off the system and sending premiums yet higher, spurring more departures.
Walsh’s review found PERMA’s executive director operated as the administrator for three joint insurance funds — the Southern New Jersey Regional Employee Benefits Fund, the Schools Health Insurance Fund, and the Municipal Reinsurance Health Insurance Fund — for which Conner Strong was a program manager.
State regulations bar joint insurance fund administrators, who manage day-to-day operations, from simultaneously serving as program managers, who provide actuarial and other professional services.
Procurements issued by the Southern New Jersey Regional Employee Benefits Fund in May and June of 2024 were designed to exclude other vendors, the comptroller said. The fund provides benefits to more than 9,500 enrollees across 40 local government units in South Jersey.
Those requests for proposals, which sought carriers to act as third-party administrators, were initially submitted under standards that are disallowed for cooperative purchasing, which requires solicitations award the lowest responsible bidder, the report says.
The solicitations were drawn to benefit existing vendors by requiring that bids include equivalents for roughly 100 health plan designs, the comptroller said. They allowed bidders to submit equivalent offerings but did not provide technical or other data that bidders would need to demonstrate equivalency, he said. 
“Essentially, the specification was so narrowly tailored that it was designed specifically for the incumbent vendor,” the comptroller’s report says.
The procurements’ structure would have afforded PERMA and Conner Strong sole control over procurement for six joint insurance funds covering nearly 300 government entities and covering just under 110,000 individuals, the report says.
Walsh’s office found similar issues in a June 2024 solicitation issued by the Schools Health Insurance Fund when it was seeking a program manager. The report says PERMA’s executive director oversaw prior procurements for the fund that awarded Conner Strong a program manager contract despite the executive director being a Conner Strong employee.
The executive director’s financial disclosure listed Conner Strong as an employer and source of income, but did not mention PERMA. The executive director, whom the report does not name, told the comptroller’s office that Conner Strong management, a likely bidder, reviewed the school insurance fund’s solicitation before it was submitted to the comptroller’s office for review (state law requires the comptroller to review procurement proposals where the worth of a contract is expected to exceed certain dollar amounts, which vary year-to-year).
“This process, which is legally required to be fair, objective, and focused on protecting taxpayer funds, was instead managed by CSB, the incumbent vendor, which reviewed its own proposals and interpreted the procurement rules, ultimately compromising the integrity of the process through bias,” the comptroller’s report says. “Conflicts of interest do not get any clearer than this.”
Joseph DiBella, who oversees Conner Strong’s marketing department, did not return requests for comment sent to his email addresses at Conner Strong and PERMA.
The Schools Health Insurance Fund denied a conflict of interest in correspondence to the comptroller. The comptroller’s office took that as a suggestion that the fund intended to award the new contract to Conner Strong and denied the procurement proposal.
Walsh’s office also raised concerns about the legality of the Municipal Reinsurance Health Insurance Fund, noting its members — other joint insurance funds — are not local or contracting units permitted to create joint insurance funds under state law.
Regulators should review the municipal reinsurance fund’s role in Hi Fund, a marketing brand for PERMA and Conner Strong that falsely claimed it acted as a health insurance pool and used officials’ likenesses in advertising online and at the New Jersey League of Municipalities annual conference, apparently without their knowledge, Walsh said.
Walsh’s report calls Hi Fund “a front used to generate business” for Conner Strong. After an interview with the comptroller’s office, Hi Fund added a disclaimer to its web pages noting it is only a branding name and not a company, the report says.
Hi Fund’s logo appeared on procurement documents submitted by the Southern New Jersey fund, and neither PERMA’s executive director nor the municipal reinsurance fund’s qualified purchasing agent could explain why, the comptroller’s report says
“Notably, there are no indications that the financial interests and potential conflicts of interest resulting from PERMA/CSB’s and CSB’s creation of the Hi Fund have been disclosed to DOBI or HIF trustees,” Walsh said.
The comptroller’s office directed the insurance funds to submit corrective plans detailing how they will eliminate conflicts of interest, enforce the prohibition barring program managers and administrators from the same firm, and detail how they will secure insurance-related services in compliance with procurement laws. It suggested legislators boost oversight of joint insurance funds.
The office referred its findings to the Departments of Banking and Insurance and Community Affairs, the School Ethics Commission, and the Division of Consumer Affairs.
Fee’s response to Tuesday’s report notes that Walsh will likely be out as the state’s comptroller when a new governor takes office in January.
“This new report should be seen for what it is: an investigation conducted by a politically motivated Acting-Comptroller for his own self-promotion on his way out the door,” Fee said.

The goal of the effort, led by Kansas-City-based hemp business American Shaman, is to repeal the 41-page constitutional amendment that legalized recreational marijuana in 2022. 
Each version of the proposed initiative petition would replace the marijuana legalization amendment with language that instructs Missouri lawmakers to create regulations that are “no more burdensome than what we already have for alcohol and tobacco,” said Eapen Thampy, a longtime hemp lobbyist.
“Marijuana and hemp are one plant,” Thampy said in an interview Tuesday. “They should be regulated in the same way. It should be a free, fair and regulated market.”
The effort is being organized under a new political action committee called Missourians for a Single Market.
The four petitions differ slightly, but they each would take out criminal offenses for possessing too much marijuana. They’d also retain the current taxes on the products for at least the next 10 years, and allow businesses to obtain licenses to sell the products through a similar process as they do with alcohol and tobacco products. 
Currently marijuana facility licenses are limited and highly regulated, but businesses don’t need a license to sell intoxicating hemp products — despite numerous legislative attempts to outright ban them. 
“Legislative efforts to ban hemp products allow the illegal market to flourish,” said Gary Wiegert, a retired St. Louis City police sergeant, in the group’s Tuesday press release announcing the initiative petition campaign. “Regulating these products and preserving legal access to the market ensures public safety by allowing business owners to serve the consumer market instead.”
Hemp lobbyist Eapen Thampy and Deb Nash of Canna Answers filed four initiative petitions on hemp and marijuana regulations on Tuesday with the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office in Jefferson City (photo submitted).
In many ways, it’s the latest showdown between the marijuana industry, which has operated legally in Missouri since 2018 but is still outlawed federally,  and the hemp industry, whose products were legalized by the 2018 Farm Bill.
At the end of the day, what’s the difference between intoxicating hemp products and intoxicating marijuana products?
Hemp and marijuana are essentially terms the government uses to distinguish between the part of the cannabis plant that has high amounts of THC, or their psychoactive component.
Any part of the plant containing 0.3% or less THC by dry weight is defined as hemp. And that’s why in 2018 Congress removed hemp and hemp seeds from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s schedule of controlled substances as part of the Farm Bill.
Cannabis buds – or what the industry calls “flower” – must be smoked or heated to release Delta-9 THC that produces a high. 
So eating most raw cannabis flower shouldn’t get someone high.
There is a growing legal argument that marijuana sold in dispensaries that doesn’t contain .3% Delta-9 THC before it’s smoked or heated is actually hemp.
Currently, a number of Missouri cannabis events – where people are selling weed outside of dispensaries – are operating under this interpretation of the federal definition.
The initiative petitions filed Tuesday support this interpretation. 
The effort also aims to regulate products, such as edibles, beverages and vapes, that are currently being sold in gas stations and stores without any testing or tracking requirements. The lack of state regulation has led some municipal governments to try and find a way to regulate them through city health departments. 
“Our position is that marijuana legalization has always been not about getting ‘high’ but to end prohibition against one of the most beneficial plants on earth,” said Tim Gilio, founder of the Missouri Marijuana Legalization Movement. “Our goal is to open up a free and open market to all and prevent a monopoly from encroaching on any benefits of the cannabis plant.”
However, Andrew Mullins, executive director for the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, told The Independent in June that the idea is a “bait and switch.” 
The state’s regulated marijuana industry, he said, generated $241 million in state and local tax revenues last year alone and is regarded as one of the most successful marijuana programs in the country, citing a Wall Street Journal article. At a marijuana industry conference last week, company leaders agreed that limited licenses for dispensaries and grow facilities was key to Missouri’s success. 
Voters have twice voted for cannabis regulation, Mullins said in June, and any effort to roll back those constitutional protections would be a “spectacular failure.”
“Missourians aren’t about to take hundreds of millions away from local communities, veterans and our justice system, all in hopes that politicians will eventually replace it with something down the road,” Mullins said.  
Thampy said that tax revenue wouldn’t go away. The taxable market would increase by about a third, he said, “meaning tens of millions in new revenue for public defenders, substance abuse prevention, and the Missouri Veterans Commission.”
The petitions were filed with the Missouri Secretary of State on Tuesday afternoon. The group aims to get enough signatures by May to appear on the November 2026 ballot.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5345-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)From a seven-digit campaign account to high-profile public appearances and a growing payroll, all signs pointed to Helena Buonanno Foulkes’ return to Rhode Island politics.
But the former CVS executive and 2022 Democratic gubernatorial candidate couldn’t resist one last teaser.
“2026 is going to be a very big year,” she told the standing-room only crowd at Roger Williams Park Casino Tuesday. “I am excited to share today, wait for it, that I am going to be a grandmother.”
Seconds later, Foulkes confirmed the actual reason for the splashy event billed by her campaign as a “major announcement” — her candidacy in the 2026 gubernatorial race. The announcement cements a rematch between Foulkes and Gov. Dan McKee, who faced off in a four-way Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2022. Foulkes lost to McKee in 2022 by three percentage points.
The 61-year-old Providence resident has already built a bigger war chest for her comeback, with $2.1 million cash on hand as of June 30 compared with McKee’s $879,000, according to reports filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. Foulkes recently hired veteran campaign consultant Eric Hyers, who managed successful congressional campaigns for former U.S. Rep David Cicilline and former Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo. McKee’s campaign manager left three weeks ago, months after he was hired.
Hours before Foulkes made her 2026 candidacy official Tuesday, McKee’s campaign released a digital attack ad on YouTube doubling down on Foulkes’ role in the opioid crisis. The 60-second ad and corresponding website, sheknew.com, cites the late 2024 U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit, claiming CVS executives perpetuated the opioid epidemic, with a top-down leadership style that prevented employees from speaking up against wrongdoings. Foulkes left her post as president of CVS Pharmacy Inc. in 2018, ending a 25-year career with the Woonsocket company that included four years leading its pharmaceutical arm. Her executive role partially overlapped with the time frame of the DOJ complaint.
The 97-page federal lawsuit against CVS never identifies Foulkes by name.
Foulkes in a sit-down interview following her announcement on Tuesday defended her record at CVS, as well as the company overall, pointing to its efforts starting in 2017 to reduce opioid misuse and addiction by limiting supply, expanding access to overdose reversal drugs and increasing efforts to prevent prescription fraud and abuse.
CVS in a statement Tuesday called McKee’s attack ad “unfortunate and discouraging.”
“It’s also inappropriate to disparage and intentionally misrepresent the contributions of our 7,000 colleagues who live and work in a state we’ve called home for more than 50 years,” the company stated.

The blame game 
Turning the heat back on McKee Tuesday, Foulkes pointed to the most recent major employer to jump ship under his watch. On Monday, Pawtucket toy and gaming empire Hasbro Inc. announced it would abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots in favor of a new headquarters in the Boston Seaport by the end of 2026. 
The loss of Hasbro was far from Foulkes’ only critique of McKee. From failure to provide the funds necessary to prevent cuts to Rhode Island Public Transit Authority to the ongoing delays and rising costs over the Washington Bridge rebuild, she made her dissatisfaction with the four-year incumbent clear. 
“Five years, people,” Foulkes said, referring to the time lapse between when the westbound highway shuttered, and the expected November 2028 completion date. “I gave birth to four children in four-and-a-half years.”










Five years, people. I gave birth to four children in four-and-a-half years. 


– Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Helena Buonanno Foulkes on the time lapse between the December 2023 closure of the Washington Bridge and the expected November 2028 completion date.


Blasting the state’s leadership broadly for “incompetence” and bureaucracy,” she took aim at its bloated spending, including the $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget.
“Last session, our leaders did what Rhode Island has done for years,” Foulkes said. “Tape together a budget, add some new fees and raise taxes, throw in an accounting gimmick or two, make some insiders and lobbyists happy. Fail to be accountable. Fail to plan.”
Later, in an interview Foulkes acknowledged that the governor does not have sole authority over the state budget, which is largely shaped by the Rhode Island General Assembly, and specifically, the House Speaker. 
“But I think the governor could have asserted a lot more control,” she said of McKee’s role in crafting the final fiscal 2026 spending plan. As for McKee’s decision not to sign the final product, but not to veto it either, Foulkes concluded, “That seems like a very weak way to go about building a budget.”
In contrast, she described herself as a candidate with “guts,” willing to take a stand, whether it be on full funding for public transportation, the Republican-backed push for a state inspector general, or President Donald Trump’s administration. Her critique of Trump was even more scathing than her words for McKee. Foulkes called the president “reckless, irresponsible and belligerent.”

Taking a stand
While McKee has come out swinging against the Trump administration in recent weeks after federal regulators ordered work to stop on the almost completed Revolution Wind order, he has been more muted on consequences of federal budget cuts, grant suspensions and immigration and education policies.
“When I look at all the Democratic governors, I don’t think that Gov. McKee has been at all on the front line,” Foulkes said later. “My biggest criticism is that he’s not planning ahead for Rhode Islanders.”
She concluded her 20-minute speech by declaring, “our current governor does not deserve a third term,” punctuated by singer Lizzo’s pop anthem, “It’s about damn time.”
The crowd was a who’s who of state officials, business executives and community leaders, including Democratic Sens. Sam Zurier, of Providence, and Lou DiPalma, of Middletown, and Democratic Reps. Mark McKenney, of Warwick, and Robert Phillips, of Woonsocket. Rhode Island Democratic Party Chair Liz Beretta-Perik, Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. and Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence Executive Director Melissa Carden also attended.
Foulkes started her day with breakfast in Central Falls with Mayor Maria Rivera and Dr. Pablo Rodriguez, a public health and political commentator with his own radio show. Her afternoon agenda included talking to East Providence business owners, followed by a community gathering at an East Providence resident’s home, according to her campaign. Foulkes plans to hold community meetings in all 39 cities and towns this fall.
Two other potential contenders for the 2026 governor’s race, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, and 2022 Republican candidate Ashley Kalus, each weighed in with individual statements Tuesday.
Shekarchi, who remains the top fundraiser in the state with more than $3.8 million cash on hand, welcomed Foulkes’ candidacy.
“I applaud anyone willing to pursue public service, which from my experience is challenging, yet rewarding,” Shekarchi said. “The voters will decide next year which candidate for governor has the strongest record of delivering for working families and the best ideas to lead Rhode Island.”
Kalus denounced Foulkes for a track record of “failed corporate leadership” and the timing of her announcement on the heels of Hasbro’s departure as “political opportunism.”
“Her campaign isn’t a bid for leadership; it’s a liquidation sale for the state of Rhode Island,” Kalus said. “Voters deserve better than another well-connected insider cashing out at our expense.”

According to a news release from the university, UNI leadership and Iowa National Guard partners spent the summer exploring ways to keep cadets learning on campus after hearing the news in late June.
The university’s Reserve Officer Training Corps program will continue to operate on campus as an “extension unit” of the program offered by the University of Iowa, according to the release. Those enrolled in the UNI program will remain on campus for all four years of their training.

“The Army’s decision affirms the strength of UNI’s ROTC program and ensures that students can continue to pursue their education and military training right here in Cedar Falls,” said UNI President Mark Nook in the release. “Many individuals, from our faculty and staff to the Iowa National Guard and Army, made it possible to find a path forward for our cadets.”
UNI spokesperson Adam Amdor said in an email the university will continue to provide the necessary facilities, office support and academic oversight for program participants, but the program’s commanding officer will be housed at the UI. He said details on how many instructors and staff will work from UNI are still being discussed.
UNI was one of 10 “host units” selected for inactivation by U.S. Army Cadet Command, joined by institutions in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Missouri, North Carolina, California and New York. Other ROTC units across the U.S. are also seeing changes to their status and level of operation.
Any student can take ROTC courses for the first two years of the program without any commitment to the Army or military experience, according to the program website, and those who do complete the four-year program will graduate with a commission as a 2nd lieutenant in the Army and serve in “one of 18 different career fields.”
Coming into its 40th year of operation at UNI, the ROTC program had 50 total enrollees as of Sept. 9, Amdor said in an email.
“We are proud of our longstanding partnership with the Army and of the generations of leaders who have come through this program,” said Brenda Bass, dean of the UNI College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, in the release. “UNI’s ROTC program is academically strong and has some of the best facilities in the region. We are grateful to Army ROTC Cadet Command and the Iowa National Guard for their innovative collaboration that will allow UNI’s proud ROTC legacy to continue.”

Several people were exposed to and infected with measles after attending a Utah High School Cycling League event at Soldier Hollow on Aug. 16, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release issued Monday. 
About 2,000 people attended that event. Health officials said they’re monitoring for any additional cases from that event and other league gatherings. 
“Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily, even at outdoor events,” state epidemiologist Leisha Nolen said in a prepared statement. “Given the number of people who may have been exposed to measles at Soldier Hollow on August 16, 2025, we encourage attendees and participants of upcoming Utah High School Cycling League Region 6 events to check their (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination status.”

State health officials said they’re working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families of race participants who attended the event at Soldier Hollow about the measles exposure. 
“We are also working collaboratively to help prevent spread at ongoing practices and upcoming events,” state health officials said. 
Utah’s measles outbreak continues to grow, with 24 confirmed cases as of Monday, according to the state’s 2025 measles dashboard. Fourteen of those cases have been confirmed in southwest Utah. 
The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine helps protect people from measles, and it’s one of the most safe and effective tools to control the spread of the viral infection. Two doses are recommended for children ages 4 and older. 
Of Utah’s 24 confirmed cases so far, 21 were not vaccinated, according to the state’s dashboard. Eleven are younger than 18 years old, while 11 are older. 
Measles symptoms usually begin to surface one to two weeks after exposure, health officials said. Symptoms include a mild to moderate fever with a cough, runny nose, and red watery eyes. Days later, the fever typically spikes, and is followed by a blotchy, red rash that can appear red or darker than usual skin tone around the face, hairline and ears. The rash then rapidly spreads downward to the rest of the body.
“If you develop symptoms, you should stay away from other people and call your healthcare provider,” state officials said. “Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure.”

,DC,2025-09-09 21:00:17+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Supreme Court rules Trump administration can refuse to spend $4B in foreign aid for now,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-rules-trump-administration-can-refuse-spend-4b-foreign-aid-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Trump administration can temporarily hold on to $4 billion in foreign aid funding approved by Congress, overturning a lower court’s order and continuing a struggle over who controls the nation’s purse strings. The one-page ruling from the emergency docket, signed by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., came just one day after the administration appealed the lower court’s ruling. While the original lawsuit over withheld foreign aid began in February and stemmed from an executive order, the Trump administration sent Congress a rescissions request covering some of the spending in late August. The proposal is part of the formal process laid out in a 1974 law that allows the president to ask lawmakers to cancel previously approved spending. Congress typically has 45 days to approve, modify, or disagree with a rescissions request. During that time the president can legally freeze the funding and only has to spend it if lawmakers don’t approve the plan.  This particular rescission request, however, was sent to lawmakers within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year, creating a dispute that complicated the nature of the original lawsuit. That maneuver, sometimes called a pocket rescission, is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and several members of Congress, though White House budget director Russ Vought believes it's within the bounds of the law. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Trump administration’s appeal that the federal district court’s order to spend the funding “requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself.”“Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients,” he added. The Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday doesn’t address whether the justices agree with the administration that it can refuse to spend the billions in foreign aid since it sent the rescissions request close to the end of the fiscal year. Roberts wrote “that the September 3, 2025 order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, case Nos. 1:25-cv-400 and 1:25-cv-402, is hereby partially stayed for funds that are subject to the President’s August 28, 2025 recission proposal currently pending before Congress pending further order of the undersigned or of the Court. It is further ordered that a response to the application be filed on or before Friday, September 12th, 2025, by 4 p.m. (EDT).”",,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Florida’s average score in the College Free Speech Rankings was 63.1 out of 100, dropping 1.1 from the year before. However, Florida’s average rank out of 257 was 74, rising 25 spots since the year before. 
Not all institutions in Florida were rated; FIRE queried students at six public institutions and one private, the University of Miami. Florida State University scored highest in the state at 17th nationally of 257 schools. UM was the least favorable at 229th. 


FIRE Free Speech rankings

FSU: 17th C-
USF: 24th C-
UF: 45th D
FIU: 53rd D
FAU: 68th D-
UCF: 80th D-
UM: 229th F



Following a academic-like grading scale, FIRE’s scoring gave only 11 schools a C or better and 166 of the 257 schools surveyed got an F. 
Florida’s average grade was a D, while the national average was F. 
Schools were graded on students’ comfort expressing ideas, disruptive conduct, openness, self-censorship, administrative support, and political tolerance.
Students were surveyed during the spring semester. Since then, an FSU employee wearing an Israel Defense Forces was charged with battery after allegedly hitting a student criticizing Israel and saying “free Palestine.” That encounter created headlines and prompted FSU to issue a formal response.

The survey found that 34% of Florida students said using violence to stop people from speaking on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases. That number is the same as the national average.
Twice as many, 68%, said shouting down a speaker to silence them while on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases. That number is 3% lower than the national average.

FIRE is involved in a lawsuit against Florida, litigating against the Stop WOKE Act. That law restricts classroom instruction related to “race, color, national origin, or sex.” 
In that lawsuit, an attorney for the state asserted authority to control professors’ content, “because in the classroom, the professor’s speech is the government’s speech, and the government can restrict professors on a content-wide basis … .” 
That case remains pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
That does not heavily dampen Florida schools’ scores, since scoring is based on students’ expression, not on faculty’s, FIRE said. 
Nationwide, FIRE said, “conservative students are increasingly joining their liberal peers in supporting censorship.”
The rankings “show a continued decline in support for free speech among all students, but particularly conservatives. Students of every political persuasion show a deep unwillingness to encounter controversial ideas,” FIRE said in a news release announcing the results. 
Students in the state were surveyed on how often they hide political beliefs in attempts to get a better grade: 34% said never, 30% said rarely, 21% said once or twice a month, 9% said a couple of times a week, and 6% said nearly every day.
42% of students in Florida said they feel their school has made it somewhat clear that free speech is protected on campus and 38% say it is very or extremely clear.
FSU was identified as a “consistently ‘good’ school for free speech.”
Harvard University, 245th, and Columbia University, 256th, rank near the bottom, while Claremont McKenna College, Purdue University, and the University of Chicago claimed the top three spots. 
“This year, students largely opposed allowing any controversial campus speaker, no matter that speaker’s politics,” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said in a news release. 
“Rather than hearing out and then responding to an ideological opponent, both liberal and conservative college students are retreating from the encounter entirely. This will only harm students’ ability to think critically and create rifts between them. We must champion free speech on campus as a remedy to our culture’s deep polarization.”
The survey found that for every “conservative student,” there are 1.57 “liberal students.”
Last year, a state survey comparing Florida students to nationwide numbers found that the Sunshine State was home to more Republican students than the national average.

The Select Subcommittee on Federal Impacts on Minnesotans and Economic Stability will have Republican and DFL members, and will travel around the state to hear from Minnesotans impacted by the recent changes to federal law: farmers, hospital administrators, people reliant on food or medical assistance, and more. 
The new law, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, contains many of the president’s policy and budget priorities: cutting taxes, particularly for the wealthiest Americans; boosting funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and slashing funding for health care and food assistance programs, among others. 
“We think it’s important for us to understand from a budget perspective, what the Congress has done, but more importantly, we need to prepare, and help Minnesotans prepare, for what could be a hard economic hit and a lack of stability,” Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy said Tuesday. 
The subcommittee will meet weekly beginning Sept. 18, and plans to alternate meetings in St. Paul with visits to affected communities around the state. 
The new mandates for major programs are taking effect while the supervising federal agencies are short-staffed, causing a lack of clarity and oversight for the local people charged with enforcing the new rules, said Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Burnsville, who will chair the committee. 
“We need to understand what those unanswered questions are, so that we can help to try to provide some stability moving forward, and work in partnership with the cities, the counties, the school boards, with our farmers and teachers and nurses,” Port said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced during a Tuesday press conference.
The donation is a longstanding tradition, part of National Rice Month. Sanders said the event represents supporting “all Arkansans.” She lauded farmers for making the donations despite tough market conditions that have squeezed commodity farmers.
Arkansans are paying millions more for daily necessities as a result of tariffs placed on imports by the Trump administration, according to a report from Farmers for Free Trade. Farmers could be particularly impacted by these policies because they have input costs for items like tractor parts and fertilizer that could increase even more because of tariffs.
Brian Burton, the CEO of Arkansas Food Bank, said some of the farmers who made donations last year were no longer in business due to the pressures the market has placed on the industry.
“This time that we’re living in, it’s so tumultuous and fraught with uncertainty,” Burton said. “I think about those of you who, even though you’re going through hard times, you don’t forget those who are hungry and are really struggling on the edge of our economy.”

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — A man slept on the cool, gray steps of Independence Boulevard Christian Church, the building and its columns shielding his body from the midday sun on a recent weekday. A few others lingered in the shade under nearby trees.
On Monday evenings, the more-than-century-old church in Historic Northeast Kansas City opens its doors to people in need. It offers a free meal, hygiene products, clothing and a medical clinic. Hundreds often come.
President Donald Trump’s nationwide gerrymandering push has now also arrived at the church’s literal doorstep.
Northeast Kansas City currently sits comfortably inside Missouri’s 5th Congressional District, which encompasses much of the city and the surrounding metro area. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, an 80-year-old Democrat who was the city’s first Black mayor in the 1990s, has held the seat for 20 years.
But Missouri Republicans are advancing a redrawn congressional map through the state legislature that aims to give the party a political advantage. It would crack the city’s urban core into three districts — with all of them converging on the corner of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, home to Independence Boulevard Christian Church.
The intersection’s southwest corner, where the church is located, would move into the 4th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Mark Alford, a second-term Republican who was previously a TV news anchor. The southeast corner, a parking lot, would stay in a 5th District reshaped to embrace a much more rural and conservative constituency.
The northern side, lined by red-brick apartments and a meat market, would join the 6th District. Held by Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves since 2001, it would stretch across the state to the Illinois border.
Residents say they fear that dividing the area, with its complex interplay of problems and positive qualities, will dilute their voice in Washington, D.C.

“We need somebody to understand what poverty looks like,” the Rev. Mindy Fugarino, the church’s senior pastor, told Stateline as she described her problems with the gerrymander and how it will weaken the neighborhood’s representation.
“We need somebody to understand, what are the needs for housing,” Fugarino said. “We need somebody to understand what are the needs for fair wages and health care and those kind of things in a community where people are literally living and sometimes dying on the street.”
The Missouri House passed the new map in a 90-65 vote Tuesday, sending it to the state Senate. The Senate could begin work on the map as early as Wednesday.
The Missouri gerrymander marks the latest example of a Republican-controlled state heeding Trump’s call to redraw congressional districts. Creating more GOP-leaning districts would maximize the party’s chances of retaining control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections.
Democrats, both in Missouri and across the country, have condemned the effort as election-rigging. California has retaliated by asking its voters to approve a Democratic gerrymander. Republicans say they want to ensure Congress can advance Trump’s priorities, and they emphasize that federal courts allow partisan gerrymandering.
In Kansas City, the redistricting plan has set off a bitter political battle that’s left many people feeling angry and dismissed. Stateline spoke with residents, business owners, activists and local officials in Northeast Kansas City, where three districts would divide the area, to better understand the consequences of the national gerrymandering effort at the local level.
Northeast Kansas City residents and others broadly described a diverse, multicultural community with beautiful architecture, a strong civic fabric and neighborhood pride. In the blocks immediately surrounding the intersection of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, less than a third of residents are non-Hispanic white, according to census data.
At the same time, homelessness and crime can be a part of life. Residents are balancing a need for local investment against the risks of gentrification. The poverty rate fluctuates wildly within the area, from less than 12% of residents in some blocks to more than 63% in others. Vacant storefronts are sometimes only a short walk from colorful, tidy houses.










We need somebody to understand what poverty looks like.


– The Rev. Mindy Fugarino of Independence Boulevard Christian Church in Kansas City, Mo.


Most community members Stateline spoke with oppose the redistricting effort.
“Nobody asked for this,” said Edgar Palacios, the founder of Latinx Education Collaborative and Revolución Educativa, nonprofit organizations based in Northeast Kansas City that seek to foster Latino representation in education locally. His own home would move into the 4th District under the plan.
Palacios, the son of Nicaraguan immigrants, worried the gerrymander would lead to new representatives for the area who won’t understand the challenges of an urban environment.
“They’re not going to understand the nuances of urban public education and they’re not going to appreciate the differences in how money gets spent or why it gets spent that way or why it’s necessary to do certain things,” Palacios said.
Dan Smith runs Eleos Coffee House on Independence Avenue. The 14-year-old coffee shop is a nondenominational Christian ministry that Smith said draws in both people coming to just work or hang out and individuals off the street wanting help.
Smith declined to offer an opinion on the redistricting proposal, but said he hoped politicians will “totally forget about those lines” when making decisions.
“Because that’s what we have to do here at Eleos,” Smith said. “We can’t draw lines, you know — ‘well, as long as you’re in this group of people or as long as you don’t identify this way or as long as you don’t do this’ — I mean, that’s not helpful for anybody.”
Republicans say maps are improvement
Trump set off a gerrymandering rush this summer in an effort to shore up Republican chances to keep control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
He initially demanded Texas redraw its maps to potentially provide up to five additional GOP seats, and has since urged Republicans in other states to do the same. California has retaliated and other Democratic states may follow.
As Democrats fight ‘fire with fire,’ gerrymandering opponents seek a path forward

Republicans in Missouri and elsewhere have been upfront that they are shuffling the map with the intention of improving their party’s standing and say their efforts are in line with a U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision that greenlit political gerrymandering. Missouri Republicans add that their proposed map splits fewer counties and cities than the current one.
“It is an improvement; it is a reform of our current congressional map,” Missouri state Rep. Dirk Deaton, the Republican sponsor of the legislation, said at a hearing last week in Jefferson City, the state capital.
Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who called a special session to pass the map, said the state’s “conservative, commonsense values, rooted in faith, family and freedom, should be truly represented at all levels of government.” He also wants lawmakers to pass a measure that would pose new hurdles to citizen-proposed constitutional amendments.
Kehoe’s office released only rough outlines of the map. After redistricting legislation was introduced in the Missouri General Assembly last week, Stateline produced a detailed map based on census block information supplied by the Missouri House that shows three congressional districts would meet at Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
Republicans already hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats. Cleaver is one of two Democrats, along with U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of the 1st Congressional District in St. Louis.


At most, the new map would likely enable Republicans to take the 5th Congressional District — a single seat — at the cost of a divided Kansas City.
“Two words. One is ‘horrible’ and the second is ‘divisive,’” Cleaver told reporters in Kansas City recently, summing up his reaction to the map.
Cleaver has promised to file a federal lawsuit challenging the map if it passes (other opponents are expected to file lawsuits in state court as well). Giving one example of how the gerrymander would affect the region, Cleaver said Kansas City Public Schools would have multiple U.S. representatives under the map.
“It’s conceivable that two members of Congress could be fighting each other when legislation occurs where one party takes a position and the other party takes the opposite position,” Cleaver said. “That’s absolutely crazy.”
Kansas City is home to some 516,000 people in an overall metro area of 2.2 million. The city is in the midst of a sports golden era that has been a boost to local pride: The Kansas City Chiefs have appeared in five Super Bowls over the past six years and won three; the city hosted the NFL Draft in 2023; it will host World Cup soccer matches next summer. Music star Taylor Swift’s frequent visits to the metro area to see fiancé Travis Kelce, the Chiefs player, have helped, too.
But gun violence remains a persistent problem. As other major cities have experienced falling homicide rates coming out of the pandemic, Kansas City broke its homicide record in 2023. Killings then fell last year, but nonfatal shootings jumped.
Kansas City leaders say their options to respond are constrained. Unlike nearly every major American city, Kansas City doesn’t control its police force. Instead, city-funded officers are overseen by commissioners almost entirely appointed by the governor, a policy with Civil War-era roots. And Missouri lawmakers have almost entirely preempted the city’s ability to restrict firearms.
For some Kansas Citians, the gerrymandered map strikes them as only the latest instance in a long history of Missouri exercising power with little regard for residents. The map cuts much of Kansas City into two along Troost Avenue — once a dividing line during the era of racial redlining that is still shorthand today for the split between the city’s predominantly white and Black neighborhoods.
“It’s sad that they go to this length to try, in my opinion, to disenfranchise people,” said Lonnie Beattle, a retired postal worker who said she lives in the 18th Street and Vine Street neighborhood that’s south of the Northeast Kansas City area.

Kansas City-Missouri low point
The gerrymander marks a low point in the relationship between Kansas City and the Missouri Capitol, said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
But the second-term mayor, who has battled with Republicans over control of police funding, said that in this instance, the moves by lawmakers have very little do with “purported misbehavior” by the city and more to do with Trump’s demands.
Lucas said carving up Kansas City would mean city officials would have to engage in more lobbying work and more outreach to members of Congress.
“It just adds bureaucracy to a process that currently doesn’t really need it,” Lucas said. “I think everything is working fine right now. One might ask, why change? But obviously, because the president said so.”
Missouri House passes gerrymandered congressional map, limits on initiative petitions

While nearly everyone approached by Stateline voiced opposition to the proposed map, the sentiment wasn’t unanimous.
Laura Birdsong, who lives in Northeast Kansas City and calls herself conservative, said that while she understands the concerns, she also sees positives.
“I don’t think it’s an attempt to control, I think it’s an attempt to balance,” Birdsong said as she drove an all-terrain vehicle along Independence Avenue on Friday, shuttling people to and from a local food festival.
Kate Barsotti, a longtime resident of Columbus Park, a neighborhood on the western edge of Northeast Kansas City, said she knew immediately that the gerrymander would be a threat to the neighborhood, dividing it between the 4th and 6th districts. But she suggested the decision could backfire on Republicans.
Barsotti, like others interviewed, emphasized what she views as the absurdity of a congressional district that includes Kansas City stretching all the way to the Illinois border on the eastern edge of the state. Many say that placing so many rural areas into the same district as a dense urban city could upset rural, conservative voters as well.
“So if you want to fight, you’ve just declared war on your own constituents, and I can go anywhere in the state of Missouri and say to them, ‘They don’t care about you,’” Barsotti said.
Some Democrats suspect the party could potentially flip the 4th District, currently held by a Republican, if Kehoe’s proposed map is enacted. Its current boundaries include substantial rural areas but exclude most of the Kansas City metro region. Under the new map, the 4th would slice deep into Kansas City, swallowing up downtown and a lot of Democratic voters in the process.
Lucas said if the map takes effect, he would consider running in 2026 in the 4th District, where he would live. Everyone who cares about representation for Kansas City owes it to the community to make Republicans spend real resources, he said.
“And so I expect there to be a real congressional race,” the mayor said.

At Independence Boulevard Christian Church on Monday afternoon, preparations were already underway for that evening’s meal.
Tables and chairs were set up in a large basement hall, with a separate space available for families. Fugarino, the pastor, said the church expected to serve some kind of ham-and-turkey casserole.
In a few hours, their guests would arrive.
Later that afternoon and 150 miles away at the state Capitol, lawmakers would begin debating the bill that would split apart the crossroads of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
“I think the whole point,” Fugarino said in an interview about the gerrymander, “has nothing to do with trying to address what citizens are actually needing.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Highway Patrol has revised its drug arrest numbers for a recent saturation patrol, saying it jailed fewer than half of the people its original terminology suggested.
Last week, Gov. Larry Rhoden gave South Dakota Searchlight and several other media outlets a list of arrests from the first saturation patrol conducted in Sioux Falls by his administration’s “Operation Prairie Thunder” public safety campaign.
The list included 174 arrests for drugs, 44 of which involved felony drugs. 
First state-funded ‘Prairie Thunder’ patrol results in 44 felony drug arrests in Sioux Falls

Over the weekend, however, The Dakota Scout newspaper reported that those arrest numbers did not square with the number of people who were arrested. 
The governor’s office did not dispute the newspaper’s findings, even as Rhoden told the paper he was still pleased with the results.
The Highway Patrol said it uses the words “arrest” and “citation” interchangeably, and that a single person could be cited multiple times.
The agency has done so for years, Highway Patrol spokesman Brad Reiners said in an email to South Dakota Searchlight on Monday, including in its daily “rally tally” of arrests during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
“The way they are counted fits our reporting system, but not necessarily the way the public perceives the numbers,” Reiners wrote.
According to a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the Highway Patrol said that the 174 charges reported for the three-day saturation patrol in Sioux Falls were filed against 78 people. 
Of those, 51 were booked into jail, and 27 were “arrested, cited and released with a notice to appear.”
In a statement, Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve Long said the agency “apologizes for the confusion regarding the statistical reporting,” and that in the future, Highway Patrol press releases will “accurately reflect the number of unique individuals arrested in addition to the number of total charges filed.”
“Nonetheless, the results continue to reflect the significant positive impact Operation: Prairie Thunder has to reduce criminal activity,” Long wrote.

(Getty Images)Three state Supreme Court justices offered a glimpse behind their chambers doors Monday as they seek voters’ approval in November to serve second terms.
Judges in Pennsylvania are elected to 10-year terms in partisan elections. Once in office, however, they stand for retention in “yes” or “no” referenda to serve subsequent terms.
Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht were elected as Democrats in 2015 in a historic race where three of the seven Supreme Court seats were up for grabs for the first time in the court’s 300-year history.
This year, the same trio of justices are up for retention. In a “fireside chat” led by WHYY-FM’s Cherri Gregg, Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht spoke about judicial independence, the court’s deliberative process and and to dispel the idea that their decisions are politically driven.
The event was co-sponsored by the court access group Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, the government watchdog Committee of Seventy and the Pennsylvania League of Women Voters.
In the last decade the Supreme Court has issued pivotal opinions allowing school districts to sue the governor and General Assembly over the state’s education funding system, allowing mail ballots with inconsequential flaws to be counted and upheld state emergency orders closing businesses to slow the spread of COVID-19.
“The independence of the judiciary is an amazing piece of our Pennsylvania Constitution,” Dougherty said. “It’s a sacred part of our constitution that, for some reason, people believe should just be a suggestion.”
As the third branch of government, the judiciary provides a check and balance on the legislative and executive branches to ensure that neither abuses its authority, Dougherty noted. Wecht added its roles include interpreting the state constitution, which defines and limits the powers of the other two branches.

“The constitution is the fundamental law and is superior to a legislative enactment. So there are times when the court must stand against the popular will … So it’s not for the faint hearted,” Wecht said.
And Donohue said the court often delves into the English and colonial law that preceded the state constitution to determine what its authors intended.
“For many years, the Supreme Court did not spend a whole lot of time on Pennsylvania constitutional rights, and it is, needless to say, one of the most important things that we do,” she said.
The unprecedented 2015 election flipped the court to a 5-2 majority of justices who were elected as Democrats. Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht joined now-Chief Justice Debra Todd and then-Chief Justice Max Baer.
Justice Daniel McCaffrey’s election as a Democrat in 2023, maintained the majority despite outside spending by conservatives attacking him. With more than $19.5 million spent by McCaffery, his Republican opponent, Montgomery County Judge Carolyn Carluccio, and third parties, the election shattered the previous record in 2015.
This year, according to Meta and Google, the Republican State Leadership Committee has already spent at least $91,000 on digital ads urging Republicans to vote by mail to defeat “radical liberal judges … trying to secure another decade of power.”
Gregg asked the justices how they ensure that their rulings are not political and are grounded in the law and constitution. 
Donohue replied that the courts are required to follow rules to interpret the law and ascertain the intent of lawmakers, sometimes decades or centuries after a law was enacted. In interpreting the constitution, the courts look at how its provisions have been applied through history and how earlier laws might have informed its framers.
“Our personal views, our political views, our religious views, are left on the wayside. They have absolutely nothing to do with the manner in which we can decide cases, and do decide cases,” Donohue said.
Dougherty said that’s borne out in the 10 years of decisions each justice has authored and voted on, noting that they have taken stances that could be considered adverse to political or ideological labels. 
“The constitution required us to run as a partisan, but the moment we were elected, when we put that black robe on, we hung up that partisan title,” he said.

Wecht added that the seven justices never think of a Democratic or a Republican outcome in a case. Rather, they apply the law as they interpret it, following predictable rules.
“We have no choice but to apply the law that the legislature has given us, and any one of us, or all of us, or some mix of us may think the result stinks, but it’s not our business to decide whether we like the result or not,” Wecht said.
In many cases, the court is bound by the doctrine of stare decisis, the Latin phrase meaning “to stand by things decided,” which requires judges to look at how the law has developed over time and follow earlier decisions.
Wecht was the subject of a state lawmaker’s call to impeach him in 2020 amid allegations that he had overstepped the court’s authority by legislating from the bench. Former Rep. Frank Ryan (R-Lebanon) cited Wecht’s 2018 decision on congressional redistricting and upholding former Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-19 emergency orders in 2020.
Gregg asked Wecht what he learned from the redistricting case. Calling the Republican-controlled legislature’s map “flamboyantly gerrymandered” and “grossly improper,” Wecht said he found out the people behind such an impropriety are going to be “very upset” when a court strikes it down.
“It’s a fundamental principle in our system that if one seeks to recuse a jurist, one makes a motion in advance of the proceeding, one doesn’t wait for the result to see if one likes the result, and then complain that maybe that person shouldn’t have participated,” he said.
Describing the court’s day-to-day work, Dougherty said the court is unique in the commonwealth because it decides what cases it wants to hear, and it accepts only 5% to 8% of the requests that come before it. There are exceptions such as death penalty cases and Gaming Act appeals that the court must hear.
Each justice reviews about 300 requests a year and author memoranda recommending whether to accept or deny them.  Their colleagues don’t always agree, so there are often responses before a decision whether to consider a case is finally made, Dougherty said. 
Meanwhile, the justices must review case files for the cases they have agreed to consider and write opinions for those they have heard. That’s on top of the administrative tasks of attorney discipline or appointing people to serve on committees that draft court rules and procedures. 
“So each day, every day, it’s a product of intellectual jumping jacks, and each chamber permits itself to determine what it finds to be the priority at that particular moment,” Dougherty said.
Audio from the court’s oral arguments, where attorneys for each side present their cases, are broadcast on the Pennsylvania Cable Network (PCN) and on the court’s YouTube channel. Donohue said those arguments give listeners, including the justices themselves, a strong indication of what each justice is thinking about a case.
Immediately after arguments, the justices have an administrative session behind closed doors where they take preliminary votes on the cases they have just heard. Sometimes the justices discuss the case to narrow the issues on which they will focus. 
Each case is assigned to a justice to author a preliminary majority opinion that is circulated among his or her colleagues. Then, any dissenting opinions are drafted and the majority responds, Donohue said.
“That’s where the debate happens,” she said, adding that sometimes there are discussions between the justices to fine tune the majority ruling to accommodate disagreements on fine points of law and in others individual justices write concurring opinions in which they explain how they would have decided the case differently to reach the same result as the majority.
“Votes can change. Alterations can happen in opinions. And really, the public sees the tip of the iceberg,” Wecht said. “Maybe a better metaphor than an iceberg, is a water polo game where you see the ball up here, but you don’t see the kicking and gouging going on underneath the surface.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-09 20:27:04+00:00,CT Mirror,Feds recommend performance improvement plan for CT DCF,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/09/federal-report-ct-dcf-children/,"In the latest Child and Family Services Reviews, Connecticut missed federal benchmarks in five of seven factors HHS reviewed.","Connecticut’s child welfare system isn’t hitting federal markers for success, particularly in areas related to ensuring children’s safety, access to services for families and finding a permanent place for foster children to live, according to a new federal report.
The report, from a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services focused on children, found that Connecticut was not in “substantial conformity” with any of the outcome measurements for foster kids’ well-being that the federal government examines regularly. The state was only in conformity with two of seven factors the federal government reviewed.
“We have a very serious problem in terms of being unable to meet the needs of the most vulnerable children in our state,” said Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy.
Many of the problems addressed in the report were tied to a lack of resources, Eagan said. She questioned whether DCF has been seeking enough funding from the state.
HHS conducts regular audits of states’ child welfare agencies, including the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. This latest report, known as the Child and Family Services Reviews, or CFSR, was based on information gathered from July 2024 to March 2025.
The agency also found that Connecticut does well at placing siblings together, relocating kids removed from their homes into relatives’ homes, meeting the educational needs of children in foster care, and assessing kids’ needs.
Still, the report concluded that Connecticut should be placed on a performance improvement plan until the state makes progress toward meeting federal markers. It’s difficult to meet those markers, which have high standards. Most states missed markers in their audits.
“The CFSR sends a clear message that Connecticut has a lot of work to do to improve outcomes for children and families served by the Department,” said Christina Ghio, the state’s acting child advocate, in a statement.
Ghio said the Office of the Child Advocate is primarily concerned with inconsistent safety practices, lack of mental health services, permanent stability for children in foster care and delays in reunifications.
Interim DCF Commissioner Susan Hamilton said in a statement that her department has successfully completed performance improvement plans in the past, adding, “one will be submitted in the near future in collaboration with other system partners to address the highlighted areas consistent with all states across the country.” She said the state’s child welfare system “remains committed to continuous learning and reform to strengthen outcomes for the children and families we collectively serve.”
Hamilton went on to note that the CFSR had highlighted some of Connecticut’s strengths, “such as kinship care, sibling placements, thorough behavioral health assessments, and strong community engagement— which are a direct reflection of our core values of family-centered practice, partnership, and a robust Quality Assurance System that drives continuous improvement.” She said the department had already “identified areas of focus to enhance our work.”
The report’s findings
The federal analysts found that DCF workers weren’t consistent with their safety-related practices, especially with in-home services. In-person contacts with children involved in investigations weren’t always timely, and there weren’t adequate services provided for homes with risk factors such as domestic violence or substance abuse.
The agency also had limited ability to meet behavioral health needs, the report said.
The federal auditors conducted interviews with people involved in the system who said there were problems with long waitlists, a limited workforce and transportation availability to and from service providers.
Eagan said inadequate funding has affected access to many aspects of the state’s social safety net. Providers of those services say the problem stems, in part, from the state’s adherence to a slate of “fiscal guardrails,” which have constrained what they see as necessary state spending. 
“None of these agencies are operating with enough funds to serve the people that depend on them,” Eagan said. “And that’s a big part of this here.”
Ghio said many of the problems mentioned in the report have also come up in investigations her office conducts. “The state must work to develop an adequate service array to ensure that families receive the services they need, both to prevent removal and support reunification whenever removal is necessary,” she said in a statement.
Connecticut also had challenges with finding permanent places for children in foster care to live, whether the goal was adoption or reunification with their parents. Those plans weren’t enacted as quickly as the federal government wanted, which is typically within 15 months.
Some of this was due to delays in court, either because of the time it took DCF to provide paperwork, or due to rescheduled hearings or judge availability, the report said.
“The ‘delays’ are much more complicated than how it is written and captured in the report,” Judge Tammy Nguyen-O’Dowd, chief administrative judge of juvenile matters, said in a statement.
Nguyen-O’Dowd said many people, including at least four attorneys, have to coordinate on court dates and that the number of attorneys working on juvenile matters with the Office of the Chief Public Defender is limited. She also said that DCF makes decisions on when to file petitions for the termination of parental rights.
The rate of children being mistreated in foster care also increased between fiscal years 2020 and 2022. The rate of maltreatment victims aged 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 doubled, and those ages 11 to 16 increased fivefold, according to the report.
“With regard to placement stability, there is no question that moving from place to place is harmful to children,” Ghio, the acting child advocate, said. “While Connecticut may still be within the national performance expectation, we are trending in the wrong direction. We do not have enough foster homes to meet the need.”
The federal agency also reported issues with access to services, particularly for biological families and fathers. The report said it was a “significant area of concern,” to ensure that “parents have enhanced capacity to provide for their children.”
The report also said DCF has a good quality assurance system and does good work planning for multiple goals for children and families.
Advocates said the results of this study and other reports such as a recent audit about kids missing from care and OCA reports are worthy of attention.
“That’s the core problem that we’re dealing with in this state is an ever-eroding capacity to meet the needs of vulnerable people, and nobody pays the price worse for that than children,” Eagan said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3936-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 16:57:32.829844

Article Summary

Justice P. Scott Neville Jr. was elected by his colleagues to become the state’s next chief justice, beginning in October.
Chief justices in Illinois are elected by their colleagues to serve three-year terms.
Neville has served on the court since 2018 and will become the state’s second Black chief justice. The first was his predecessor on the court, Justice Charles Freeman.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Supreme Court announced Tuesday that Justice P. Scott Neville Jr. has been chosen to be the state’s 123rd chief justice, succeeding Mary Jane Theis, whose three-year term as head of the court expires Oct. 26.
Theis, who was named chief justice in 2022, will remain on the court as an associate justice.
Neville, 76, has served on the court since 2018 when he was appointed to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Charles Freeman. He was elected to a 10-year term in 2020. He previously served as an appellate court justice and as a Cook County circuit court judge.
According to a release from the court, Neville began his legal career as the first Black law clerk for a Cook County appellate justice. Later, he practiced civil law and appellate law, which included helping prosecute a lawsuit over the 1992 redistricting of Chicago’s 50 wards.
Neville received a bachelor of arts degree from Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Missouri, and a juris doctorate from Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.
In a statement, Neville said public trust in the courts “requires justice that is accessible, procedures that are understandable, and support services that meet the needs of litigants.”
“I will always work to make the Illinois courts a national model, safeguarding the constitutional promise of equal justice without regard to who a person is, where they live, or what resources they have so all litigants are seen and heard,” he said.
The Illinois Supreme Court is composed of seven justices who are elected by districts in partisan races. Under the Illinois Constitution, three justices are chosen from Cook County and the other four are elected from downstate in districts that are drawn by the General Assembly and are supposed to be roughly equal in population.
The justices elect a chief justice to a three-year term from within their own ranks. The post typically goes to the most senior justice who has not already served a term as chief justice.
Neville will become the state’s second Black chief justice after Freeman, who held the post from 1997 to 2000.
The chief justice’s duties include overseeing the administration of Illinois courts and more than 900 judges, supervising appointments to Supreme Court committees, leading the Illinois Judicial Conference and presenting the court’s annual budget to the General Assembly.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds has returned to India with a delegation from Iowa this week, following up from trade discussions that began during her first visit in 2024.
Reynolds had first visited India with Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, Iowa Economic Development Authority and Iowa Finance Authority Director Debi Durham and Iowa agricultural and business leaders, for a 10-day mission in September 2024. She and other state leaders discussed trade opportunities with business and government leaders between Iowa and India in areas like biofuel, commodity crops and agricultural technology.
The governor is joined by many of the same Iowans, including Naig and Durham, on this year’s trip, which kicked off Sept. 6. The eight-day trip includes visits to Delhi, Pune, and Mumbai.
In a news release, the governor’s office stated the purpose of the trip is to “build on relationships established during an initial visit a year ago and to further explore growth opportunities with one of the world’s largest emerging economies.”
“Our visit to India last year kicked off a number of relationships between Iowa and Indian businesses and trade associations and furthered conversations on investing in Iowa and market access for certain Iowa agricultural products,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I look forward to further solidifying those relationships and establishing new connections on which to build.”
Reynolds and Naig gave remarks Monday at DialogueNEXT, a symposium hosted by the World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines. At the event, Reynolds told attendees that Iowa farmers “produce 10 percent of America’s food supply with less than 1 percent of its population” — and that the state is a center for innovation in both agriculture and energy production.
“From precision agriculture and biotechnology to renewable fuels and soil conservation, we are constantly working to improve yields, protect the environment, and make food systems more sustainable,” Reynolds said in her keynote address. “And we recognize that food security is inseparable from energy security. Iowa leads America in renewable fuels production. Ethanol and biodiesel provide affordable, clean energy that supports farmers while helping countries like India diversify their energy sources and reduce emissions.”
Reynolds said India plays a vital role in building food and energy security, saying “by combining Iowa’s agricultural innovation with India’s scale, talent, and growing market, we can create new pathways to feed the world.”
The governor also met with the Sehgal Foundation, an Indian nongovernmental organization focused on sustainable agricultural practices.
The trip, organized by IEDA with support from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi and Consulate in Mumbai, includes roundtable discussions with the U.S.-India Business Council, the U.S. Soybean Export Council and the U.S. Grains Council later this week. Reynolds is also scheduled to attend a partner state signing ceremony Friday between Iowa and Maharashtra, a western state of India that contains the cities of Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune.
The India visit is one of several international trade missions Reynolds has joined in recent years, as the governor has stated that Iowa should focus on expanding their influence through new global markets. She has also led a trade mission to Italy, Kosovo and Israel in 2023.
The trade mission comes amid heightened U.S. tariffs on goods from India. The tariffs of 50% on goods from India was implemented in late August, as President Donald Trump sought to take action to penalize. the country for its purchase of Russian oil and weapons during the Russia-Ukraine war.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reynolds-india-trade-2024-_-cami-koons-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-09 16:57:32.829844

Robert Anderson, Maria Hernandez and Silvia Ramos — all of whom are charged with mishandling voters’ absentee ballots — took turns entering their pleas in Bridgeport Superior Court and were ordered to return to court in November for their next hearing.
Elsie Mercado, who faces similar charges, is scheduled to enter a plea on Sept. 25. 
The four political operatives are the latest people to be charged with mishandling absentee ballots in Bridgeport, Connecticut’s largest city, during the city’s two most recent mayoral elections.

Their criminal cases will now be managed alongside the charges leveled against six other Bridgeport political players, including several current and former city council members and the vice chairwoman of Bridgeport Democratic party.
During the hearing on Tuesday, the judge listened to the various defense attorneys discuss whether they’ve received all of the evidence compiled against their clients as part of the sprawling criminal investigation. 
Most of the cases were reset for another hearing on Nov. 4.

But Jazmarie Melendez, one of the defendants accused of violating the state’s absentee ballot laws, told the judge that she would not be entertaining any plea offers from prosecutors and planned to proceed to a jury trial. 
Melendez, who stepped down the from the Bridgeport city council earlier this year, has been accused by prosecutors of misrepresenting the requirements to vote via absentee ballot.

Her defense attorney, Alex Taubes, told the judge that his client would not be seeking a deal with prosecutors because his client did not violate the law.
The judge asked Melendez whether she was aware of the consequences of the jury trial if she is found guilty of the charges against her. And Melendez said she understood the consequences. 
It’s unclear how quickly the jury trial in Melendez’s case could be set. 
Seven other Bridgeport political operatives — including several members of the city council and the vice chairwoman of the Bridgeport Democratic Party — were previously charged with absentee ballot crimes in connection with 2019 and 2023 Democratic primaries.
The city made national news in the fall of 2023 after surveillance footage emerged showing numerous political operatives allegedly stuffing ballots into four different drop boxes located throughout the city.

But Councilman Tim Sapp, the lone dissenting vote, told the Powell Tribune he’s concerned about increasing density and doesn’t believe the change is needed. Read the full story.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)A federal appeals court has ruled that the state of Wisconsin and businesses operating in certain parts of southeastern Wisconsin will not be required to meet more stringent air quality standards for ozone pollution — giving state regulators and industry a reprieve from what they say were “costly and burdensome requirements.”
On Friday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the state’s request to temporarily postpone a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Late last year, the EPA reclassified areas of Milwaukee, Kenosha and Sheboygan counties as being in “serious nonattainment” of the agency’s 2015 ozone standards. In February, the state filed a lawsuit for the review of the EPA finding. 
The enforcement of the EPA standard would have forced the state to revise its plan for complying with national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, and hundreds of businesses would have had to assess if their existing permits need to be renewed or revised. The state complained that these measures would have cost the Department of Natural Resources and the state’s businesses millions of dollars when most of the ozone pollution over the areas is caused elsewhere and settles over southeast Wisconsin after drifting across Lake Michigan. 
Environmental groups have said that even if Wisconsin’s industries aren’t creating most of the ozone pollution, the businesses have a duty to work to protect the health and well-being of the state’s residents. In 2018, Clean Wisconsin sued the EPA to force the agency to declare the three southeastern Wisconsin counties aren’t complying with federal air quality rules. 
Ozone pollution, also known as smog, occurs most often in the summer when air pollution from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes reacts with sunlight. The pollution can be harmful to people’s respiratory systems. 
“The fact that southeastern Wisconsin has been reclassified as in serious nonattainment for ozone means that residents of those counties are at higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and Wisconsin should be implementing all possible policies and strategies to reduce ozone pollution to protect public health,” Clean Wisconsin attorney Katie Nekola said in a statement to Wisconsin Public Radio. 
But business groups and the state have argued the costs are too high for a problem that doesn’t start in Wisconsin. DNR analysis has found that less than 10% of the ozone pollution in the state is caused by Wisconsin industry. 
The state Department of Justice said in its lawsuit that the “change triggers costly permit requirements, complex regulations, and stringent emissions offset mandates,” which could create $4 million in added costs for the state and cost an estimated 382 businesses between $1 million and $6.9 million.
Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said the court’s Friday order grants relief from the “crushing and job-killing ozone regulations.” 
“Data from both the DNR and EPA indicate that the vast majority of ozone pollution in eastern Wisconsin is caused by emissions originating from outside our state borders,” Manley said in a statement. “It’s unfair to punish Wisconsin businesses for pollution they didn’t create, and [the] order is the first step toward righting this wrong.”

(Photo by Lue Palmer/Verite News)Extended heatwaves in New Orleans have been tied to spikes in domestic violence-related calls, according to a new, robust peer-reviewed study.
Dangerously hot days are on the rise as the climate changes due to human-caused global warming. This year, New Orleans has faced 20 heat advisories and three extreme heat warnings, according to the National Weather Service. Published Aug. 29 in JAMA Network Open, the research found that the longer residents experience extreme heat, the more likely the weather could turn into a trigger for violence between intimate partners.
Projections show lengthy heatwaves will occur even more frequently in the coming decades, potentially exacerbating the city’s existing problems with domestic violence. The study’s authors said they believe the study shows the city should integrate its heat-mitigation strategies with its efforts to limit violence, especially between partners.
“A lot of people know alcohol can be a trigger. This research lets people know heat can be a trigger. It’s not an excuse, there’s never an excuse for domestic violence. But this could be one of those things to elevate your risk,” said Newcomb Institute executive director Anita Raj, whose institute helped conduct the research.

The study reviewed more than 150,000 calls to the New Orleans Police Department related to domestic violence from 2011 to 2021, matching the daily call volume to the weather conditions in each zip code.
Emergency calls related to domestic violence were 4% more likely when the average temperature stayed above 86 degrees for at least five days. At even hotter temperatures, the odds worsened.
“What we find is that a prolonged exposure appears to have a cumulative effect on stress and intrusive behavior,” said the study’s lead author, Arnab Dey, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. “So our theory is that a single hot day might be more manageable, but when people experience multiple consecutive days of extreme heat, especially without adequate cooling, the physiological and the psychological stress would build up.”
The study estimated that about 245 domestic violence-related calls may have been avoided if not for the heat. Raj and Dey noted that their police data likely significantly underestimates the number of incidents as people often call 911 in the most severe cases.
“It’s likely just the tip of the iceberg,” Raj said.
‘Heat in particular does create agitation’
Dey and Raj said they hope, given the early warnings available for extreme heat, public officials can help raise the public’s awareness of this connection by including domestic violence as one of the risks during a heatwave. In New Orleans, heatwaves lasting at least three days could be 85% more likely in 30 years, according to an analysis by the First Street Foundation.
“Heat in particular does create agitation, and, for some, that agitation can move towards aggression,” Raj said. “
Other studies have documented how gun violence also becomes more likely when it’s hot outside. Research linking aggression to heat also goes back decades. Raj said she would like to see reminders to the public about the psychological effect of heat and messages like: “Stay cool in body, stay cool in mind.”
Raj said the research will be shared with advocates for domestic violence survivors and prevention, as well as city officials, to help shape their work.
Eva Lessinger is the co-director of Beyond Harm, an advocacy group that provides intervention services to stop the cycle of domestic violence outside of the criminal justice system. She said this type of information can help to mitigate domestic violence but stressed that heat, or other factors like alcohol use, does not cause domestic violence.
“There’s so many things that can exacerbate an already violent situation,” Lessinger said, noting alcohol, mental illness, stress and poverty on top of heat. “But I don’t think anything really causes domestic violence except the person who is using the violence. … A pattern of control over your partner isn’t going anywhere, even during the winter.”
Lessinger said there’s still controversy over what exactly causes domestic violence, but one theory is that it relies on a person creating a belief system that allows them to justify the abuse of another due to their life experiences. Disrupting and changing those beliefs can require intervention programs involving tactics like accountability groups, therapy and case management, like Beyond Harm’s offers.
While understanding the link between heat and domestic violence won’t solve the epidemic, Lessinger said she agreed with the importance of taking a holistic approach to how human behavior can be affected by climate.
Raj said he hopes to see more research examining the relationship between climate hazards and public health as extreme heat grows more intense, frequent and longer. Humid heat is especially concerning because it’s known to affect the body more severely, yet much is still unknown about how the rapid changes are affecting human well-being.
“With that increased intensity, the problem becomes more serious,” Raj said. “It behooves us to act very fast and use all the knowledge that we have to address these problems that are coming.”

With just days until the legislative session wraps, California’s top Democrats are discussing a series of climate, energy and transit measures in backrooms. Details are so scant that even veteran lobbyists and advocates say they are confused and frustrated.


California’s top Democrats entered the final stretch of the legislative session with an ambitious list of priorities: Pass some of the state’s most consequential climate and energy reforms, hash out a $750 million transit loan, and dampen the impact of federal funding slashes.
But with days left, details are murky on nearly all of it.
Welcome to one of the most secretive yet commonplace practices in Sacramento, where each year, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and their staff meet in private to reach last-minute agreements on major policy changes and funding allocations before the clock runs out. 
Those deals — often unveiled at the 11th hour — will likely become law as is, because there is little to no room for changes by the time they are announced. And there’s rarely any appetite or momentum among the Democratic supermajority to tinker with the final product of the top Democrats’ negotiations. 
This year, as talks stall, the future of California’s environmental policies hangs in the balance. Still up in the air are proposals to reauthorize cap and trade, the state’s signature climate program that charges polluters to emit greenhouse gas, until 2045; create a regional electricity market with other western states; replenish the state’s wildfire funds and boost in-state oil production. 
To accomplish that before session ends on Friday, lawmakers must finalize the language of those proposals and put it in print by early Wednesday morning, as required by a 2016 voter-approved law designed to give the public at least 72 hours to review bills before they are voted on. 
But the leaders had announced no deals by Monday and released no details about the talks on any of the environmental issues. Frustrated, some lobbyists and advocates turned to leaked draft language by news outlets for information. The down-to-the-wire dealmaking drew fierce opposition from trade groups and environmental justice advocates alike, who urged lawmakers to avoid a hasty deal.
Details on state lawmakers’ other policy reforms — introduced as “budget trailer bills” that govern how state funds are spent — just started to roll out early Tuesday morning. And the fate of the transit funding, which advocates say would keep the Bay Area’s transit systems from collapsing, remains obscure as talks continue. 
No one from the governor’s office or the legislative leaders’ offices responded to CalMatters’ questions about the private negotiations by press time.
‘The way our system works’
The secretive process is par for the course, but it’s notable that so many of the most consequential issues are still unknown. 
Former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat running to be the state superintendent of public instruction, said withholding details of negotiated deals until the last minute raises their chances of passing by allowing lobbyists less time to object and lawmakers less time to mull over their votes.
“A kicker is about to kick a game-winning field goal and you call a timeout to make them nervous. The longer things go on, the more nervous people get,” he said. 
“Is that the best thing to do? Is that the most democratic thing to do? No. That’s the way our system works.”
Transparency advocates argue the public should have more, not less, time to review and weigh in on legislative proposals before they become law.
“If we are pushing things ‘til the very end of session, and there is no meaningful opportunity for the public to engage, then you are putting reporters and the public in a position of getting to digest what the new law is, instead of being able to … at least let their concerns be heard,” said Brittney Barsotti, a lobbyist for the California News Publishers Association.
Some lobbyists bemoaned the lack of transparency, arguing the uncertainty made their jobs more difficult. 
“It’s hard to know sometimes what we are advocating (for) because so many of the details have yet to be released,” said Victoria Rome, a longtime lobbyist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports the reauthorization of cap and trade and a regional electricity market. 
“We’re kind of just waiting and hoping that it’s something that we can support,” she said. “(It’s) like, are we needed at all?”
“Is that the best thing to do? Is that the most democratic thing to do? No. That’s the way our system works.” former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon
The looming uncertainty is already undermining Democratic leaders’ climate agenda. Jodie Muller, chief executive of the powerful oil industry lobbying group Western States Petroleum Association, criticized lawmakers for not releasing any bill language on cap and trade despite months of conversations. The organization joined other lobbying juggernauts on Monday to oppose the reauthorization of the program.
“To be rushing something through is the wrong approach,” Muller told CalMatters. “No deal is going to be better than a bad deal.”
Governing by trailer bills
While the fate of climate policies remains elusive, lawmakers on Monday night began rolling out a series of budget trailer bills. Those measures allow lawmakers to pass last-minute laws without going through the monthslong public hearing process, and have become vehicles for both major reforms and pet projects for lawmakers in recent years.
The governor and legislative leaders have increasingly used the budget process and trailer bills to swiftly enact laws. Earlier this year, a sweeping proposal to uproot California’s landmark environmental law to make way for urban residential development was tucked into a budget trailer bill, Rome noted. 
“It just makes it even harder for advocates and the public to track what’s going on,” she said.

One trailer bill this week seeks to address the impact of federal funding cuts to Medicaid under President Donald Trump, which Newsom and state officials estimated could cost the state $28.4 billion. The bill, details of which were published Tuesday morning, would provide funding for abortion services, exempt more undocumented immigrants from paying monthly Medi-Cal premiums and establish the state’s own vaccine guidance as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention restricts COVID-19 vaccine eligibility. 
Another trailer bill on land use, released late Monday night, includes language that critics say is narrowly tailored to kill a controversial apartment complex project in Santa Barbara. The bill would apply environmental regulations now exempted for most urban developments to projects that meet a whole set of narrowly defined criteria on population, location and acreage. 
The only project to meet all the criteria is a proposed 270-unit apartment building in Santa Barbara, where newly elected Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón resides, said housing advocate Jordan Grimes.
“Is the incoming leader of the California senate sneakily trying to kill” the project? Grimes asked. “It certainly seems like it!”
In a statement Tuesday, Limón denied the accusation, calling the legislation a “cleanup bill” requiring environmental reviews when a development poses a risk to safety, rather than a specific carve-out to block one project. She did not immediately point to other projects that also fit the bill.
Transit funding flip-flop
In the Bay Area, transit advocates are experiencing a rollercoaster ride amid the on-again, off-again backroom negotiations over a $750 million loan to tide over Bay Area’s regional transit net, as transit operators warn of service cuts.
While the loan was included in a June budget agreement, Newsom and Bay Area lawmakers tussled over the loan terms. Last Friday, Newsom’s Department of Finance alerted Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who’s pushed for transit funding for years, that the deal would not be finalized. Yet on Monday, following a weekend of calls from San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and union workers, Newsom said he looks forward to striking a deal in the fall. 
But it is unclear why Newsom changed his mind and when a deal might be reached. Both Newsom and Wiener declined to elaborate on their differences or how a deal would be implemented after the Legislature leaves Sacramento this Friday. 
“We don’t have an agreement with the administration, so there’s nothing to disclose,” Wiener told CalMatters. “Once there’s an agreement, that’ll be completely public and transparent.”
The flip-flop left some Democrats frustrated. 
“I expect better of Democratic leaders,” said Matt Dorsey, a Democrat and District 6 Supervisor of San Francisco. “I would expect chaos and uncertainty from the Republicans in Washington — but with the eyes of America on our city and our state, let’s show them how Democrats can govern equitably so that we’ve got transit and paratransit and all the economic opportunities.”

Sept. 9, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceSkyrocketing energy prices, poor service, unfair outage compensation, out-of-control pay for utility executives and their perceived outsized influence on Michigan politics would be addressed in a legislative package to be introduced soon by Democrats in the House and Senate.
A coalition of advocates and lawmakers behind the bills held a news conference on Tuesday to discuss the legislation, and the need for a Michigan ratepayers’ “bill of rights.”
The legislation would protect utility customers in Michigan from policies that allow the state’s utilities – DTE Energy Company and Consumers Energy – to prioritize people over profits. It also stands to face a tough road ahead, as it’s unclear how the Republican-controlled House of Representatives might view the policies.
Even if the package is produced in the Senate and passes muster with the Democrats in control of the chamber, the package could meet a tough landing in the House before it reaches Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s desk.
A message seeking comment from the House Republican caucus on the legislation was not returned at the time of publication.
State Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) said the bill of rights being crafted by Democrats in the House and Senate is long overdue. First and foremost, McKinney said the legislation would guarantee Michiganders have the right to fair compensation when power goes out for long periods of time, including renters.
“Other states have done this. So can Michigan,” McKinney said. “We’re going to start tying any rate increases to the performance of the utility companies. You know, that novel concept in this country that you have to do a good job to get paid. It’s called performance-based rate making, and it’s being done in other places. This rate payer Bill of Rights also cracks down on utility companies that make everyday households pay for the perks of millionaire utility executives with auto control salaries.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The proposed bill of rights would also ensure residents no longer pay the highest energy costs in the Midwest; protect residents from paying for CEO bonuses and other luxuries; ban political contributions to state lawmakers from the utilities; and ensure residents can generate their own reliable energy through solar arrays on their homes or with their neighbors.
Katie Carey, a spokesperson for Consumers Energy, told Michigan Advance in a statement that the company’s rates are used to invest in the natural gas or electric system, and that delivers reliable and affordable energy to their customers. 

“Specifically for the electric side of the business, our Reliability Roadmap has delivered meaningful results in 2024 to customers, including a 12% reduction in the amount of time an average customer went without power,” Carey said. “We have mapped out the strategy and tactics that should continue leading to fewer and shorter power outages and hope other stakeholders will work with us to help us serve Michigan.”
A message seeking comment from DTE was not returned at the time of publication.
Still, Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township), said Michigan residents are faced with prices going up on all manner of goods and services, and that’s forced some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens to make choices on whether to pay for other things instead of their utility bills. If they can’t pay, Shink said those services would be cut off by the provider, which could be detrimental during days of high heat in the summer or trembling cold in the winter months.
The biggest hurdle is out of control energy costs, Shink added.
“Michiganders are watching with dismay as the two utilities file for another $1 billion rate hike. The outrageous thing is that DTE submitted this latest rate hike just a couple months after receiving a $217 million increase on all of us, and not even two years before that, they fought for a $368 million rate hike,” Shink said. “Now they’re asking to increase our rate by another 11%.”
Nessel seeks to slash DTE half-billion-dollar rate hike request by 75%

Shink said that DTE shareholders were paid $835 million in 2024 and maintained some of the worst utility service in the nation.
“Meanwhile, DTE’s CEO last year made $12.8 million. That’s a 23% increase over his salary the year before,” Shinki said. “I want to break that down just a little bit. At $12.8 million a year, that’s $213,000 a month. That’s $46,900 a day. That’s almost two times the salary of a minimum wage earner per year in a day. … That’s just wrong.”
Shink and other legislators attending the news conference said their response to a broken system was a new bill of rights to balance the scales.
“It’s the antidote to how we address energy affordability issues and bring prices down in Michigan. It’s how we restore trust with our constituents who want to know that policy makers are setting energy policy, not utility CEOs and their lobbyists,” Shink said. “Things have gotten so bad that residents in my district, in Ann Arbor, announced recently that they are launching a local ballot initiative to establish our own municipal power system in order to cut ties with DTE altogether.”

Michigan remains at the bottom in the nation for electric reliability and has some of the highest rates.
McKinney said that was because the utilities have not invested enough into bolstering the state’s grid despite the large sums of money those companies rake in.
“The neglect over years has been so detrimental that in testimony, DTE, I believe, had said that they have power lines in operation from the early 1900s still in operation today,” McKinney said. “No wonder the power keeps going out when there’s just a little bit of wind and the sun is out like today. People are fed up.”
Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) added that the grid was in such dire shape because utilities have “pocketed the profits rather than investing in people.”
“Now they’re asking us to pay for them to actually do their job and provide reliable power,” Morgan said. “I think the ultimate cause of that is the money that they have contributed in our political system. That has had a significant role in legislators over the last several decades, now holding them accountable to the people.”
As to whether Republicans in the House will support the measures, McKinney told reporters at the news conference that issue of high utility rates with lackluster service affects every Michigander, regardless of the political affiliation.

“Every single Michigan out there, we’re hearing your voice, no matter if you’re Democrat, Republican, independent, it doesn’t matter,” McKinney said. “I’m getting calls every single day about this issue. I got Republicans who hate my guts, but they’re like, ‘Hey, we’re with you on this issue.’”
A separate ballot proposal being shopped by Michiganders for Money Out of Politics also seeks to address the influence utilities have in state politics. The proposal would ban political contributions from the companies, which are considered regulated monopolies.
The Michigan Board of State Canvassers approved the proposal for signature collection in August.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission heard public feedback Tuesday on the possibility of changing state ethics rules to limit lobbyists’ influence on the lawmaking process.  
But before the public had their say, ethics commission chair Lauren E. Jones wanted to correct the public record.
“The press has had this wrong,” Jones began. “We have not proposed to change any rule. We have proposed to consider whether to change the rules. The fact that this is set up for a public hearing today does not mean at all that this commission has made any decision on any of the proposed amendments to rules and regulations.” 
The potential changes are twofold: One proposed by lawmakers would increase the permissible amount of individual gifts to public officials from $25 to $50 and from $75 to $150 annually in aggregate. The other, proposed by Common Cause Rhode Island, would broaden the definition of “interested person” to explicitly cover lobbyists and their employers, filling a gap that lets public officials and employees accept potentially unlimited freebies from these parties.
Tuesday’s meeting agenda explains that while the so-called gift rule “has historically been understood to include gifts from lobbyists to the public officials they lobby, lobbyists for not-for-profit entities may not fit neatly into this definition.”
Common Cause Rhode Island first petitioned for a rule change late last December. In May, the commission voted to start the rulemaking process. 
“There is not, as we sit here right now, a predilection to either side,” Jones said. “That has not been discussed by our commission at all.”
Part of the process involves public feedback, which Jones entertained to the fullest extent. At the start of the meeting, the commission’s executive director, Jason Gramitt, suggested the chair might impose a time limit on commentary, but Jones avoided any explicit restraints and asked people to simply be “aware” and “respectful” of the time they used for comment. 
The commission also OK’d moving public comment ahead of the day’s executive session, so that people could contribute sooner. Across roughly a half-hour, six people — including the current and former heads of Common Cause Rhode Island — spoke up to support the lobbyist rule change and reject the gift increase.
Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion took to the podium first. “Why would someone hire a lobbyist if they didn’t have an interest in the outcome of a government decision?” he asked. 
As for the gift increase, Marion argued the desire for more expensive tokens of appreciation derives from a small group of lawmakers. One of those lawmakers is Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III, who submitted a bill this past legislative session that would have upped the gift limit to $50. During the bill’s committee hearing on April 8, Ciccone pooh-poohed the $25 limit — codified in 2005 —  as inadequate given inflation. 
“There is no public demand for this change, just the demand of a handful of legislators who can use their campaign accounts, or their legislative salaries, to buy all the lunches they want,” Marion said.
North Kingstown resident Kathleen Odean thought the existing $25 cap is sufficient. In her years as public librarian in California, “No one gave me any gifts,” Odean said. “And I did my job as well as I could.”
Gramitt said the commission will continue to accept written public comment on the possible changes through Sept. 16, before the panel takes up the issue again at a subsequent meeting. The next two meetings are on Sept. 30 and Oct. 8.
“We’re hopeful that at their next meeting, they’re going to change the gift rule and close the loophole,” Marion said after the meeting. Possible revisions to ethics law could help people “shed the belief” that the Ocean State “has a corruption problem,” he added.
There are also practical benefits to the change. “Public officials should have clarity of what the law says, and that law should say if a person has a lobbyist badge on, they shouldn’t be able to give you a gift more than $25,” Marion said.

‘Three minutes’ for you but not for me
Speaking after Marion was his predecessor H. Philip West Jr., who led Common Cause Rhode Island for 18 years before retiring in 2005. Although he noted he was not speaking on behalf of Common Cause, West offered a systemic critique of the lobbying loophole. 
“It’s very difficult for legislators to tell who is an interested person,” West said. “In fact, it’s almost impossible.”
The categorical exclusion of lobbyists from the state’s present idea of “interested persons” is thoroughly undermined, West thought, by the realities of policymaking. Most small advocacy groups and ordinary citizens get maybe “three minutes” when they testify on bills at the State House, West said. 
But the same is not true for former legislators who take up lobbying after they leave the General Assembly. West shared with the commission a document detailing his admittedly non-comprehensive analysis of former lawmakers who now get paid to lobby. Using public records, West accounted for about $3.5 million paid in the 2025 legislative session to 14 lawmakers-turned-lobbyists, from dozens of clients including Bristol Myers Squibb, Care New England, Brown University Health and Haxton’s Liquors.
While West’s calculations are conservative and not definitive — they exclude hourly work, and assume firms paid the listed lobbyists in six monthly installments — the 14 individuals listed in West’s research seem to represent a massive amount of lobbying muscle. Among the active lobbyists in 2025 who used to be members of the General Assembly are a former House speaker, Senate president and Providence mayor.
“Here’s the important point: They largely conceal what they are lobbying for, from the press and from the public,” West said.
Jones asked West if he was talking about campaign contributions made by lobbyists, which were included in West’s documentation but are firmly outside the commission’s purview. West replied that’s not the case, asserting his main target is the “completely independent” fact of policy discussions behind closed doors — or, just as often, out in the open, at soccer or baseball games or private lunches.










There is no public demand for this change, just the demand of a handful of legislators who can use their campaign accounts, or their legislative salaries, to buy all the lunches they want.

“These lobbyists, for the most part, are not saying to legislators publicly, in public hearings, ‘Here’s what I want you to do.’ They’re doing that in private.”
West reappeared — in book form — during Kate McGovern’s testimony, when the Providence resident held up a copy of West’s 2014 tome, “Scandals and Secrets: Reforming Rhode Island, 1986-2006.” McGovern described a legislative process in her former residence of New Hampshire as one in which all bills get a hearing and committee vote. 
But in Rhode Island, legislation can face a Sisyphean struggle, with some bills returning year after year after year, only to die multiple deaths while waiting to be heard in committee. 
“We got here, and it’s like, ‘What do you mean there hasn’t been a vote on payday lending in a dozen years?’” McGovern recounted, referencing a piece of legislation that failed to pass for years and only after the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio last April.
“The outcome of the lobbying is extremely relevant to what happens at the State House,” McGovern said, noting that whether bills pass committee is not always left up to the committee chairs themselves.
Jessie Kingston, also a Providence resident, told the commission it needs to adopt gift limits amid what she described as a broader context of federal opacity.  
Said Kingston, “If not now, then when?”

Battin federal courthouse in Billings, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan). President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. Attorney for Montana is one of 10 federal prosecutor nominees whose confirmations were delayed last week when a Democratic senator objected.
Kurt Alme has served in the position in an interim role since Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him in March. Alme previously served as chief federal law enforcement official in Montana during President Donald Trump’s first term, from 2017 until 2020, after being recommended by Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. His first nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.
But twice in the last week during Senate proceedings, Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has requested unanimous consent to confirm 10 U.S. Attorney nominees by voice vote, which would bypass the requirement for roll-call votes.
Ranking committee member Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, objected to Grassley’s request last week, citing a precedent set by then-Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, during the Biden administration, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, objected on Monday.
Vance put a limited hold on a limited number of U.S. attorney nominees. Vance further announced in 2023  he intended to place a blanket hold on all Justice Department nominees to “grind it to a halt,” Durbin said in a statement on the Senate floor. As a result, only 68 of Biden’s 76 U.S. attorney nominees made it through the confirmation process.
“I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that you did not agree with Senator Vance’s actions back then, and I don’t believe you do now, but we can’t have one set of rules for Republican presidents and another for Democratic presidents,” Durbin said.
Grassley responded with remarks on the floor asking Democrats to “relent form their partisan obstruction.”
“Debate and disagreement about policy is to be expected, but it should never come at the expense of public safety,” Grassley said.
A statement from Grassley’s office said the move “forces the Senate to burn valuable hours of floor time” to process the nominations, rather than using the expedited voice vote procedure, and added that 94% of President Biden’s U.S. Attorney nominations were approved by voice vote.
So far during Trump’s second term, only two U.S. Attorney’s have been confirmed by the Senate — Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia, and Jason Reding Quiñones for the South District of Florida — both by roll call vote. Durbin similarly blocked a voice vote on Quiñones’ nominations as well.
In a TV appearance Daines said blocking the nominees was an “unprecedented move.”
“We’ve got to to actually change the rules,” Daines said. “We’re working on that as Republicans so that we can go back to where we used to be, and that was getting these nominees like U.S. attorneys and other sub-cabinet level appointees through the U.S. Senate in a timely fashion.”
In a post on social media Tuesday, Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy said the “historic obstruction is making Montanans less safe.”
In months Alme has served in an interim capacity, he has overseen dozens of criminal and civil cases.
After his first stint as U.S. Attorney, Alme worked for Gov. Greg Gianforte as state budget director at the start of the Republican’s first gubernatorial term. He left the position less than a year later, citing the strain of commuting to Helena from his home in Billings.
Most recently, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Alme served as Executive Vice President for Planned Giving with the National Christian Foundation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/James-F.-Battin-Courthouse-Billings-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 15:57:13.927538

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers approved a bill to reauthorize the federal Grain Standards Act, with key updates aimed at modernizing the grain inspection and grading process. 
The bill was passed via a voice vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday evening. Lawmakers said passing the bill ensures the U.S. grain market, and specifically its ability to export grain overseas, can continue operating at the “gold standard.” 
The U.S. Grain Standards Act, first authorized in 1916, gives the federal government the authority to establish marketing standards and procedures for inspection and weighting grains and oilseeds.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson said the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025 plays a “vital role” in the agricultural system, and noted the law ensures “safety, quality and a standard of excellence for the American grain industry.”
The bill reauthorizes the standards in the act that are set to expire at the end of September. 
“If we want America to maintain its status as the safest, most abundant grain supply in the world, reauthorization of this act … is absolutely essential,” Thompson said on the House floor Monday. 
The Pennsylvania Republican, who sponsored the bill, said the grain standards act makes sure farmers get a fair price on their grain, which includes crops like corn, sorghum, wheat, barley and soybeans. Similarly, he said, the standards enforced by the act help foreign buyers feel confident in the quality of American commodities.
In addition to extending the standards through fiscal year 2030, the bill directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to “prioritize the adoption of improved grain grading technology.” 
Grain grading is the process to evaluate the quality of grain, based on specific criteria, which also determines its price. 
Neither Thompson nor the bill detailed what these technology improvements might be, but the bill gives USDA the authority and flexibility to invest in technological upgrades for the process. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the bill, the reauthorization would allocate $23 million annually over the 2026-2030 period to cover the cost of these technological upgrades, as well as the typical procedures of the bill. 
The 2020 reauthorization of the bill also authorized a $23 million annual budget. 
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas, also spoke in favor of the bill Monday and said its calls for technological improvements would create an opportunity to “make the process more accurate, efficient and consistent.” 
“Foreign grain buyers should be confident in the process we have in place to ensure that our experts are adequately inspected,” Davids said. “The bipartisan U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025 is critical for the global grain trade.” 
House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, said in a July 22 hearing on the bill that farmers’ work always has uncertainty, but noted that uncertainty was heightened with the ongoing tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump. 
Craig said the updates to the bill will help USDA focus on modernization, which will keep the U.S. as the “gold standard” in grain inspection and in turn support the sale of grain to foreign countries. 
“The bill’s entire intention is to help ensure grain can get from our farms and grain elevators, onto ships bound for overseas markets,” Craig said. 
The 2025 bill additionally changes the fund to a trust fund, which the CBO analysis said would not be “substantively different” from the current fund and therefore would “not have a budgetary effect.”
Grain Inspection Advisory Committee members would also be allowed to serve until a new member is appointed, under the new bill. Currently, committee members serve staggered, three-year terms. 
Thompson closed his comments by noting that a lapse in authorization of the bill, which expires at the end of the month, would disrupt the grain market and cost the farm economy “more than $70 million a day.” 
The National Grain and Feed Association celebrated the progress of the bill in a press release and the group’s President and CEO Mike Seyfert called it a “must pass bill.”
“This bill strengthens the reliability and competitiveness of U.S. grain by promoting modernization and minimizing red tape,” Seyfert said. “We now urge the Senate to act swiftly so this important legislation can be sent to President Trump for signature.”

“Indiana isn’t a playground for electoral shenanigans, and we won’t let Washington outsiders tell us how to run our state,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters. “Hoosiers play fair. We believe in honest elections, fair maps and a democracy that works for all of us. These signatures represent that commitment.”
 It’s unclear if there’s any overlap with an earlier petition that had more than 4,000 signatures submitted last month, though both voting rights coalitions featured Common Cause Indiana. 
Traditionally, redistricting occurs following the once-a-decade census — with the latest maps dating back to 2021. President Donald Trump, seeking to grow the historically slim Republican majority in the U.S. House, has pressured Republican states to pursue redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Trump has personally appealed to both Republican caucus leaders in recent weeks — as has Vice President JD Vance. Gov. Mike Braun has said he’ll wait to hear from legislative leadership about early redistricting before calling a special session.
Such an effort will not be as transparent as 2021’s map-drawing session, which featured several public forums in each of the nine congressional districts and didn’t have any legal challenges. An August poll of 1,662 Hoosiers found that the majority, or 52%, opposed any early redistricting. Of those, 43% were “very opposed.”

A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that the Mid Vermont Christian School must be allowed to participate in state athletics, two years after being banned for forfeiting against a team with a transgender player. The court returned the case to district court for further proceedings.
The ruling comes after several years of litigation by the pre-K-12 private Christian school in Quechee. The Vermont Principals’ Association barred the school from participating in state athletics after the school forfeited a girls’ playoff basketball game in February 2023 to avoid playing the Long Trail School, which had a transgender player on the team.
School officials at the time said they were concerned that playing against “a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of the players,” and its head of school, Vicky Fogg, told Valley News that allowing “biological males to participate in women’s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women’s sports in general.”

The Vermont Principals’ Association governs rules around school sports in Vermont, and said at the time that Mid Vermont Christian violated its anti-discrimination and gender identity policies.
The school, along with several parents and students, sued in federal court in 2023, seeking reinstatement of the school’s membership to the Vermont Principals’ Association.
According to Tuesday’s court ruling, Mid Vermont Christian School argued that “forcing girls to compete against the biological males would affirm that those males are females,” in violation of their religious beliefs.
U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford in June 2024 denied the school’s request to be readmitted to the principals’ association.
But on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed that decision and agreed with the school’s claims, writing that they were “likely to succeed” in showing that the association’s exclusion of the school “was not neutral because it displayed hostility toward the school’s religious beliefs.”
Judge Michael H. Park, writing for the court, wrote that the principals’ association “publicly castigated Mid Vermont — and religious schools generally — while the VPA rushed to judgment on whether and how to discipline the school.” Park said that the punishment they imposed on the school “was unprecedented, overbroad, and procedurally irregular.”
The court sent the case back to the federal district court for further proceedings.
Jay Nichols said Tuesday the Vermont Principals’ Association, its officers and employees “do not harbor any hostility towards religious viewpoints,” but declined to comment further, citing pending litigation.
A spokesperson for the state’s Agency of Education declined to comment, also citing pending litigation.
The school was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a preeminent conservative Christian legal group that has had a growing presence in Vermont education and politics.
The group, in a press release, called the ruling a “victory for religious schools.”
David Cortman, senior counsel and vice president of U.S. litigation for the group, said in the press release that the appeals court was “right to uphold constitutional protections by guaranteeing the school can fully participate while still adhering to its religious beliefs.”
Chris Goodwin, the Mid Vermont Christian School girls’ basketball coach, said in the press release that the school strives “to exemplify biblical truth in and through everything we do.”
“We’re grateful for our legal team at Alliance Defending Freedom who helped us get back in the game,” he said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — CVS Caremark will pay a $32.1 million settlement for allegedly keeping money that “belonged” to the state employee health plan, HealthChoice, the Attorney General’s Office said Tuesday. 
CVS Caremark agreed to the settlement to avoid litigation but has denied any wrongdoing, the Attorney General’s Office said. CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager that works to negotiate prices between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. 
“When drug companies give discounts and rebates for medications, CVS Caremark was supposed to pass that money on to HealthChoice,” according to a news release from Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office. “Instead, the state contends that CVS kept millions of dollars that should have gone to help lower healthcare costs for state employees from January 2020 through December 2024.”
CVS Caremark is set to pay Oklahoma $32.1 million under the terms of the settlement. About $27 million of this goes to HealthChoice once lawyer fees to pay for outside counsel are deducted, according to a news release. 
Under the settlement terms, CVS Caremark will also report any collected rebates every quarter to ensure “greater transparency and accountability,” according to the release. 
“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” Drummond said in a statement. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.” 
Drummond said his office is continuing to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly under reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies for acquiring prescription drugs. In January he estimated could recover around $2 million in fees and restitution.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-09 19:08:18+00:00,CT Mirror,"One year in, CT correction ombuds has nearly 400 complaints and no staff",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/09/correction-ombuds-staff-hiring/,DeVaughn Ward told Correction Advisory Committee hiring was delayed after CT legislature doubled his budget and he shifted his staffing plans.,"A year after his appointment as ombuds for the Department of Correction, DeVaughn Ward has a backlog of 388 complaints and no staff to help address them. 
Ward said during a meeting of the Correction Advisory Committee last Thursday that he was heartbroken he’s been unable to respond to many of the incarcerated people who reach out to him. 
“It’s a horrible feeling. Every single day I hear some type of atrocity that’s going on in a facility, and I don’t have the tools or the staff to be able to deal with it,” Ward said. 
Ward told the Connecticut Mirror he’s been asking the state’s Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Policy and Management, the agencies responsible for hiring and for the state’s budget, to hire staff for the office since last November. 
Initially, there was only enough money to hire two people. The Office of Policy and Management had approved those positions, an agency spokesperson said. 
But hiring plans changed in June when the legislature voted to increase the budget of the ombuds office from $400,000 annually to $800,000. The additional funding allowed for a total of five positions — an administrative assistant, a clerk typist, an associate ombuds, an assistant ombuds focused on investigations and a nurse consultant. At Ward’s request, hiring for the two original positions was discontinued in favor of the new positions.
Ward said that two of those positions, the administrative assistant and the clerk typist, have since been posted on the state’s employment website and the postings closed last week. He said he hopes the positions will be filled by October, so the office can begin to address the backlog in complaints.  
Ward said not being able to answer complaints jeopardizes his relationship with the people he serves. “The confidence in the office amongst the incarcerated community is just being eroded. And that’s very unfortunate,” he said. 
The lack of a nurse consultant poses a particular problem, Ward said, since he is required to submit a report to state lawmakers by Dec. 1 on the quality of healthcare in the correctional facilities. Without that position, Ward said he did not believe it would be possible for him to meet that deadline. 
Chris Collibee, spokesman for the Office of Policy and Management, said the nurse consultant position required the creation of a new job class, which the administration is currently working with labor relations to create. 
“The administration remains committed to ensuring this office has positions that the legislature has approved and that all state labor agreements are followed for job classifications,” said Collibee, who noted he was also speaking for the Department of Administrative Services and the governor’s office. 
Collibee said the assistant ombuds position had been approved by the office. He underscored that his agency must follow the state’s established hiring process in recruiting for the positions. 
The Department of Administrative Services, which oversees hiring, did not respond to more detailed questions. 
During their meeting with Ward Thursday, members of the Correction Advisory Committee also expressed frustration and confusion about the delays in hiring. 
“It’s very hard for me, personally, to understand why, after a year, there is no progress here,” said Tadhg Dooley, the co-chair of the committee and an attorney with Wiggin and Dana LLP.
Dooley’s fellow co-chair, Marisol Garcia, told CT Mirror she thought the delay was “ridiculous” and that it was indicative of the state’s priorities around criminal justice. 
“This office has had struggles since its inception for support,” she said. (Garcia is also a member of CT Mirror’s Board of Directors.)
In a call with CT Mirror, Ward called the bureaucratic delays “death by a thousand cuts” for his office. He expressed frustration that DOC had been able to hire a number of correctional officers, but he was unable to hire a single position in his office. 
According to Andrius Banevicius, a spokesperson for the Department of Correction, the department has hired 155 correctional officers since July 1.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1109_SR_CheshirePrison_008-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 15:57:13.927538

(Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)KOTZEBUE, ALASKA — Have you ever had a bad day outside, and just wanted to stop?
As an enthusiastic skier, biker and runner, I’ve struggled through my fair share of races when I wasn’t at my best. But I’d never given in to the impulse until a late summer day a few weeks ago.
As a participant in a half marathon in this Northwest Alaska hub town — a race I’d signed up for 36 hours before the start — I’d run about eight miles and had five to go. My legs hurt, and the carpet of tundra just off the road looked soft and inviting.
Welcome to the Cape Blossom Marathon and Half — the northernmost organized marathon in America, and, so far as I know, the only one where nobody will judge you if you take a break during the middle of the race to sit in the moss and shove sun-warmed blueberries into your mouth.
As a matter of transparency: My friend Hannah Atkinson is the race organizer. She is not paying me to hype up the Cape Blossom Marathon. But the time I spent 30 miles above the Arctic Circle last month was sufficiently joyous to justify some free advertising and a bit of rural Alaska travel writing in Northern Journal.
The City of Kotzebue, which sponsors the event, is already planning the second official edition next year, on Aug. 29. Here are some of the reasons you should go.
1. Unlike running races on the road system, where you might have to train religiously to vie for a top result, you are practically guaranteed an age-group podium at the Cape Blossom race. Just 12 people finished this year’s half marathon, and only five finished the full marathon. Everyone got a sweet finisher’s medal, and a certificate signed by the city mayor.
Did your marathon cross the Arctic Circle? (Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)
2. Boats! Marathon competitors took a 10-mile ride across Kotzebue Sound, south from downtown to Cape Blossom, where one day the city plans to build a deepwater port. From the beach at Cape Blossom, the course led back to town — but not without more boats! To get past a creek between Cape Blossom and Kotzebue, runners had to climb into a communal kayak and, with volunteers, paddle themselves across.
3. Other pre-marathon pasta feeds might feature dubiously sourced meat sauce. At the Cape Blossom Marathon, community members cooked up noodles not just with ground caribou, but also with ground moose. Other dinner options: fresh-caught trout and chum salmon, including one filet garnished with the classic combination of cheese, onion and mayonnaise. (If you’re still only cooking your salmon with lemon and dill, it’s time to branch out.)

4. The whole community, including the runners, pitches in and supports the event. The night before the race, Hannah enlisted me in organizing snacks for the aid stations; meanwhile, city workers stayed late after dinner at the Kotzebue Boys and Girls Club to fill water jugs. During the race, every runner I passed gave me a high-five.

5. As they say in the Northwest Arctic, Aug. 24 is always a good day. Okay, actually, they don’t say that, and I think the weather in Kotzebue in late August has the potential to be prettttty cold and unpleasant. Hannah asked us to bring a fur hat and mittens that she accidentally had left in Anchorage. But on this particular Aug. 24, the sun came out, and the half marathon took me, plus some old and new friends, down a glorious stretch of beach along the sound, then up to the bluffs and on to a road through the tundra. In other words, the weather and scenery in Kotzebue can be sweet in the late summer, and it’s worth rolling the dice because sometimes you might win.

After an awards ceremony back at the Boys and Girls Club, we capped off the day with an official race barbecue on the beach, roasting Costco hot dogs over a pile of burning pallets. Some of us swam. Twice. There were sled dog puppies. New friends exchanged phone numbers and emails. Late-night pizza, kimchi and keepsakes were procured from Uutuku, one of Kotzebue’s incredible convenience stores.
Everyone needs a souvenir from Uutuku. (Northern Journal)
Moral of the story: Getting off the road system is almost always worthwhile. Buy more last-minute mileage tickets for weekend visits to rural hubs. And sign up for next year’s Cape Blossom Marathon. There’s an email list where you can register for updates.
And no, I won’t leave you with a cliffhanger: I did, in fact, begrudgingly get up from my comfortable perch on the tundra and finish the race. I plan to go back next year — and I may or may not be better prepared.

Thirty prominent professional health organizations signed an open letter urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The rollout of updated COVID-19 vaccines has left many North Carolinians puzzled over whether they qualify for the new booster shots.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the new Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax shots for all seniors at the end of August. But for younger Americans, there are restrictions — at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity, according to the Associated Press.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. told a Senate committee during a hearing last week that access to the new shots “depends on the states.”
In North Carolina, the state Department of Health and Human Services is “closely monitoring” changes in federal guidelines, spokesperson Summer Tonizzo told NC Newsline.
“We are actively exploring options to improve vaccine availability and ensure that all North Carolinians have convenient access to vaccinations throughout the state,” Tonizzo said in a statement.
Following state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina can administer those vaccines recommended by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , but ACIP has yet to give their recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season.
“Without ACIP recommendations, COVID vaccines may only be available from a pharmacist in North Carolina for those ages 18 and up with a prescription,” Tonizzo clarified.
That leaves many North Carolina pharmacists and medical providers anxiously waiting for the outcome of ACIP’s meeting Sept. 18 and 19.  At least five states have decided not to wait on that guidance and are making the shots widely available now.
At the moment, CVS MinuteClinic is offering the updated shots to patients in North Carolina if they present an authorized prescription, a spokesperson from the company told NC Newsline. Prescriptions are not required in neighboring South Carolina and Tennessee due to different state pharmacy laws.
COVID-19 vaccines are available at Walgreens in the state for eligible patients with a valid prescription, a spokesperson told NC Newsline.
Patients can review their vaccine eligibility and schedule appointments at CVS or Walgreens by speaking with their local pharmacists or checking online.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/COVID-shot-Getty-2025.jpg,,,2025-09-09 15:57:13.927538

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After their pursuit of taxpayer school funding failed to get approval from the U.S. Supreme Court, Oklahoma Catholic leaders have canceled plans to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School and will open a private online academy instead.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa announced Monday the opening of St. Carlo Acutis Classical Academy in the 2026-27 school year. Named for a recently canonized millennial saint, the tuition-based virtual school will enroll up to 300 students statewide in kindergarten through eighth grade before adding a freshman class the following year.
Meanwhile, the website for St. Isidore of Seville virtual school, named for the patron saint of the internet, is no longer reachable. Archdiocese of Oklahoma City spokesperson John Helsley confirmed that plans to open St. Isidore have been discontinued.
A member of St. Isidore’s Board of Directors, Brett Farley, also verified the school will no longer open.
Catholic leaders will not seek state dollars for St. Carlo Acutis Classical Academy beyond a tax credit that assists private school students with tuition and fees, Farley and Helsley said.

The academy’s website shows St. Carlo Acutis will have the same governing board members who sat on St. Isidore’s Board of Directors, including Farley and other archdiocese officials.
The new school also will fulfill a primary goal intended for St. Isidore, which was to make Catholic schooling available to students in all parts of the state.
Many rural areas have no parish school, said Misty Smith, the academy’s head of school. 
“One of the things we established through St. Isidore was that there’s (a) definite need to reach every corner of our state for good quality Catholic education,” Smith said. “And so, Carlo Acutis was one of the things that we decided we need to go with this. We need to actually provide this to the Catholic families and to really anybody who’s interested in it.”
Smith said the new academy will be a “better and different experience” than what students might have had at St. Isidore. Unlike the original virtual school concept, St. Carlo Acutis will have a classical school curriculum — a method of education often focusing on liberal arts, classic literature, and philosophy or theology.
Teachers will give live instruction online, and students will have opportunities for hands-on learning, Smith said. The school’s focus “will be nurturing the Christian development of each student” and providing guidelines for academic excellence within the context of the Catholic faith, the archdiocese has said.
The academy is already accredited, so families will be able to apply for Oklahoma’s parental choice tax credit right away, Smith said. Enrollment is expected to begin this winter.

The fight to open St. Isidore of Seville as the nation’s first religious charter school started in 2023 with an application to the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board. Later that year, the board approved the school’s opening in a 3-2 vote that made national headlines. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, contending the concept of a government-funded religious school “eviscerates” the constitutional separation of church and state. The state Supreme Court agreed with Drummond and blocked the school from opening.
Catholic leaders and the Statewide Charter School Board, which has since dropped the word “virtual” from its name, then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. They contended charter schools are actually private entities contracted with the state and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case on April 30. The justices ultimately deadlocked at 4-4, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. 
That allowed the Oklahoma Supreme Court decision against the school to stand.
The new virtual academy will bear the name of the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, who was born in 1991 in London and raised in Italy. Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis on Sunday.
Acutis died in 2006 at age 15 from leukemia. Tulsa Bishop David Konderla said Acutis created a website documenting Eucharistic miracles that “inspired and educated people around the world.” 
“His life exemplified humility, piety, devotion, and discipline,” Konderla said in the school’s announcement. “His faith-filled life continues to inspire young people everywhere.”

Darren Bailey, who lost the 2022 governor’s race by 13 points to Gov. JB Pritzker, will try again. 
The post Sources: Darren Bailey to run for governor again in Illinois by Ben Szalinski appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Former state senator and unsuccessful candidate for governor and later Congress Darren Bailey is pictured at the 2023 Illinois State Fair during his unsuccessful congressional campaign. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Jerry Nowicki) 
Article Summary

Former State Sen. Darren Bailey will announce a second campaign for governor, according to sources close to Bailey.
Cook County Republican Party Chair Aaron Del Mar will be Bailey’s running mate, according to a source.
Bailey lost the 2022 election to Gov. JB Pritzker by 13 points after a strong showing in the Republican primary. He later lost a race to unseat incumbent Republican Congressman Mike Bost.
Bailey would likely be the fourth person to announce plans to challenge Pritzker this year.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Darren Bailey plans to run for governor for a second time in 2026, Capitol News Illinois confirmed with sources close to the campaign.
The former state senator and farmer from Clay County would become the highest-profile Republican to enter the race, having lost the 2022 campaign against Gov. JB Pritzker and a close primary race in 2024 against U.S. Rep. Mike Bost for a downstate congressional seat.
A formal announcement is expected next week. News of the planned announcement was first reported by NBC Chicago on Monday afternoon.
Bailey rose to statewide notoriety in 2020 as a state lawmaker who opposed mask mandates and other COVID-19 emergency actions early in the pandemic. He capitalized on his opposition to the Pritzker-imposed restrictions and ran for governor in 2022.
Bailey easily won the Republican primary that year with 57% of the vote. His campaign was indirectly helped by Pritzker, who ran TV ads during the primary calling Bailey “too conservative” for Illinois, which helped to boost his credentials with Republican voters.
But Pritzker handily won a second term with 55% of the vote, defeating Bailey by 13 points in a race that the Associated Press called for Pritzker just moments after the polls closed. Pritzker dumped millions of dollars into his campaign as Bailey struggled to compete despite receiving some financial help from Lake Forest billionaire Dick Uihlein.
Bailey then tried to unseat Bost in 2024 in the 12th Congressional District but came up about 2,700 votes short. While he received President Donald Trump’s endorsement in the governor’s race, Trump endorsed Bost over Bailey in 2024.
New running mate
Bailey plans to enlist Cook County Republican Party Chair Aaron Del Mar as his running mate, a source said.
Del Mar ran for lieutenant governor in 2022 alongside Gary Rabine, receiving 6.5% of the vote.


Aaron Del Mar, chair of the Cook County Republican Party, is pictured at the Republican State Central Committee’s August meeting. He will be the running mate for former state Sen. Darren Bailey as he tries to run again for governor, sources told Capitol News Illinois.

Del Mar was elected to lead the Cook County Republican Party earlier this year, marking the second time he has held that role after previously leading the party in the early 2010s. He is also a member of the Illinois GOP’s State Central Committee and is Palatine Township’s highway commissioner.
Outside of politics, Del Mar has led a career in business and as an entrepreneur.
Bailey ran in 2022 with Stephanie Trussell, a conservative radio host from the west suburbs.
Bailey’s message
It’s unclear how Bailey plans to overcome his 2022 loss and what message he will take to voters in 2026.
He focused much of his 2022 campaign on crime and public safety, criticizing the SAFE-T Act and bashing Chicago as a “hellhole.”

The message failed to gain traction with voters, however, as Democrats focused heavily on abortion rights in the months after Roe v. Wade was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Facebook has been Bailey’s primary communication platform to voters, and in recent weeks, he has focused many of his posts on Pritzker and various ways he believes the governor has failed Illinois. Like other Republicans, Bailey has criticized Pritzker’s growing national profile.
“In 2026, we have the chance to stop him,” Bailey wrote in a post Monday. “But it will take ALL of us. Every Illinoisan who knows we deserve better. Together, we can end JB’s presidential ambitions before they even begin and finally turn Illinois around.”

Bailey would become at least the fourth candidate to enter the Republican primary for governor, which has been slowing taking shape this fall. DuPage County Sheriff Jim Mendrick, Lake Forest resident Joe Severino, and conservative media writer Ted Dabrowski have also formed committees to run for governor.
Antioch Mayor Scott Gartner released a statement Sunday saying he was also considering running for governor as a Republican.
Pritzker is running for a rare third term as governor amid speculation he will also run for president in 2028. Candidates must turn their petitions in to the State Board of Elections by the end of October.
Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service that distributes state government coverage to hundreds of news outlets statewide. It is funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.

One member of the task force, Stacey Patrick, has been a resident of the south Jackson complex for nearly 17 years. JXN Water, the city’s privately run water utility, discontinued services to Blossom Apartments in late July after its owner had long failed to pay the bill.
“When they fall short, we are still hurt,” Patrick said during the meeting. “We are the ones that are still hurt. Is there anything they could put in place that it wouldn’t affect us?”
In addition to living without water, Patrick said she and her husband, Robert, have been working daily for the last month on applications for apartments around Jackson. The search has been difficult, she said, because many places require security deposits and proof of salary up to three times the amount of the rent. 
“It’s very hard. It’s not easy,” Patrick said. “It’s not like it used to be where there’s a sign, you call them and you can get into a place. I’ve never seen it like this before.”
Patrick hoped they had finally gotten a break with Arbor Park Apartments, but after paying nearly $1,600 to claim a unit, once it was time to move in, it was uninhabitable, trashed and filthy.
“She (the property manager) had us believing that we were supposedly getting into a place for a whole month,” she told Mississippi Today. “She kept us on hold. We could have been out there trying to find other housing.”
Patrick is now waiting for a refund from the apartments.

After JXN Water initially shut off services to Blossom Apartments in July, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate twice ordered the water temporarily restored. But those extensions have run out, and since then, Patrick said the Jackson Fire Department has ceased delivering water to residents. Mississippi Home Corporation deemed the property unfit for housing in early August. In addition to Patrick, roughly a dozen families are still living at the complex without water as they struggle to find a new place. 
“ It’s just a hard thing that we’re going through right now because of this water shut off, and it’s not easy going out here trying to find a place. It’s not easy at all,” Patrick said. 
Since mid-August, Stewpot Community Services has been working to relocate Blossom residents. The nonprofit has placed a few residents in hotels, while others are waiting it out with family members. Jill Buckley, director of Stewpot, said that of the 27 households it has identified through management records and door-knocking, they’ve been able to rehouse eight families.
“One thing that has really slowed the process down is the HUD inspections for people who have housing vouchers, so waiting for the inspections to happen has been a little frustrating,” Buckley said.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires rental property inspections to ensure their habitability and safety. Buckley said another issue residents are facing is the availability of apartments across Jackson. 
Eight of the 11-member Housing Task Force were in attendance at Monday’s meeting. Attorney Robert Ireland, who is representing another complex in its lawsuit with JXN Water over nonpayment, resigned from the task force to avoid a conflict of interest, said Nic Lott, Jackson’s communications director.
Task force vice-chair Jennifer Welch, who owns and manages properties in Jackson, Hattiesburg and Meridian, described one issue impacting JXN Water as “churn.” Limited liability companies rack up large water bills, terminate the account and then establish a new LLC to open a new account with JXN Water. 
“The property doesn’t even change ownership,” Welch said. “It’s just new LLCs being established really for this purpose of fraud, in my opinion.”
Welch said initiating a multifamily account with JXN Water should be as rigorous as applying for a loan. Landlords should be required to have a deed, be in good standing with the Secretary of State’s office and provide personal information and a working contact number or email for the manager of the LLC, she said.
“ There’s a lot of times when I sign up for a random account and they’re verifying that my phone number is legit,” Welch said. “Can we not do that if someone’s gonna be able to have a $150,000 water bill?”
Carla Dazet, a billing executive for JXN Water, also attended the meeting, though not as the company’s official designee to the task force. She said JXN Water has now implemented a process for shut-offs – whether it’s a residential, commercial or multi-family account, once the account is past-due 60 days, the property will lose water.  
“It won’t be a compounded annual delinquency. It’ll just be two months,” Dazet said. “That’s going forward. That’s already in place, so we don’t have to worry about the big bills building up.”
Welch also noted that as a property manager, she has found it increasingly difficult to purchase insurance for her properties due to the perception of high crime in the city.
“If we can prove that those areas are changing, I think that it can make it easier for people like myself to get insurance,” Welch said. 
Task force members also discussed city ordinances and code enforcement. Earnest Ward, president of the Association of South Jackson Neighborhoods, said he performs routine inspections on his properties, something that other landlords are lax to do. 
Units get damaged, cars rust away in yards, and some tenants have multiple pets that are destructive to the property which further decreases the value, he said. A solution he proposed is including city ordinances around rental inspections in the lease agreement. 
“I think it needs to be done regularly. They know what they expect,” Ward said. “Certain things they probably won’t do, but I think the landlord needs to take more of their responsibility on inspecting their own property.”
In 2022, the city made changes to its rental registration ordinance in an effort to track compliance and tackle blight. According to figures shared during the meeting, the goal was to inspect nearly 11,000 units, but the city fell short by inspecting only 3,200.
The city also relaunched the rental registry and inspection program, which requires  landlords to register properties and provides an avenue for tenants to record complaints. Victoria Love, the rental registry manager, said there are currently about 50 open cases, and most cases are closed within 30 days, though some have been open for up to 90 days. 
“Where you do have a slight issue is on some of your smaller landlords,” Love said. “A lot of times, they just don’t have additional capital to repair things completely.”
Welch said the information in the registry could be outdated and that the task force should consider recommending that the city conduct annual updates.
“Operators are changing, property managers are changing, things happen,” Welch said. “I think that the city needs to be putting effort into updating the information that’s registered.”

Private equity is a broad term referring to investments in private companies — i.e. those that are not publicly traded on the stock market. It’s often the venue of the wealthiest investors like pension funds, university endowments and the most affluent families and has drawn scrutiny for extracting value from companies by loading them up with debt or cutting their quality. 
Seventeen percent of the state’s $146 billion pension fund dollars are invested in private equity, according to the State Board of Investment’s most recent report. Minnesota was among the first states to invest its pension funds significantly in private equity, and the State Board of Investment does a good job of negotiating with private equity fund managers to strike deals and negotiate lower fees, according to a report released Monday by Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, a think tank on tax and fiscal policy issues.  
But the same report goes on to say the promise of private equity’s higher returns comes with some downsides, including less transparency, higher fees and significant risk. 
A spokesperson for the State Board of Investment said the board has not yet reviewed the report, and pointed to the pension funds’ strong performance — returns of more than 10% annually over the past five years.
Minnesota’s investments have come under scrutiny recently; Ryan Leitner of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project wrote a Reformer guest commentary criticizing the board’s consideration of an investment in a firm that owns an Ohio coal power plant. Some pro-Palestine protestors have called on the State Board of Investment to divest from Israel by selling off its investments in Israeli bonds and companies linked to the war in Gaza. 
Private equity funds compete with each other for investments, and so are incentivized to keep some details of their operation private. The State Board of Investment, on the other hand, has to abide by the transparency requirements that come with the management of taxpayer money. An increase in transparency by the state could mean the firms no longer want to do business with Minnesota pension funds.
The State Board of Investment recently started disclosing the total amount in private market management fees paid, but doesn’t report those fees on a per-fund basis.
“It’s also not unreasonable to assume that SBI is also concerned that making unfamiliar data and details available to the public can generate the opposite of transparency and understanding — a fertile environment for misinterpretation, confusion, misuse, and erroneous conclusions,” the report reads.
The report concludes with a recommendation that the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement hold public hearings on the topic of transparency in private equity investments.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/investments.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 14:57:52.858933

U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz via U.S. House
House Republicans announced last week that they were forming a select subcommittee to investigate the attack and potentially the previous-run Jan. 6 Committee. That panel — which included seven Democrats and two Republicans — produced an 845-page report in December 2022 after an 18-month investigation. It concluded that President Donald Trump was the “central cause” of the riots.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced on Monday that Moskowitz would participate.
“In their continued campaign of distraction, my esteemed colleagues across the aisle have found a new target: the events of January 6. But make no mistake: we will not let their efforts rewrite the dark day that it was,” Moskowitz said in a written statement.
“I look forward to serving on this committee that can only be described as a giant waste of time and taxpayer dollars, and I hope that one day soon we can get back to answering the American people’s call to lower costs and solve problems.”
The other Democrats on the committee are California’s Eric Swallwell and Texas’ Jasmine Crockett. Maryland’s Jamie Raskin, as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, will serve as an ex officio member.
In his statement, Jeffries said Republicans were “trying to rewrite history and corrupt our electoral system” with the new committee and vowed that “House Democrats will continue to forcefully and aggressively fight back.”

Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. They retain rebates and discounts from contracts, but some consumers and pharmacies have said they are unsure how much savings are being passed on. In the cases that Miyares’ office is investigating, the question is if certain PBMs and drug producers raised costs in violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. 
That state law authorizes the state attorney general to investigate when there is reason to believe companies have engaged in fraudulent or deceptive practices. 
“Thousands of Virginians live with diabetes, and none of them should have to worry whether they can afford the medication they need to survive. My Office is investigating the companies behind the soaring cost of insulin to protect Virginia families,” Miyares said in a release announcing the investigation on Tuesday. “My Office will not hesitate to act.”
Miyares co-signs letter urging congressional PBM reform as Youngkin weighs Virginia’s own efforts

Miyares has previously signed onto a national letter urging congressional reforms to PBMs. Meanwhile a bipartisan group of state lawmakers passed the “Save Local Pharmacies Act” earlier this year and it was approved by outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
If implemented, the law will create a single state-contracted pharmacy benefit manager in Medicaid — a move supporters say would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat.
The next governor, either Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, can oversee its rollout. 
Earle-Sears pulled out of a planned interview with The Mercury where she would have been asked various health care questions, to include one about her support or opposition of the PBM reform. Spanberger reiterated her support in an August interview, after previously disclosing it at a campaign event this summer.

A program piloting automated speed enforcement cameras, which Gov. Phil Scott signed into law last year, remains on the drawing board. “Why aren’t we being protected?” one worker asked.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont promised new tech to keep highway workers safe. It still hasn’t arrived..","WILLISTON — Kellen Cloud’s line of work has always been dangerous.
For the better part of the past two decades, Cloud has worked at Green Mountain Flagging, a company that stations traffic controllers at construction sites around the state. He recalled when a coworker had their body pushed by an impatient driver, and when another had to jump out of the way of a truck that would not slow down.
“You have to be a little crazy to do this job,” he said with a laugh, during an interview last month at the company’s headquarters in Williston.
In recent years, though, Cloud said his job has gotten noticeably more dangerous. People seem to be driving more recklessly than in the past, he said — something data suggests could be a lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, data also shows more people are injured or killed in work zones today than a decade ago. 
It’s a concern that led Cloud, along with many others in the state’s construction industry, he said, to support a state plan aimed at bolstering speed enforcement in work zones using relatively new technology: automated cameras. 
The program, which Gov. Phil Scott signed into law in May 2024, would deploy cameras at a small number of highway work zones around the state over a period of 15 months. The cameras would capture photos of the license plates of cars going at least 10 miles per hour over the posted speed limit. After a review by a police officer, speeding drivers would be mailed a warning notice, and if they offended again, could face civil fines.
Under the law, the state was required to start a public outreach campaign about the use of the cameras on April 1, 2025, with a pilot taking effect July 1. But the program — which already exists in some form in more than 15 other states — has yet to materialize.
Vermont Agency of Transportation leaders have said they could not meet the pilot’s deadlines because no law enforcement agency has yet raised its hand to help out. Even though the cameras are automated, under the legislation creating Vermont’s program, a police officer must review the images the cameras collect and send out citations. 
That delay has frustrated some legislative leaders in recent months. They’ve criticized Scott’s administration for failing to implement a program the administration supported — especially when there’s often little consequence for speeding through work zones now.
That’s because while police officers typically park near construction sites with their cruisers’ lights flashing, they’re encouraged to remain at their posts rather than leave to chase down a speeder, several state officials said.
Joe Flynn, Vermont’s transportation secretary, said his agency is committed to getting the pilot program underway, even though it will be on a slower timeline than the Legislature dictated. He said officials are confident the cameras could change drivers’ behavior; data from Pennsylvania, for instance, shows speeding in work zones has dropped by 37% since that state first deployed a similar automated system five years ago.

“We just can’t see this being what we thought it would be,” Flynn said of the program as written in the 2024 law. “We need to just rework it. So that’s what we’re doing.”
But Cloud said that, for him and his colleagues, the safety improvements the cameras could bring are long overdue. Cloud is now Green Mountain Flagging’s operations director, training new employees regularly. He called the delay “frustrating” and “discouraging.” 
“It’s our job to protect,” he said. “Why aren’t we being protected?”
‘Pass a hot potato’
That a program using automated technology would be hobbled by concerns about human staffing seems counterintuitive. But leaders in the Scott administration have been adamant that unless lawmakers remove police officers from the process, the administration may not be able — or willing — to move the program forward.

The legislation states that a “law enforcement officer” has to be the one to issue citations for speeding through work zones, but it does not task a specific agency with that work. However, as the law was being finalized last year, according to Flynn, it was “starting to seem as though this was going to fall squarely” on the Vermont State Police, even though it wasn’t necessarily designed that way. 
During a House Transportation Committee hearing in May, state police leaders insisted they did not have the resources to help facilitate the program. Col. Matthew Birmingham, the director of the state police, said the agency had 54 open positions among its ranks of certified troopers at the time, or about a 17% vacancy rate.
“It just would not make any sense to me,” he told committee members. “There will be something that will have to be given up — and at this point I don’t know what that is because everything we’re handling is violent crime and crimes against people and potentially dangerous crimes like DUI and aggravated aggressive driving.”
Vermont Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison — whose department includes the state police — also pushed back on the idea the state police could take on the work. She told legislators the issue is “not one of our willingness to enforce traffic laws,” but rather “one of resource allocation.” To illustrate her point, she and the department’s policy director, Mandy Wooster, offered estimates of the amount of time it could take officers to review the violations generated by the pilot program each day.

Wooster said part of the challenge would be officers needing to cross-reference the identity of the owner of a speeding car with a database of people who are members of the U.S. military, because soldiers and sailors on active duty can get extended time to pay or contest certain citations, such as speeding tickets, under federal law.
She told the committee that, when accounting for that database check, it could take seven or eight minutes to process each violation. She said the administration had been operating under an assumption there would be a maximum of 1,000 citations issued during a regular, eight-hour workday — which, when multiplied by the time to process each case, could result in well over 100 hours of officers’ time each day.
That’s in addition to extra time required if people who received a violation contested the ticket in court, which is allowed under Vermont’s law as written, Morrison noted.
“I’m not looking to pass a hot potato over to someone else,” the commissioner said. “But I’m very clearly signaling that we do not have the capacity to take this on as the sole owner of this project.”

Per the legislation, drivers would face no fine for a first offense caught on camera, an $80 fine for a second offense and a $160 fine for a third offense, provided those subsequent violations occurred within a year. A violation would not levy any points on a driver’s license, state officials have said. 
Not everyone agrees with the administration’s estimates, though. Rep. Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, the transportation committee’s ranking member, said Morrison and Wooster were relying on the “worst case scenario” and, in his view, exaggerating the amount of officer time the program would require. If 1,000 people were speeding through work zones every day, he contended, the state had a problem on its hands that warranted addressing immediately.
Pouech pointed to earlier testimony the committee received from a company that makes and operates automated speed enforcement cameras describing how it could take less than one and a half minutes to review each violation.
“The state police clearly just put up a giant smoke screen with their calculations of how much time this was going to take,” Pouech, who’s among the program’s most vocal supporters, said in an interview. “It seems like that was more of an excuse.”

In Pennsylvania — which Flynn said operates the closest example to what is being proposed in Vermont — a dedicated state police unit reviews all automated violations that carry fines, according to a report on the program. Last year, automated cameras were used roughly 2,500 times across 55 different roadway projects in that state. 
Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Sgt. Logan T. Brouse wrote in an email that it takes three minutes for officers to process speed camera violations in that state on average.
Flynn said that, even considering data from other states, he stood by the administration’s time estimates for the program in Vermont. Compared to Pennsylvania, Vermont is a far smaller state with more limited law enforcement resources, he said. 
When Vermont’s state police say they can’t help run the pilot, Flynn said, “I take it on face value — and I don’t question what they say about (their) ability to manage this, or not.”

‘They’re sitting on their hands’
At the same time, officials considered — and decided against — having another statewide law enforcement agency support the program. The Department of Motor Vehicles Enforcement and Safety Division, which is under the purview of the transportation agency, has a number of certified police officers on its staff. 
The “DMV Police” inspect commercial vehicles for safety and conduct their own highway speed enforcement, among other duties, Flynn said. Notably, the force is fully staffed, with Flynn estimating the division has 30 employees statewide.
But Flynn said he was hesitant to commit one or more of his officers’ time to reviewing and issuing citations. The small force’s time, he said, is better spent out in the field where it often backs up other law enforcement agencies, including the state police.
“It just seemed to really be overly burdensome to field forces who otherwise are already fully busy on a daily basis,” he said. “Where can you best use the really highly talented and trained resources that you have, when really, this is an administrative process?”
Flynn said he now plans to meet with leaders from another realm of law enforcement — the state’s 14 county sheriffs — to find out if any of their departments could support the pilot program, rather than a statewide law enforcement agency. 
Lamoille County Sheriff Roger Marcoux, vice president of the statewide association representing sheriffs, said last week he needed to learn more about the program before he could say whether he or his counterparts could take on the additional work. He said conversations about the program seemed like a priority for the state transportation agency. 
Sheriff’s departments already partner with state agencies for some jobs, such as transporting youth who are in the custody of the Department for Children and Families, he said.
However, he continued, “the state police don’t have a monopoly on the staffing issues. You know, I’m short people. And every sheriff’s department is short people.”
Morrison, in testimony to the Legislature earlier this year, suggested lawmakers could also find a way to reconstitute the program so police don’t need to be involved at all. One option could be having the company the state chooses to operate the camera system issue fines to violators, itself, she said. 
Flynn said his agency was working on bill language it could bring to the Legislature for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January, to amend the program. In the meantime, he said the state would “plus-up” the number of officers stationed around work zones who would be tasked, specifically, with pulling over speeders.
Rep. Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House transportation committee, said he would consider any new language the agency presents next year. He said he’s concerned, however, that the timing is such that it could end up being a year from the program’s original effective date that cameras finally make it onto the roads. 
Walker said his committee did not have enough time before the end of this year’s session, which was in mid-June, to make any adjustments to the existing law. During a hearing in late April, he said that from a “sixth-grade social studies perspective,” he was frustrated the executive branch of state government wasn’t following a law the Legislature had passed a year before, regardless of what it was requiring. 
“And at the nine-plus month mark, we are finding out that it’s not going to happen,” he said at the time. “So that is a little bit frustrating.”
Walker’s counterpart in the Senate, Lamoille County Republican Richard Westman, said he also had concerns about the timing of the program, but noted the program has been a larger priority for the House. The Senate Transportation Committee chair said the state transportation agency was short-staffed and has challenges of its own. 
Pouech, the House transportation ranking member, had stronger words. 
“It passed. The governor signed it, and now they’re sitting on their hands,” he said. “I feel bad for the people who work out there. … We have a speeding problem all over the state, and here is a chance to do something about the construction zones.”
A need for more enforcement is what concerns Cloud, the longtime Green Mountain Flagging employee, the most. He said the state has already tried other solutions, like public service campaigns using digital billboards. None of those efforts seemed to have meaningfully changed drivers’ behavior, he said.
He does not think the cameras are the only solution to make drivers more aware of workers on the road, “but it’s got to start somewhere,” he said. 
“If it’s time for some enforcement, then it’s time for enforcement,” Cloud said. “Something has to make them pay attention.”

Reporting Highlights

Paid to Stay: In some of the most flood- and drought-prone parts of the country, subsidies are keeping farmers on land that is no longer productive.
In Dogtooth Bend: One family couldn’t afford to leave their failing land, so they kept planting fields to collect federally subsidized insurance. “It was a nightmare.”
Trump Doubles Down: This year’s budget bill expanded farm support. But the Trump administration cut employees who manage programs that could help pull troubled farmland out of production.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The seed tractor sank again, no surprise to Steve Williams. Everything sank out here on Dogtooth Bend in Southern Illinois since the floodwaters ran through five years earlier and dumped millions of tons of sand. The ground looked firm, but deep pockets of sticky mud lurked under the sun-cracked surface, pulling him under without warning.
He hit the gas. His wheels spun in place; sand flew. A few cuss words, too.
He called his daughter, Brandy Renshaw, working a nearby stretch of field in a giant green rig. She turned his way to pull him out; then she sank, too. Williams, in a faded plaid shirt, gray hair sprouting from under a John Deere hat, paced. Renshaw slammed the gearshift, rocked back and forth, and eventually clawed her way out.
It was June 2024, and both father and daughter knew the land they were trying to farm wasn’t going to yield much, even if they got the seeds in the ground. But this had become their routine: farming futile land just to keep from going under. For years now, they’d had one foot stuck in the mud, the other in government bureaucracy. They’d get angry — then laugh.
“What else could you do?” said Williams, 70. “We were left holding the bag.”
In these Mississippi River bottoms, federal farm policy became a trap. Farming is one of the most heavily subsidized industries in America. Each year, Congress allocates billions to keep crops in the ground, cushioning the blow from droughts, floods, fires and market swings — a safety net that dates to the 1930s, when the Depression and Dust Bowl put the nation’s food supply at risk.
But today, in some of the most flood- and drought-prone parts of the country, those programs can also keep people hanging on, even when it makes more sense to walk away. That’s increasingly clear along parts of the Mississippi River Valley and especially here in Alexander County, at the rural tip of Illinois. As the climate changes and as aging levees fail, the risk is becoming more predictable, the losses so frequent it is clear some land will no longer yield what it used to.
But the federal programs that support those changes — enacted first by President George H.W. Bush, then expanded by President Bill Clinton — have been small, slow and ineffective. After the 2019 flood — when the Mississippi River submerged the southernmost corner of Illinois for months, part of a widespread disaster across the Midwest — Congress allocated only about $217 million spread across 11 states to pay farmers to voluntarily retire their flood-ravaged fields.
Federal workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which ran the program, specifically urged farmers at Dogtooth Bend to sign up. The floods had come here repeatedly and had worsened since they busted through the 17-mile levee that protected Williams’ farmland three years earlier. So Williams signed up, along with about 30 others on Dogtooth Bend, finally ready to call mercy to the river. He offered up roughly 1,200 acres; the federal government offered to pay him about $3,200 an acre to put permanent easements on his land, which he could use for recreational purposes but never farm again.
At the time Williams applied, the program had been offered only one other time in the past decade to farmers along the Upper Mississippi River, despite billions in lost crops. And this time around, the pot — just 1% of the $19 billion disaster aid package — wasn’t big enough to help everyone who applied, especially along this corn- and soy-growing region. And even for those who were accepted, the agency in charge couldn’t keep up with the paperwork, making the process stretch on for years.
The process dragged through the rest of President Donald Trump’s first term and through most of President Joe Biden’s. And now these programs look even less certain as Trump and Republicans in Congress double down on the status quo: expanding crop insurance and farm income supports through the budget bill signed into law on July 4 while — in an effort to trim the federal workforce — gutting the staff responsible for responding to climate disasters, including those who manage permanent easements that pull troubled farmland out of production.
While farmers have struggled to access funds to help them get off flood-prone land, federal programs to keep their crops in the ground have long been the safer bet. Over the past three decades, Illinois has received $35 billion in farm support — more than any state but Texas and Iowa — mostly through insurance subsidies and price supports for growing corn and soybeans. Some of that bounty is grown on flood-prone ground along the Mississippi and other river bottoms.
“At some point in time, don’t you ask yourself: Is this really economically the best way to spend our taxpayer dollars,” said Dave Hiatt, an easement coordinator and biologist with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, “or would it serve us better in the long run if we spent money to take that ground out of production?”
Hiatt is among the USDA employees on paid leave through September as part of the Trump administration’s plan to reduce the federal workforce.
ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois reached out to the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service on Aug. 15 with a detailed list of questions about how it handled the Dogtooth Bend easements across multiple administrations as well as its priorities going forward. The agency said it was working on a response but did not provide it in time for publication or specify a day when it would respond.
While Williams waited for the buyout to go through, his bills didn’t stop. He still owed a mortgage to the bank, taxes to the county. That left him and Renshaw with a choice: Either do nothing and watch their farm operation go under, or do what they’d always done. Even when it didn’t make sense anymore, they had planted their fields to maintain their federally backed crop insurance. Keeping that crop insurance allowed them to access other agriculture subsidies and disaster aid.
So they mounted their tractors and rolled out to their nearly barren fields.
“You can’t afford to leave it,” Renshaw said. “So we planted what we could and insured everything we could. It was a nightmare.”
It hadn’t always been like this. For decades, this Delta-like sliver of bottomland jutting into the Mississippi River at Illinois’ southern edge was “the garden spot of the county,” as Williams put it. He grew up farming alongside his dad and bought his first property on the peninsula in 1987.
At that point, the land on the flood-prone bend was still protected by the Len Small Levee, built in 1943 and named for an Illinois governor. The water broke through the first time in 1993, then again in 2011. But everyone recognized its days were numbered, and the state and federal government started paying people for their homes and businesses so they could move from harm’s way. That mitigated the risk, but it also meant that after floodwaters cut a nearly mile-wide hole in 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declined to cover the $16 million repair cost: With fewer people living there, the cost-benefit formula showed it wasn’t worth saving anymore.
Williams and the other farmers were devastated: When the levee was in place, Dogtooth Bend stayed relatively dry even when the Mississippi climbed well past flood stage — 33 feet at the nearby Thebes gauge. Since the breach, water spills into the peninsula every time the river nears that mark, and that happens often now, sometimes for weeks at a time.
As hopes of a levee repair fizzled, farmers were stranded. The federal easement program receives only sporadic funding, and typically only after a presidential disaster declaration, which Illinois didn’t get in 2016, despite widespread damage in Alexander County.
Predictably, Dogtooth Bend flooded again in 2017 and 2018.
Both years, from his office three hours away near Champaign, Hiatt and a small team of federal officials with the Natural Resources Conservation Service scrambled to come up with easement funds, even outside of a disaster declaration.
“We begged, we pleaded with headquarters,” Hiatt said. “We said, ‘We need these funds right now. These people have been this poorly impacted.’”
Federal records show that after floods in both years, Hiatt and his colleagues in Illinois proposed buying out up to 11,500 acres owned by 40 or so landowners on Dogtooth Bend over time, starting with the most severely damaged. The first phase would cost $20 million and was projected to prevent $60 million in near-term damages. The proposal laid out a strong case: Roads were threatened; habitat was disappearing; land was becoming more and more degraded. Thousands of acres had already become unfarmable — and while the reports also weighed the option of restoring the land, they noted that the farmland would never be fully productive, and the costs to keep bailing out farmers would only grow.
By this point, Trump had taken office for the first time, bringing in new USDA leadership. In both 2017 and 2018, Hiatt said, agency leadership in Washington rejected the requests by him and his colleagues in Illinois to help move farmers off the land. This wasn’t unusual: According to one nonprofit’s report, over 25 years, 90% of landowners in the Upper Mississippi states who applied for funding were turned down.
Environmental groups support paying farmers to leave flood-prone land because floodwater that spreads across farm fields washes fertilizer, pesticides and other chemicals into rivers, causing a range of down-river harms. But there’s an economic argument, too: A 2019 study in the science journal Nature Sustainability found that every $1 spent restoring floodplains by clearing them of development and farms can save at least $5 in future damages.
Despite this, the single largest agriculture program in the farm bill is intended to keep people on the land. That comes in the form of crop insurance premiums, an average of 60% of which are paid by the federal government.
In Alexander County, that is closer to 70%. More broadly, the costs of keeping people on their land there were spiraling upward: In addition to subsidies, there were millions more to clean up flood debris, shore up the levees, and fix roads and drainage systems. And still the floods kept coming.
Yet farmers were still planting. “They do the math,” said Silvia Secchi, a farm policy expert at the University of Iowa, about why farmers might keep investing in troubled land. “You and I would do the same math. If you want to stay in business, you do what makes you stay in business.”
For the father-daughter team of Williams and Renshaw, it was barely enough. “All the insurance did was keep people from going broke,” Williams said.
“You aren’t winning,” Renshaw added, “by any means.”
By the time the historic flood hit in 2019, the need to rescue the farmers at Dogtooth Bend was undeniable.
When the river finally pulled back, Williams no longer recognized the land he’d spent his life working. The levee breach had let the full force of the Mississippi pour through Dogtooth Bend for five months. It carved new channels, dumped dunes of sand and even sucked six barges off the main river and left two stranded in a field. People compared the scene to Mars. To the windswept dunes of “Lawrence of Arabia.” To Williams, it was “just a sickening feeling.”
Farmers in Alexander County claimed more than $7 million in crop insurance payouts that year — the highest on record. Roads were so mangled they had to be fully rebuilt. Trash and driftwood littered the peninsula. The damage made the case for a buyout harder to ignore.
If that case weren’t strong enough, the flood also put on display the benefits of letting the levee go. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ decision not to fix it had hurt the nearby farmers, allowing the water to spread out in Dogtooth Bend may have helped relieve pressure on the levee system across the river in Missouri and downriver.
Williams and Renshaw had come to terms with what that meant. Their land had been sacrificed so others’ could be spared. When Williams signed up for the floodplain easement program in August 2019, he figured he’d never farm Dogtooth Bend again. By that point, only about 200 of their 1,200 acres could still grow a crop. “But do it right,” Renshaw said. Instead, they fell into a broken system that left them farming nearly useless land while they waited five years for the federal government to complete their easement paperwork.
Williams knew the government moved slowly, but his first year’s wait seemed absurd. By year two, he’d nearly given up. By the summer of 2024, he was just plain disgusted. He checked in regularly with federal workers, calling the local officials he knew by name on their cellphones or popping into the local office in nearby Tamms. But the federal workers on the ground couldn’t tell him much other than his paperwork was still in process, under review with a federal official somewhere in another state thousands of miles from Dogtooth Bend. They were frustrated, too.
Danette Cross, who worked for the Natural Resources Conservation Service office in Alexander County until her retirement late last year, said most of the farmers knew her by name and often called her directly, expecting she’d have answers. But to get anything resolved, Cross had to run questions up a chain through a half-dozen people. “I’m not going to say the whole thing was a disaster — they closed on a lot of easements,” she said, “but nothing was timely.”
Hiatt, who had failed twice before to bring in funds for these farmers, tried again in 2019, this time banking their hopes on the emergency aid Congress had earmarked for the program. Hiatt said the Illinois team requested $24 million to buy out everyone who signed up at Dogtooth Bend. The payments are not full market value but allow farmers to invest in drier fields that would be less costly to the federal government in the long run.
But headquarters authorized just under $6 million, which it applied to the very worst fields. Williams’ land was hit hard, but it didn’t make the cut. That meant crop insurance and the other safety net farm bill programs would have to sustain him while he waited.
This wasn’t the only holdup. In 2018, Hiatt said, the agency had created a national team to handle land deals in an effort to improve efficiency. But he said it backfired.
“We were acquiring easements in 500 days” when the Illinois office handled the process on its own, he said. “Now we’ve got this specialized team — they’re taking 800. The math is not working there.”
The head of USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which oversees the crop insurance program, made a personal visit to the wreckage after the floodwaters receded in 2019. Martin Barbre, who led the agency for most of Trump’s first term, knew the area well. He grew up visiting his relatives nearby and himself farms just 100 miles away. In a recent interview, Barbre said he empathized with the farmers and wanted to ensure they got everything they were legally owed through crop insurance.
“I mean, you’ve farmed that ground your whole life. Your family’s owned it for, you know, probably for generations, and here it’s just gone,” Barbre said. He didn’t fault the farmers who kept planting while they waited for a federal buyout. “As long as they’re insured, they have the legal right to do that,” he said. “When I was administrator, I had a saying: ‘I want a producer to get every dime he’s got coming from the program — but not a penny more.’”
In 2020, the USDA leadership released additional funding to purchase easements on Dogtooth Bend. Williams bounced between the two programs. Each required new paperwork — and more time.
In 2021, at a meeting in Olive Branch, Hiatt faced frustrated farmers. “I took a beating,” he said. “And I was glad to take it, because it was poorly administered.”
Three more years passed, and no check had arrived for Williams. But the bills still did.
Although it could barely grow a thing, the county still taxed Williams’ land on Dogtooth Bend like it was prime ground — nearly $40,000 a year, according to Williams, calculated in part on farm productivity from across the state. That number would rise in each subsequent year, including on fields buried under 20 feet of sand. That’s because the rate wouldn’t change until the buyout went through and it was officially classified as conservation land.
As one of the poorest and fastest-shrinking places in America, Alexander County — population 4,600 — leans on farmers like Williams to fund basic government services and keep teachers employed in a school district with just over 300 kids. Farming in Alexander County accounts for $1 in every $7 in the local economy. And as more people move out of the county, there are fewer left to shoulder the tax burden.
Sean Pecord, who farmed on Dogtooth Bend not far from Williams, was one of the first to sign up for the buyout program in 2019; his land was the worst hit. “There was nothing left of it to farm,” he said.
“They work at their own pace,” said Pecord, who along with his wife also runs the nearby Horseshoe Bar and Grill. “If they were operating on normal business terms, they’d be bankrupt in a year.”
Pecord received his payment in late 2023, about four years after he signed up. Williams was finally paid last September. “It’s not what they did,” Williams said of the federal government. “It’s how long they took to do it.”
G. Pang, who lives in nearby Missouri and owns land on Dogtooth Bend with her six siblings, said they’re still waiting to get paid — and for answers. She used to call Hiatt’s personal cellphone when she wanted a status update. But today, the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has been hollowed out, with some 2,400 conservation staffers at home on paid leave through September under the terms of the federal buyout, according to a May report by Politico. Hiatt and his two federal colleagues who oversaw easement purchases in Illinois are among them, as are nearly half the staff of 30 who had been tasked with handling back-end easement paperwork as part of the agency’s national land team.
“Just going in there, taking a chainsaw, removing people and not knowing who you’re going to replace them with, you’re just creating a mess,” Pang said of staff cuts under Trump that have left her family in the dark.
Without the experienced staff, closing on these deals will take even longer, if it happens at all, Hiatt said.
“What’s happening now will never be reversed,” Hiatt said. “Once this is broken, which I don’t know if the break is complete yet, but it’s pretty fractured, I don’t think you can reset that bone.”
Several who joined the buyout were in their 70s and 80s. “They were devastated,” Renshaw recalled.
Williams’ health has deteriorated in the last few years. Macular degeneration has claimed much of his eyesight. Although he’s nearing retirement, he didn’t expect to go out like this.
One of the advertised benefits of the buyout program was that he could take the money and use it to buy farmland elsewhere. But by the time he had his check in hand and was ready to close on new land this year in Alexander County, prices had soared. That means the amount of money he agreed to when he signed on can no longer buy what he’d planned to use it for.
Williams is locked in to the 2020 rate, which is 50% lower than the maximum the government is paying today. If Williams had entered the program today, his land would be worth roughly $2 million more than he agreed to take.
“We could take two acres of that money and buy us an acre up here,” he said. “Now,” he said, “it takes at least three acres of that money to buy an acre up here.”
Part of him regrets signing the papers. The other part knows he didn’t have a choice.
“That monster is still down there,” he said of the river. “It will be back.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8677-700x350-1.jpg,,,2025-09-09 14:57:52.858933

(Getty Images)Indiana University is once again among the worst colleges in the country for free speech, according to a new report released Tuesday by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.
The group’s 2026 College Free Speech Rankings placed IU in the bottom three out of 257 schools surveyed. 
FIRE, a nonprofit civil liberties organization that advocates for academic freedom and free speech, annually surveys college undergraduates nationwide about perceptions of their First Amendment Rights on campuses.
The new report placed IU at No. 255 with an overall score of 43.87 — out of 100 — and a failing grade of F. Only Barnard College and Columbia University ranked as poorly.
Story continues below.
2026 College Free Speech Rankings Report
 
In contrast, Purdue University placed second overall, with a score of 76.24 and a speech climate grade of C. DePauw University also ranked in the top 20 nationally, finishing 18th with a score of 71.13 and a grade of C-.
The University of Notre Dame fell in the bottom half of the rankings at No. 238, with a score of 50.42 and a failing grade.
A ‘chilling effect’ on IU’s campus
FIRE officials said in a news release that the lowest-rated schools “are home to restrictive speech policies and some of last year’s most shocking anti-free speech moments.” 
The report singled out IU for what FIRE called a “visible force and invisible voices” chilling effect. 
FIRE pointed to events on IU’s campus last spring as a major driver of its poor ranking. 
Administrators adopted a new policy banning the construction of unauthorized structures in a late-night meeting — just hours before students began setting up a pro-Palestinian encampment. The following day, the university called in state police, who placed snipers on the roof of the student union. 
IU protests and police action draw criticism, defense

“The incident sparked widespread concern among students, contributing to IU’s poor performance in this year’s rankings,” the FIRE report noted.
Roughly a third of IU students said they self-censor in conversations with peers, professors and in classroom discussions, and a majority additionally reported feeling “uncomfortable expressing their views on a controversial political topic” either in class or in a public campus space like the quad, dining hall or lounge, according to the report.
Student survey responses described fear of administrative retaliation. 
One IU student said, “Our administration at Indiana University has publicly and repeatedly silenced students that speak out on controversial topics. I am afraid that I would get retaliation from the administration in terms of a lawsuit, a ban from campus, and expulsion from the university.”
IU also performed poorly across FIRE’s subcategories: 251st on administrative support, 255th on openness, 246th on self-censorship, and 227th on comfort expressing ideas.
Only 23% of IU students said it is “very” or “extremely” clear that the administration protects free speech, while nearly half said administrators were “not at all” or “not very” likely to defend a speaker’s rights during a controversy.
Other Indiana schools
The rankings are based on surveys of more than 68,000 students across the country. FIRE’s new report showed that 166 of the 257 schools surveyed got an F for their speech climate, while only 11 schools received a speech climate grade of C or higher.
It’s not the first time IU has landed near the bottom of the annual free speech census. Last year, the Bloomington school ranked 243rd out of 251, also near the bottom. Before that, in 2024, IU ranked 225th.
Nationally, Purdue University fared far better in the latest report than its in-state counterpart. 
FIRE ranked the West Lafayette flagship campus second in the country this year, behind only Claremont McKenna College. Other top-ranked schools included the University of Chicago and Michigan Technological University.
Other Indiana institutions were not included in the 2026 report. 
Last year, DePauw University placed 36th and the University of Notre Dame 167th. Purdue was also in the top 30.

Bills creating a gerrymandered congressional map and making it virtually impossible to change the state constitution through the initiative petition process are on their way to the Missouri Senate.
The Missouri House gave final approval to both proposals Tuesday after two days of contentious debate. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe called the legislature back into session after weeks of pressure from the President Donald Trump for GOP-run states to redraw congressional districts to ensure more Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. 
In Missouri, the effort targeted the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, by carving it up and dispersing its voters into three districts that give Republicans an electoral advantage in seven of the state’s eight congressional districts. 
“This is a superior map,” said state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican sponsoring the proposed new congressional map. “It better represents the state of Missouri.”

In addition to the gerrymandered map, Republicans also took aim at the citizen initiative petition process. The House approved a plan Tuesday that would require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by Missouri voters to attain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts in order to pass. 
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The proposal would also ban foreign contributions to initiative petition campaigns, something that is already illegal. 
If it passes the Senate, the issue would go on the statewide ballot in 2026 and require a simple majority to approve. 
State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican, said amending the state constitution has become too easy and has been dominated by out-of-state interests. His proposal, he said, would address both of those issues. 
“There should be a broad consensus across the state to amend the constitution,” he said. 
Democrats denounced both of the proposals as a power grab by the Republican supermajority and a Trump-inspired assault on democracy. 
“The Missouri GOP is aiding and abetting the systematic destruction of our democracy by an authoritarian regime led by geriatric conman who knows the only way he can win is to cheat,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat.
GOP state Rep. Bryant Wolfin of Ste. Genevieve was one of the few Republicans who voted against both measures, saying this week’s special session proves that the only thing that matters in the Missouri Capitol is “political power.”
“Unfortunately, it’s not ethics,” he said. “It’s not morality. It’s definitely not liberty. It’s just political power.”
If Democrats were in charge, Wolfin, said, he’s sure they would do the same thing. But that doesn’t justify what Republicans are doing.
“There’s certainly nothing conservative about ignoring the moral implications of our actions,” he said. “Morality is not defined by what is legal. Morality is not defined by what you can get away with.”
 Gerrymandering

Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times. 
Democrats argue it is unconstitutional to draw another map before the next census is complete. 
The Missouri NAACP filed a lawsuit last week in Cole County arguing the governor’s decision to call a special session was unconstitutional. Cleaver has also promised to go to court to challenge any gerrymandered map lawmakers approve.
But Republicans say critics are misreading the constitution and are confident the new map would survive a legal challenge. 
“The constitution is clear that we can alter districts as we desire at any point at any point,” Deaton said. 
Legislators were elected to represent the people, Deaton said, and if a majority of legislators vote in support of the map “that’s representative democracy.”

The new map does not include an emergency clause that would have made it go into effect upon Kehoe’s signature. That means opponents of the map will have 90s days after it is signed into law to collect signatures to force a statewide vote. 
St. Louis Public Radio reported Monday that the Missouri AFL-CIO is considering whether to launch a petition drive to force a referendum vote. If enough signatures are gathered before the law takes effect, it would be held in abeyance until after the vote.
That strategy was last deployed in 2018, when labor unions collected more than 300,000 signatures in 90 days — more than three times the amount needed — to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law. 
The repeal push was ultimately successful, with 67% of voters rejecting the right-to-work law. 
In fact, of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
 Constitutional amendments

Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot. 
Missourians in recent years have used the initiative petition process to legalize abortion and recreational marijuana use, as well expand Medicaid eligibility. 
In November, the abortion-rights amendment passed with just shy of 52% of the vote driven by large support from the state’s urban, more-populated areas. Voters in all but eight of Missouri’s 115 counties opposed the amendment.
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

Lewis argued Tuesday that the process is dominated by liberal, out-of-state organizations who are pushing partisan amendments that would be impossible to pass through the Republican-dominated legislature. 
“Do you want partisan things going into the constitution,” Lewis said, “or do we want something that a broad consensus of all Missourians could support.”
State Rep. Martin Jacobs, a Democrat from Liberty, questioned why the process should be changed to allow a fraction of voters to sink an initiative petition, arguing it violates the principle of one person, one vote. 
“Voters in one district can override voters of every other district,” Jacobs said. 
Based on last year’s general election, where 2,960,266 votes were cast for governor and only 311,915 in the 1st District, under the proposed change only 156,000 voters could defeat ballot question — or just shy of 5.3% of the statewide vote.
The GOP-backed legislation “rigs the system,” said Democratic state Rep. Kathey Steinhoof of Columbia, “and I assure you all Missourians on both sides of the aisle are tired of the system being rigged.”
 On to the Senate

Both bills now head to the Missouri Senate, where Democrats are expected to use the filibuster and other procedural maneuvers to gum up legislative business as much as possible. 
In order to overcome the gridlock, Senate Republicans may once again have to break a filibuster and force a vote by turning to a rule that was previously rarely-used but got deployed twice during the regular legislative session in May. 
Doing so would create even more bad blood in a legislative chamber already teetering on the edge of full on partisan collapse. It could also upend the 2026 session before it even gets started. 
Republican leaders in the Senate are determined to push both measures across the finish line. 
“The map and the initiative petition reform measures will strike a huge blow to progressives and their efforts to turn Missouri into California,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, posted on social media. “We are not California. We are not progressives.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/54521302847_26a750e7d0_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

(Arielle Zionts/KFF Health News)BOWMAN, N.D. — Retta Jacobi stepped onto a metal platform that lifted her to an entrance on the side of a custom-designed semitrailer. Once inside, she lay down on a platform that technicians slid into an MRI machine. Jacobi hoped the scan would help pinpoint the source of the pain in her shoulders.
The mobile MRI unit visits Southwest Healthcare Services, the hospital in Bowman, North Dakota, each Wednesday. Without it, the community’s 1,400 residents would have to drive 40 minutes to get to an MRI machine, an expensive piece of medical equipment the hospital couldn’t afford on its own.
Southwest Healthcare Services and 21 other independent, rural North Dakota hospitals are part of the Rough Rider Network, which used its members’ combined patient rolls to negotiate better prices for the mobile imaging truck.
Independent rural hospitals are increasingly joining what are called clinically integrated networks, collaborative groups that allow them to avoid selling out to larger health systems while sharing resources to save money and improve patient care. Many are motivated by the chance to combine their patient rolls for value-based care contracts, a growing reimbursement model in which insurers pay providers based on the quality of care they provide and the health outcomes of their patients.
Supporters of the networks are exploring whether funding from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — part of President Donald Trump’s recent tax and spending bill — can be used to help start or expand such organizations.

For independent, rural hospitals, the networks are an alternative to shutting down or reducing services, or to giving up local autonomy and joining a large hospital system.
“Anything that can help our rural hospitals and add services is awesome,” said Jacobi, who provides speech therapy to children in the local school district.
Since 2010, 153 rural hospitals in the U.S. have shuttered completely or stopped offering inpatient services, according to the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. A far larger number, 441, merged with or were acquired by hospital systems between 2011 and 2021. That’s according to a report commissioned by the Coalition to Strengthen America’s Healthcare, an advocacy group comprising hospitals and health associations.
The Rough Rider Network provides negotiating leverage to its members, which serve about two-thirds of rural North Dakotans, said Dennis Goebel, CEO of the Bowman hospital.
Health care vendors “probably wouldn’t be talking to us if we’re by ourselves,” he said. “They’re not looking for the little, tiny crumbs. They want a big contract, and they’ll give you better pricing.”
Some rural networks share specialists who aren’t needed full time at any one hospital, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit focused on improving the health care system. Some networks also invest in broadband, housing, and other community development projects that can help people stay healthy and access care.
Hospitals can pool staffers for a network-wide employee health insurance plan, said Nathan White, CEO of Cibolo Health, a company that helps launch and manage networks in rural areas. He said they can also enter shared contracts for telehealth, prescription drug programs, and other services.
White said he started Cibolo Health after a leader from an independent, rural North Dakota hospital asked him about collaborating with similar facilities. The Rough Rider Network launched in late 2023 with assistance from the company and $3.5 million from the North Dakota Legislature.
Since then, Cibolo Health has helped start networks in Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, and Ohio. Once a sixth one opens in September, Cibolo-affiliated networks will represent more than 120 hospitals, with service areas covering 4.7 million people, White said.
The networks, which are nonprofits owned by the hospitals, pay an annual fee to Cibolo Health, a for-profit company, for management services. White said leaders from 10 other states are considering joining this model.
Similar networks have been around for more than 30 years but became more popular after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, according to a report by the Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.
Rural health care providers are increasingly interested in forming such networks, said Marnell Bradfield, executive director of the Community Care Alliance, a network of hospitals and independent primary care offices that launched in 2015 in rural western Colorado. About once a month, she said, she gets a call from health care leaders exploring similar networks and asking about her experience.

The Rand Corp. wrote in its 2020 paper that it didn’t find any academic studies that examined whether these networks do what its supporters claim — save money and improve patient care.
“In theory, quality should improve with the alignment of health care organizations, but there is no evidence,” the report said. The paper also said such networks could end up increasing prices, something that can occur with traditional mergers and acquisitions.
Bradfield and White said they have the evidence, at least for their organizations.
Community Care Alliance members have reduced their insurance costs while improving patient outcomes, such as reducing their need for inpatient and emergency care, Bradfield said.
White said data from a pilot program between Caret Health, a care coordination company, and SMP Health-St. Kateri, one of Rough Rider’s hospitals, showed the program helped a significant number of patients catch up with preventive care.
Gabby Wilkie, finance director at the St. Kateri hospital, in Rolla near the Canadian border, said Caret Health staff called and texted patients who were behind on annual physicals, cancer screenings, vaccinations, and other visits. She said staffers explained to patients why this preventive care is important for their health before setting up a three-way call with St. Kateri staff to schedule an appointment. White said it took an average of 11 outreach attempts before patients came in for any visits.
“To be honest, we didn’t have the resources to reach out,” Wilkie said.
She said St. Kateri would have spent an estimated $300,000 to do that kind of outreach for 1,000 patients. Meanwhile, she said, the hospital estimates it will earn more than $100,000 when that many patients come in for their preventive care. Cibolo Health and the Rough Rider Network both contribute to the cost of the Caret Health service, which is now rolling out to other network hospitals.
Goebel said joining a network to remain independent is also beneficial for the economy of rural areas, where hospitals are often major employers. He said health systems sometimes cut services and staff at rural hospitals they acquire.
Jacobi is taking medication and doing physical therapy after a doctor examined her MRI results. If that doesn’t work, she may need to make a five-hour round trip to Bismarck to get an ultrasound-guided steroid shot. Jacobi was thankful she could get a diagnosis and treatment advice without having to travel far for the MRI.
“Anytime we can maintain more local control, it’s a good thing for our small towns,” she said.

(Photo courtesy Bureau of Reclamation)Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation are urging Republican leaders to prioritize the funding of tribal water settlements, even as President Donald Trump is proposing little to no funding to honor the nation’s longstanding treaty obligations.
State agencies request advance funding for pending Tribal water settlements

In a letter to House and Senate leaders last week, New Mexico’s delegation — all Democrats — and their Republican colleagues in Montana called on House and Senate leadership to prioritize the passage of 10 water settlements, six of which are in New Mexico.
“Completion of these settlements will save taxpayers millions of dollars, provide water access and certainty to Tribal and non-Tribal water users across the West, avoid years of protracted and costly litigation, and support the United States’ trust responsibility to Tribes,” the members of Congress wrote in the Sept. 4 letter.
The letter notes that the settlements have “robust support” and have passed a Senate Committee and received a hearing in a House committee. But Congress has otherwise taken little action on them since members introduced the settlements in February, according to a congressional bill tracker.
New Mexico entered into five settlement agreements in 2022 with the Pueblos of Acoma, Laguna, Jemez and Zia, the Navajo Nation, Zuni Tribe and Ohkay Owingeh. 


The six tribal settlements in New Mexico:

 S.637/H.R.1482 – Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project Amendments Act
 S.562/H.R.1322 – Rio San José and Rio Jemez Water Settlements Act
 S.563/H.R.1323 – Ohkay Owingeh Rio Chama Water Rights Settlement Act
 S.564/H.R.1444 – Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act
 S.565/H.R.1324 – Navajo Nation Rio San José Stream System Water Rights Settlement Act
S.640/H.R.4598– Technical Corrections to the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act



The New Mexico delegation subsequently introduced legislation to approve the deals, including approximately $3 billion to establish funds and build infrastructure. The settlements, which have required years and sometimes decades of costly negotiations, would settle tribal rights for the San José, Jemez, Chama and Zuni rivers.
Two other bills would correct technical errors in established Tribal water settlements and add an extension of both time and money to complete the long-delayed Navajo-Gallup water project. Federal funding granted the project a short reprieve, but it faces an upcoming deadline only Congress can delay.
The Navajo-Gallup project is the most expensive of the projects, with additional pending costs that Congress will need to approve. 
However, President Donald Trump’s budget proposal does not include the roughly $175 million needed for the Navajo-Gallup project. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján recently chastised a federal Interior Department official over the lack of funding, saying failure to pay for the pipeline would be the nation’s first-ever violation of a tribal water treaty.
The Interior Department’s budget request for the fiscal year beginning in October seeks Congressional approval of just $4 million for the Navajo-Gallup project, and it’s one of only two tribal water rights settlements to get any proposed funding, according to the budget request. 
The letter calls on House and Senate leaders to extend the use of Customs User Fees, which the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol collects from international arrivals, to fund the settlements. Congress in 2010 funded four tribal settlements with the use of those fees, the letter notes, adding, “We urge you to consider prior precedent to offset the cost of these proposed settlements and appreciate your consideration.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-29-at-1.46.22-PM-1024x453.png,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

Democratic Rep. Dina Titus, whose congressional district has the state’s highest share of public transit users, introduced a bill Monday that would allow transit agencies to add extra buses to their fleets to prevent disruptions to service during extreme heat events.
Las Vegas needs more spare buses, a federal rule prevents it

The Bus Utilization for Fleet Flexibility and Emergency Resilience (BUFFER) Act would allow transit agencies to increase their spare bus ratio to 30% of their fleet without jeopardizing federal grants if their region regularly experiences extreme weather events.
The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC), which manages more than 400 buses, has struggled to maintain fleet availability due to more frequent service outages brought on by the region’s extreme heat and high transit demand.
Buses in southern Nevada also experience rapid wear-and tear due to long operation hours and a regular influx of millions of tourists a year.
Several bus routes in Las Vegas operate 24 hours a day to accommodate tourism and a non-traditional workforce that requires constant access to public transportation.
“In Southern Nevada and elsewhere, extreme heat takes its toll not only on buses but on the passengers who ride them,” Titus said in a statement. “My legislation will allow the RTC and other transit agencies to increase the number of spare buses they can put into service during bus breakdowns, including those due to extreme heat.”
“Eighty percent of our transit riders rely on buses to get to work and back. Reliable transportation service is critical to both their health and their livelihoods,” she continued.
Transit agencies that go over the spare bus cap risk losing certain federal grants if they aren’t granted an exemption from the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) for additional spare buses. However, the federal agency has never granted a waiver for additional buses to any state.
The bill would create a clear path for exemptions by requiring the FTA to issue regulations and guidance for transit agencies that want to request an increase in the number of spare buses they can have in their fleet. 
Under the bill, transit agencies would need to submit a certification that their region regularly experiences extreme weather events, a description of how extreme weather events disrupt bus operations, and an explanation of how the increase would ensure reliable service. 
Federal funds cover a majority of the expense it takes to purchase a new bus – up to 90% for low or no emissions buses –  through competitive grants, including the Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program. But the cap on spare buses can limit how a transit agency can use those funds for their needs.
Southern Nevada is not alone. Several transit agencies with high-frequency and high-intensity service – especially in regions that are tourism and live entertainment hubs – have reported operational challenges related to the federal cap.
A recent study by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) found that spare bus availability was a common challenge for transit agencies, impacting their ability to meet service demands.
More than 40% of surveyed agencies reported bus availability problems at least a few times per month. A significant majority, 75%, said they believe changing the FTA’s spare ratio policy would greatly improve vehicle availability.
The RTC, which participated in the survey, emphasized that a major challenge for the agency is maintaining a sufficient spare vehicle ratio to meet operational needs.
High transit demand and the extreme desert climate in Las Vegas leads to rapid wear and tear on buses, said the agency, especially for high-mileage buses operating on super heated roads for long hours. Las Vegas roads can reach temperatures of more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, said the RTC.
The adoption of electric buses has also created unique challenges. In the survey, the RTC noted that summer heat can also accelerate the deterioration of batteries in electric buses, increasing maintenance needs and causing downtime, which reduces the fleet’s availability.
“The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada strongly supports revisiting the 20 percent spare ratio policy,” said MJ Maynard-Carey, RTC CEO. “In a region experiencing rapid growth, extreme weather, and large-scale events, added flexibility will help us keep our community moving. Updating this policy will ensure we can continue providing safe, reliable service for the thousands of riders who count on us each day.”
Last week, Southern Nevada’s congressional delegation sent a letter to the FTA asking the federal agency to remove or increase its cap on the number of spare buses transit agencies can own.
“Las Vegas’s vibrant tourism economy depends on reliable transit service to transport millions of visitors, not just year-round residents, especially during major events such as the Super Bowl, Formula 1 Grand Prix, FIFA tournaments, and large concerts,” wrote the delegation.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rtcbuses-1024x570.jpg,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-09 17:33:44+00:00,Mississippi Today,A new home for Mississippi writers on William Faulkner’s old mule farm,Adam Ganucheau,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/09/greenfield-farm-writers-residency/,"Plans for the Greenfield Farm Writers Residency, a retreat-style home for 40-50 writers per year on William Faulkner's old mule farm in north Mississippi, are moving forward.","CORNERSVILLE — It was impossible not to wonder what William Faulkner might think of what was happening on his land on a drizzly, humid Sunday last fall.
Several of Mississippi’s up-and-coming artists drew, painted and photographed the depths of the landscape around us. A saxophonist and accordionist played some folk melodies, their riffs echoing off a rotting wooden house and a scattering of oak trees. Joe Stinchcomb, one of the South’s best bartenders, slung gin cocktails from a folding table for more than 100 people who’d trekked out in their mud boots and rain jackets.
We were deep in the woods for the Plein Air Invitational, an artist showcase hosted by the University of Mississippi at Greenfield, Faulkner’s old mule farm 17 miles east of Oxford toward his hometown New Albany. This ground, though much less visited than the literary icon’s home Rowan Oak in Oxford, is sacred to those who know it.
After he sold the movie rights for his novel “The Unvanquished” in 1938, Faulkner bought 362 acres here, where generations of Faulkners and tenant families such as the McJunkinses grew cotton and corn over the years. The fields, trees and trails tucked away in these hills served as literary inspiration for many stories people now obsess over. From 1938 to 1945, when Faulkner spent much of his time at Greenfield, he worked on “The Hamlet,” “Go Down, Moses,” and “A Fable.” In “Absalom, Absalom!”, Faulkner’s map of Yoknapatawpha County placed the fictional McCallum farm on the very site of Greenfield Farm. Puskus Creek, which flows east to west through the property, became the setting for the quicksand scene in the film adaptation of “Intruder in the Dust.”
After his passing in 1962 and the changing of owners over the years, the property fell into neglect. The farm failed and went into foreclosure around 1990, when a local bank sold 20 acres of the land to the University of Mississippi. For nearly three decades in the university’s possession, the property was largely unused, save for a few field trips of the annual Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference. During this time, much of the history of the place was lost.
Sometime in 1992, Faulkner’s hunting cabin on the property burned. What remains of the farm’s structures are badly decomposing in the elements. There are no signs or markers signifying the place’s import, and there has been little reason to visit the land or even know it existed unless you knew someone who knew.
That’s all changing now. The 100 or so people who visited last fall had gathered for an art exhibition, yes. But their primary reason for coming out was not just to pay respect to the land’s importance and history, but to celebrate its future.
Attendees stood that day on the very site of what will become the Greenfield Farm Writers Residency, a retreat-style home for 40-50 writers per year. There will be a gathering lodge with offices, a library and a kitchen. Writers will have their own cabins to rest, write and focus. Overnight residents will receive a $1,000-per-week stipend.
So what would Faulkner, whose words have been parsed by generations of scholars and readers, think of all this?
“Later in his life, Faulkner advocated for solitary time and dwelled on the importance of writers having isolation and time to do their work,” said John T. Edge, the visionary and director of the Greenfield Farm Writers Residency. “We’re working intentionally to honor and build just that. A whole lot of people had planned for many years to responsibly leverage the Faulkner profile on this land to build something just like this.
“Mississippi is a state that depends on its writers, I would argue, more than any other to tell its story,” Edge continued. “So we’re going to offer Mississippians and anyone who feels some connection to Mississippi the place, the stipend, the time they need to plan, start, or finish their work.”

This project, for years just a vision and appealing concept drawn up on some fundraising material, just cleared its biggest benchmark yet.
In late August, the Institutions for Higher Learning board voted to approve the exterior design of the buildings on the property, a major step toward full approval of the construction process. Project leaders have raised $4.6 million for Greenfield Farm thus far, including a $750,000 legislative appropriation. Fundraising for additional capital costs and a separate $3 million endowment continues.
Multimillion dollar developments take time and plans often shift, but Edge said last week that project leaders hope to open the construction bid process this fall, they hope building will begin in the spring of 2026, and they hope to host a first cohort of residents in early 2027.
Several people have lent their expertise and perspectives to the project, but Edge is the leader of the endeavor. An accomplished author himself who is touring his new book ‘House of Smoke,’ Edge leads an initiative called The Mississippi Lab, a University of Mississippi-sponsored humanities laboratory for the state of Mississippi.
The idea for Greenfield Farm Writers Residency developed out of this initiative.
“I talk to a lot of writers. I claim a community of writers,” Edge said when asked about his drive for the development of Greenfield Farm. “We all ask each other, ‘Where’d you go to finish that book?’ or ‘How did you find time to write that draft?’ So many of them talk about the writers residences, trips to places like MacDowell in New Hampshire or Hedgebrook in Washington state. Beth Ann Fennelly just finished her new book ‘The Irish Goodbye’ at Loghaven just outside Knoxville. I finished my last book ‘The Potlikker Papers,’ the majority of it, at Rivendell near Sewanee. Writers of all sorts use these residencies.”
Edge is not doing this work alone. He’s leaned on a star-studded committee of advisors including Fennelly, Ralph Eubanks, Kiese Laymon, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Ebony Lumumba, and Natasha Trethewey — renowned Mississippi writers who know exactly how residencies can bolster the creative process.
“A residency gives you time away from the day-to-day,” said Eubanks, a faculty fellow and writer-in-residence at the University of Mississippi Center for the Study of Southern Culture, who finished his upcoming book “When It’s Darkness on the Delta” at a residency in Cambridge. “I didn’t have to think about meals, my job, anything other than my writing. Most of us who are doing this type of work, we take slices out of our day to keep routine going. What a residency does is pulls you out of that routine and gives you a period of intense focus. We are in a culture where time and attention are very valuable things. To have a place where you can have the time and you can devote the attention to the work is invaluable.”
The Greenfield planning group is thinking deliberately about details large and small. How should the kitchen be designed, and what types of food will be served? How much sunlight will enter the writer’s cabins during the summer, and how much shade will the property offer during the winter after the oaks have shed their leaves? What type of bed is most comfortable for rest, and where in the cabins should the reading chairs go?


The logo design for the residency features a turkey buzzard, an ode to Faulkner’s 1958 quote: “… if I were reincarnated, I’d want to come back a buzzard. Nothing hates him or envies him or wants him or needs him. He is never bothered or in danger, and he can eat anything.”
One thing that will set Greenfield apart from other writers’ residencies is the stipend for overnight residents who are selected. Edge and the advisers focused considerable attention — and are still working hard to fundraise — to this idea.
“Traditionally, residencies have been the province of the upper and upper-middle class,” Edge said. “But writers of all economic strata need access to this kind of asset. How can we make it possible for people who may not earn a lot per year but they want to take a month off to start or finish a book? To do that, they’d be giving up a huge chunk of their income and their family could suffer. So we plan to level the playing field and put a stipend in their pockets. We want anyone, regardless of their economic status, to be able to take advantage of this asset.”
And, of course, a primary focus of the project planners is Mississippi. Edge, who says University of Mississippi leaders and particularly Provost Noel Wilkin have been immensely supportive of the project, said the university will have no say in the application process.
Evidence of this full-state focus is clear even before construction begins. The Plein Air Invitational last fall was cohosted with Jackson State University, and this fall’s artist invitational on October 19 will be cohosted with Mississippi State University. Donations for the project have come from the Julia Reed Charitable Trust in Greenville, the Gertrude C. Ford Foundation in Jackson, the Robert M. Hearin Support Foundation in Jackson and numerous donors across Mississippi.
“This will be a UM asset, but it is being built to serve the entire state,” Edge said. “This will be a place of production and a place to make new content for all of Mississippi. And we’re thinking about Mississippi in the broadest kind of way. If you were born here, you’re certainly welcome. But what about someone from, say, Chicago, whose Mississippi roots go back four or five generations? Absolutely. We will open our doors to anyone who feels some connection to the state.”
One doesn’t have to be a literary buff to know that Mississippi produces more than its fair share of impactful writers. But the writers we already know aren’t the full story here, Greenfield planners say.
“We are the seat of storytellers,” Eubanks said. “But my excitement about this is it will help us really enhance the work of the next generation of our state’s storytellers. There are so many stories across this state that are buried or truly hiding in plain sight. People who want to tell those stories might not yet have found the right path to tell them. This residency could be life-changing for them and for us all.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/08101035/Screenshot-2025-09-08-at-10.10.22-AM.jpg,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Supreme Court's video)TOPEKA — The attorney for a prominent Kansas financial institution urged the Kansas Supreme Court to derail a class-action lawsuit challenging imposition of obscure bank fees and limiting to 30 days the timeframe for customers to contest transaction penalties.
A Shawnee County District Court judge granted a motion from Capitol Federal Savings Bank for dismissal of the lawsuit in October 2024. Plaintiffs Jennifer Harding and Samantha Ramirez pivoted to the Kansas Court of Appeals. The three-judge appellate panel reversed the district court after concluding “erroneous” reasoning was relied upon to dismiss breach of contract claims against Capitol Federal.
Capitol Federal, a Topeka company serving Kansas and Missouri customers and listing assets of $10 billion, filed an appeal with the state Supreme Court.
In oral argument Monday, justices and attorneys focused on whether plaintiffs should have been allowed by District Judge Merlin Wheeler to proceed to a jury trial.
The justices considered ambiguities in Capitol Federal’s fine-print document outlining the meaning of “improper charges,” which the Court of Appeals said wasn’t written in a manner to be “inherently clear.” Supreme Court justices weighed consequences of a customer overdrawing a bank account as well as obligations of customers when contesting fees imposed on account holders.
Supreme Court justices considered the appropriateness of Capitol Federal’s requirement that its customers raise concerns about potentially improper charges within 30 days of Capitol Federal sending an account statement or forever lose the right to contest the issue.
“That provision only serves a purpose of limiting Capitol Federal’s liability, right?” said Justice Dan Biles, who has served on the Supreme Court since 2009.
Justice Caleb Stegall, who was appointed in 2014 by Gov. Sam Brownback, also brought up Capitol Federal’s 30-day window for customers to object to fees or charges.
“Where do we draw the line?” Stegall said. “What if the contract just said, ‘You’re banned from bringing any claim against (Capitol Federal), period?’ Why is it that the courthouse doors are just slammed shut?”
In September 2022, Harding’s lawyers filed the lawsuit against Capitol Federal to challenge the fee assessed her for a purchase that was authorized when she still had a positive balance in her checking account. Harding said it was a violation of the customer agreement for the bank to charge her a $32 overdraft fee on that transaction, because it was settled when the account no longer had sufficient funds to cover the purchase.
Ramirez joined Harding’s suit in October 2022 after alleging Capitol Federal broke the account agreement by charging her a fee each time AT&T attempted to collect on a $164.87 bill. She asserted nothing in the customer agreement gave Capitol Federal authority to assess the $32 overdraft fee three separate times on a single debit card item.
Kersten Holzhueter, who represented Capitol Federal, told the Supreme Court that the district court’s dismissal of the class-action lawsuit was proper. The fees at the core of the suit were permitted by the customer contract, she said.
In response to Stegall, she said a complete prohibition on lawsuits by account holders against Capitol Federal wouldn’t likely be allowed in Kansas. She said the 30-day limit in terms of challenging fee assessments was reasonable.
“They key issue to discuss here today, and reinforce in Kansas, is that not all petitions present questions that warrant discovery or trial,” Holzhueter said. “Having a bank account comes with obligations on the bank, but it also has responsibility for the account holder. This includes an obligation to notify Capitol Federal of certain disputes.”
David Seeley, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said his clients’ objections to Capitol Federal’s business practices should be allowed to move forward in district court.
“Plaintiff needs to have the opportunity to pursue these claims and shouldn’t be required to terminate them at the outset,” he said.
Seeley said monthly statements issued by Capitol Federal to account holders didn’t take into consideration complex circumstances in which an account could have been overdrawn.
“You know that if you are an expert on banking or banking law, and understand that this is a problem that is nationwide,” Seeley said.
He echoed the Court of Appeals, which declared in its opinion that “contrary to the district court’s ruling otherwise, nothing in the plain language of the notice provision clearly and unambiguously proves that the disputed bank fees are a type of charge that a consumer must report to Capitol Federal under the account agreement.”
Seeley said the 30-day notice provision imposed by Capitol Federal shouldn’t apply to impermissible fees the company charged its customers. He said the time restraint was fundamentally unfair.
“The court needs to be mindful that you are locking the doors to the courthouse if you uphold a provision like this,” Seeley said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kansas-Supreme-Court-chamber.png,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

(Photo by Dana Edwards/CT Mirror)Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.
Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.
The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.
Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.
While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.
“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”
According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.
In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.
Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.
Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.
The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.
In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.
Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.
But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.










This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island. It's actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.


– Connecticut DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes


Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.
“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”
In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.
While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.
“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.
One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.
“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”
In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.
Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.
However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.
“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate
Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.
Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)
“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”
Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.
Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.
Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.
Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.
A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.
Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.
“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.
At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.
State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.
Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.
“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”
Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.
While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.
“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”
Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia officials slammed Dominion Energy’s proposed peaker gas plant slated to be built in Chesterfield at an air permit hearing Monday night, as community members and their representatives said the pollution in the air will be too great.
“I don’t understand how we impose upon a community that’s been put upon over 70 years with serious air pollution of a coal plant that is finally breathing freely,” said Glen Besa with the Friends of Chesterfield advocacy group. “Now to be put upon to endure the air pollution associated with this plant.”
Meanwhile, business advocates supported the project, saying they want to be certain the lights turn on when they flip the switch. The company said the plant is critical for meeting demand.
The proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center would be built on the site of a former coal-fired power plant that  closed its doors two years ago after burning for over 70 years. Two gas units are still operational on the property and produce about 450MW of energy. The proposed project would only run about 37% of the time during peak demand days, such as the hottest and coldest days of the year. It’ll power up in a matter of minutes to assist the regional power grid to ease strain.
 

 
 
Twenty state legislators have signed on to a letter asking the State Corporation Commission to reject Dominion’s application of necessity and for the Department of Environmental Quality to reject the air permit. The letter explains how the state has committed to the Virginia Clean Economy Act that mandates utilities to be using 100% renewable energy sources by 2050.
September 2025 Letter - Chesterfield Peaker Plant.docx
“I call on the DEQ to deny Dominion’s air permit, and also call on Dominion to change course and instead help us lead the way so Virginia can do a true, clean energy transition,” said state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, who is also running for lieutenant governor.
Hundreds of members of the Chesterfield community and surrounding areas came to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality hearing for the air permit on Monday night. Since the coal plant closed down, the air quality in the area has improved. The department said that the so-called peaker plant will be significantly less polluting than the previous coal plant. 
The area near the plant has a high population of Black and Hispanic community members, many people in the community being Spanish-speaking. Advocates who spoke at the meeting said the plant could add to worsening health outcomes in the area, and the greenhouse gases will contribute to climate change that threatens the state.
“We need to move to cleaner energy sources due to our severe climate crisis. The number of 100-year storms and 500-year storms in our country, in our region, have increased immensely. The gas put out by this plant would not help that at all,” said Jessica Schneider, a Chesterfield County supervisor.
People at the meeting in favor of the plant donned stickers stating their support for reliable energy. Some said there are not enough renewable energy projects to manage the energy load the state is facing in the coming years.
“The Commonwealth must ensure businesses have access to dependable power, particularly during periods of high demand,” said Keith Martin, the CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “The ability to generate power on demand at any time and in any condition, is essential to maintaining grid reliability. Without a constant, always available power supply, the grid is vulnerable.”
The department uses air monitors inside the smoke stacks of plants to ensure they are not going over their allocated amount of pollutants. There are also community monitors to read the ambient air quality. 
“Emission reduction systems designed to reduce nitrogen oxide, carbon oxide, and other emissions will be added to the new units. CERC will always utilize newer, more efficient turbines that minimize the CO2 emissions,” said Kevin Battle with the boilermakers union, who hopes to build part of this project.
Those opposing the plant said the monitors are too far away from the plant and not accurate enough to get a read on how much people in the surrounding areas are breathing in. With the coal plant recently shutting down and coal ash still being removed from the site, they said  more pollutants should not be added to the air.
“I know there are options that are there,” said Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond. “And so I would just ask that Dominion and all the parties involved would find a better place to locate this and a better way in which to meet our energy demands.”
The roughly $1.4 billion construction project would be able to generate up to 1000MW of energy — enough to power 250,000 homes — and is anticipated to come online in 2029 if approved. It will add an estimated $1.36 to the average customer’s bill for the entire life of the project, which would span decades. That comes as Dominion is arguing to the State Corporation Commission to raise the base rate an additional $10 over the next two years. Dominion said this project is important to ensure there is grid reliability moving forward as power use increases.
“Without this facility, predictions show significant reliability risk in the near term. Speaking as a professional engineer, I believe we have presented compelling evidence of those risks for our regulators and the SCC,” said Cedric Green, the senior vice president of energy generation at Dominion.
Mark Miller, a Chesterfield county supervisor, said the new fusion plant that is also slated for the area will take away the need for the peaker plant. The nuclear energy plant is a first of its kind in the state and is expected to put 400 MW of energy on the grid by the early 2030s, according to Commonwealth Fusion Systems. A Dominion spokesperson said fusion plants are an emerging industry and that it does not have to be one or the other in an “all of the above” energy profile.
Dominion will present its case for the project to the SCC on Tuesday, Sept. 23. A decision is expected several weeks later.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences formally began its national search for a new chancellor Monday by releasing a leadership profile and beginning to accept inquiries about the post, according to a news release. 
Leaders of the state’s only academic medical center are searching for a replacement for Dr. Cam Patterson, who announced in June he was stepping down after seven years for personal and medical reasons and returning to a faculty position. UA System President Jay Silveria named Dr. Lowry Barnes, professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, interim chancellor, a role he began July 11.  
A search advisory committee is assisting Silveria with identifying candidates for the position, according to the release. 
“It goes without saying how critical this position is for the UA System and the state, as we seek a leader who can build on the excellent foundation laid by our faculty, staff, students and senior leaders,” Silveria said in a statement. “We are looking for someone who can take UAMS to the next level in each of its core mission areas of education, patient care and research, and who can help build a high-quality health care system for Arkansans in every corner of the state.”
The leadership profile released Monday will be used to recruit potential candidates by WittKieffer, an executive search and leadership advisory firm that is assisting UAMS and the UA System in the search process, according to the release.  
The recruitment phase of the search process may take several months, according to Dr. William J. Steinbach, advisory committee chair, UAMS chair of pediatrics and associate dean of child health. 
Steinbach said the goal of the committee is to develop a competitive pool of candidates to assist Silveria, who is tasked with recommending a finalist to the Board of Trustees, which is responsible for approving chancellor appointments. 
“UAMS is at a critical inflection point where we have the unique opportunity to identify candidates who can help shape a new trajectory for both this institution and for health care across our entire state,” Steinbach said. “We will take the time necessary to cast a broad net across the country to find superb candidates for this position who can transform this medical university for the next decade.”
More information is available on a website dedicated to the search.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A second high-ranking official in the Oklahoma governor’s administration has announced he’s resigning from his post.
Josh Cockroft, who serves as Oklahoma’s secretary of state and as Gov. Kevin Stitt’s chief policy advisor, announced on social media that he is resigning effective Oct. 2. He was appointed in 2023 by Stitt to serve as secretary of state and chief policy advisor. 
Cockroft, who is also a former state lawmaker, said it’s been an “honor” to serve the state of Oklahoma. In a letter he addressed to the governor dated Aug. 18, Cockroft thanked Stitt for his trust. 
“As I reflect on our accomplishments I can’t help but be filled with immense pride in what we’ve achieved together,” he wrote in the letter. “The unwavering pursuit of your guiding principles has shaped every decision you’ve made, and I have been incredibly blessed to be part of this movement.”
Crockroft and the Governor’s Office did not return requests for comment, but in a post on X, Cockroft said he’s “excited to announce a new chapter soon.” 
Cockroft’s resignation comes as Stitt also searches for a replacement for Rick Rose, the head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and who also serves as Oklahoma’s chief operating officer.
Rose tendered his resignation, effective Sept. 26, on Monday just over a year after being appointed to the position. His resignation followed a dispute with Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. 
Drummond said he sent Stitt a letter questioning Rose’s decision not to approve requests to purchase vehicles for agents in his office and whether or not this was at Stitt’s direction. He said Rose denied the purchase because he wanted to know why Drummond’s employee count had grown. 
In a statement provided late Monday evening, Rose denied Drummond’s claim that he resigned because of the attorney general’s letter. 
He said he was planning to resign before any letter was sent to the governor. 
“Under state law the OMES Director holds the authority to approve or deny agency vehicle purchases,” Rose said. “It’s up to the agency to justify the need for that vehicle. This helps promote responsible spending of state dollars. OMES contacted a number of agencies and does not seek a personal battle with the AG. While other agencies complied with the request, the AG chose to write an accusatory letter to the governor.”

July 22, 2024. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Republican lawmakers are asking the federal government to revoke all remaining offshore wind leases in the Gulf of Maine. 
This week, Republican members of the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee, as well as several other state representatives and senators, wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. The Maine lawmakers praised the Trump administration’s actions to stop new offshore wind leasing, given their concerns about offshore wind projects posing a threat to the fishing industry and coastal communities. 
“Floating offshore wind remains too experimental, too costly, and too disruptive for the people of Maine to bear,” the letter, which was authored by Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport), concludes.
The lawmakers are asking the administration to go further by revoking the four leases in the Gulf of Maine that were auctioned in 2024 and terminating the lease for the Maine Research Array. It also asks to cancel the upcoming bottom trawl survey of the research array area, and for “a comprehensive review of offshore wind regulations to prioritize affordable, reliable, proven energy sources.”  
The letter comes weeks after the Trump administration abruptly cancelled Revolution Wind, a wind project off the shore of Rhode Island that is already 80% complete. That case is now playing out in a Boston federal court.

This isn’t the first time Maine Republican lawmakers have made such a request. 
On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order for a temporary halt in new or renewed offshore wind leases in all areas of the outer continental shelf. It also included a review of the federal government’s leasing and permitting process for existing wind projects. 
Shortly after, Paul drafted a letter on behalf of her caucus colleagues to Trump and Burgum thanking them for that initial executive order and asking them to end the existing leases, the same plea in the latest letter. In February 2024, the state announced its hope to build an offshore wind port in Paul’s district to support its larger goal to develop 3,000 megawatts of wind power in the Gulf of Maine by 2040.
The letter sent Tuesday states that Mainers are suffering under high electricity rates, claiming a 36.3% rate increase over the past year. Although ratepayers have seen an increase, state officials have pushed back on that specific number, saying that it doesn’t reflect the reality of residential energy bills. 
Though Republican lawmakers have repeatedly argued that the price hikes are the result of Gov. Janet Mills’ and Democratic lawmakers’ climate policies, electricity rates are made up of multiple cost components that are affected by global markets, state policy and private utility companies. 
Additionally, a new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. 
As Maine has set clean energy and climate goals, developing offshore wind as a power source has been at the crux of meeting those ambitions. The Governor’s Energy Office released a technical report last December showing that while it is possible to meet the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040, wind and solar are key components of meeting increased electrification demands from plug-in cars and heating options.

But the first-in-the-nation stockpile would still have thousands more pills not set to expire for a few more years.
Then-Gov. Jay Inslee authorized the purchase of the first 30,000 doses of mifepristone in 2023 as a three-year insurance policy in case the drug was no longer available due to restrictions at the federal level. In Washington, that hasn’t been an issue — at least yet. 
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, mifepristone and misoprostol, the two abortion-inducing drugs, have become key for people to continue accessing the procedure, as some Republican-led states have banned abortion. 
Some states have also looked to limit access to the drugs.
For Washington, the bigger threat is federal regulation. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly signaled a willingness to limit access to mifepristone. While testifying before Congress last week, he suggested rolling back access to abortion pills expanded under the Biden administration.
In July, a federal judge in eastern Washington sided with the federal government, ruling that providers must be certified specifically to prescribe mifepristone. The Biden administration imposed that rule in the wake of safety concerns about the medication. 
Washington and other states argued this would be a barrier to access, and noted research attesting to the drug’s safety. The July decision overturned the judge’s own previous ruling blocking the stricter federal requirements for prescribers. 
The decision disappointed state Attorney General Nick Brown, but he has emphasized that it had “no immediate impact on access to mifepristone here in Washington.”
“My office stands ready to fight any unlawful attempts to curtail mifepristone’s availability here,” he added.
The stockpile’s future
Though the state could soon destroy 30,000 pills, a mifepristone stockpile will remain.
Inslee OK’d the purchase of another 17,600 doses shortly before leaving office in January, costing $757,000. Washington’s initial 30,000 doses of mifepristone, sitting in a state Department of Corrections facility since 2023, cost $1.275 million, said agency spokesperson Christopher Wright.
The cost for incinerating the pills is expected to be less than $1,000.
The state can only provide mifepristone to qualified clinics and prescribers, and has to sell it for at least the price for which it was purchased, said Brionna Aho, spokesperson for Gov. Bob Ferguson. But providers can still get pills for less from wholesalers. 
“We continue to be open to options to utilize the stockpile before it expires, but at this point, there is not a demand for it,” Aho said.
The extra 17,600 doses expire in late 2028 and early 2029, Aho noted. On that purchase, the supplier agreed to accept unused doses when they expire and exchange them for new pills at no cost to the state. So destroying those pills will likely be unnecessary. 
A separate stockpile of misoprostol expiring in February and March 2026 may also need to be destroyed, Aho said. 
University of Washington Medicine had its own 10,000-pill stockpile of mifepristone. All of it has been distributed to clinics in the state, said spokesperson Susan Gregg.
Fight over the drug isn’t finished 
The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to mifepristone from abortion opponents due to a legal technicality, preserving access. 
Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are now asking a federal judge in Texas to make it much harder to get prescribed mifepristone, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2000.
“That’s the real threat that we are watching,” said Courtney Normand, the Washington director of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.
“If things go south in Texas,” Normand said, “then mifepristone access nationwide will be blocked.”
Meanwhile, the most significant recent blow to abortion access in Washington is an $8.5 million cut included in this year’s biennial state budget. Normand and other advocates are urging lawmakers to restore this funding for abortion services in next year’s legislative session.
In 2024, medication abortions accounted for about 68% of all abortions in Washington. Of more than 14,500 medication abortions that year in the state, providers reported complications in 135 cases, according to the state Department of Health. The most common complications were that the pill didn’t work. Fewer than 0.2% resulted in hospitalization.
More than 3,000 of those medication abortions were conducted via telemedicine, according to state data.
Last month, Brown and attorneys general in more than a dozen other states petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to remove restrictions on mifepristone access, including the prescriber certification requirement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mifepristone-tablets.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 12:58:28.823025

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Senate Democratic leaders are demanding that George Mason University’s Rector Charles Stimson step down, saying his position as a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation is a conflict of interest, as the university navigates federal investigations centered on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that federal leaders are working to eradicate on college campuses nationwide.
The U.S. Department of Education claimed last month that GMU’s hiring practices violated civil rights law. In response, the school’s governing board stated that it wishes to negotiate a resolution with the agency, despite its president Gregory Washington’s attorney pushing back against the proposal.
But in the past week, Senate Democratic leaders learned that conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation published a Sept. 2 report titled “Uncovering Radical Efforts to Disguise DEI,” while state Democrats said “targets” and “undermines” the university and Washington, and prompted them to call for Stimson to vacate his role as rector at GMU. The report also recommends the federal government withhold funding from institutions, including George Mason.
“As Rector, you have fiduciary duties to advocate for the university’s best interests, including securing necessary federal funding,” the Democratic leaders’ letter stated. “Yet your employer has publicly advocated for actions that would directly harm the institution you lead.”
The letter signed by Senate Democratic leadership — Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton — also called on Stimson to recuse himself from Washington’s employment status or performance evaluation, any university responses to federal DEI investigations or compliance matters, university funding strategies — particularly those involving federal sources and any matters related to the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or policies. 
“Virginia’s public universities deserve board leadership that is uncompromisingly committed to their success and welfare. The current situation places you in a position where your employer’s interests may conflict with your fiduciary duties to George Mason University, its students, faculty, and the commonwealth,” the lawmakers’ letter read.
The Mercury contacted GMU for comment from Stimson but has not heard back.
George Mason’s Board of Visitors has only six voting members primarily due to Democrats rejecting multiple appointments made by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in addition to other university boards. The appointees, Democrats said, have introduced additional “controversy” and “division,” and have “abdicated” their responsibilities.
Feds claim GMU’s hiring practices violated civil rights law; GMU president’s attorney pushes back

Democrats sent a second letter on the same day to university rectors at the Virginia Military Institute, University of Virginia and George Mason urging them to acknowledge that none of the appointments are to be recognized after being rejected by the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections. A circuit court judge temporarily blocked the appointees from serving on the boards as the matter plays out in court. 
Stimson is not the first member to be called on to step down from the GMU’s governing board. Last summer, Democrats called for the removal of Lindsey Burke, whom Youngkin appointed. She is one of the authors of Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House — produced by the Heritage Foundation. 
Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, called for her removal because her “extreme views are alarming and contradicts the commonwealth’s efforts.”
The governor said he had no intention of removing Burke, who was the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation. However, she left the board before the end of her term to accept the role as deputy chief of staff for Policy and Programs with the U.S. Department of Education.
The executive committee of American Association of University Professors for George Mason University wrote in a four page letter released Tuesday that it supports Democrats’ request for Stimson to step down.
Stimson joined the board on July 1, 2023 after being confirmed by the General Assembly. His term ends June 30, 2027.

Sign up here to get the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to you each morning.
Years before Mayor Eric Adams gave Waymo the green light to test its robot cars in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, the company spent millions trying to woo public officials in hopes of someday having its autonomous vehicles cleared to cruise New York City streets.
Lobbying records reveal that Waymo — a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company — has, since at least 2019, poured more than $3 million into lobbying city and state leaders, who would need to change a law that prohibits driverless cars.   
“We understand that as we operate in new areas, it’s on us to explain our approach,” Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, told THE CITY. “That’s why our engagement with lawmakers is important — it reflects our commitment to explaining how our technology works and sharing our proven experience.”
Before New Yorkers can even think of hopping aboard self-driving cars, robo-vehicles face several hurdles that extend well beyond the end of this month, when a Waymo testing permit Adams approved in August expires. Autonomous-vehicle technology has previously been tested in Albany and Buffalo.
State law mandates that vehicles must be operated by humans, and even if that were changed, the city would also need to develop rules regulating self-driving cars. Multiple legislative efforts to that effect in the state legislature and the City Council have gone nowhere in recent years. 
Driverless vehicles were legalized as part of the 2018 state budget, but in order to be operational on the road a licensed driver must be behind the wheel. Companies have to apply to the state Department of Motor Vehicles for approval to operate on city streets. (And if the companies set their sights on the boroughs, they would need a go-ahead from the city Department of Transportation.) 
A state bill introduced in Albany would undo the requirement for a human driver — provided the autonomous vehicle carries insurance and meets certain other conditions. The bill has not moved forward despite being around since 2021.
Assemblymember Brian Cunningham (D-Brooklyn), who sponsored the bill in the lower chamber, said shaking off the requirement to have a person in a self-driving car would “begin to unlock some of the restrictive red tape that has held back the industry” from fully operating in New York state.
The bill’s other sponsor, Sen. Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester), who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said he is optimistic it will make headway this session. Initially the legislature required a person to be inside the vehicles to better ensure the technology’s safety.
“The technology has evolved,” he said. 
Then there is opposition from the more than 175,000 Taxi and Limousine Commission-licensed operators of yellow taxis and for-hire vehicles such as Uber and Lyft.
“Unlike other cities, New York is a place where driving is a full-time profession,” said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. “You’re talking about full-time drivers — this is their only bread and butter.” 
Through an app, passengers can already reserve rides on more than 2,000 driverless cars in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, with Waymo saying its vehicles have racked up more than 100 million fully autonomous miles in those five cities. Expansion is planned for next year in Miami, Dallas, Denver and Washington, D.C.
While a full New York rollout is unlikely to happen in short order, Waymo has been trying to make political inroads on cracking the biggest city in the country. 
Records show that the company’s lobbying targets have included city Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, multiple City Council members, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Manhattan Borough President and comptroller-elect Mark Levine and former Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, who previously served as head of the TLC.
Adams and Rodriguez signed off in August on the city’s first-ever permit for testing autonomous vehicles. It cleared Waymo for all-hours testing of eight of its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles through the end of this month, but requires a “trained safety specialist” behind the wheel at all times.
The tech company would need to reapply to the permit program in order to extend or expand its testing, which New Yorkers have been chronicling online through sightings of the Jaguars equipped with the technology already in use elsewhere. 
“We know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century,” Adams said in August. “As we continue to implement responsible innovation, we will always prioritize street safety.”
Riding Out
The Aug. 22 approval of Waymo’s permit application by a mayor who is running for re-election and struggling to survive politically caught some elected officials off guard.
“It kind of felt like, with the mayor sort of on his way out, sort of pulling random stuff out of a junk drawer and saying, ‘Hey, we never did this,’” said Councilmember Justin Brannan (D-Brooklyn), who co-sponsored a 2021 bill that would have required the TLC to establish rules regulating the use of autonomous vehicles as taxis.
The proposal — which also would have regulated licensing, safety, vehicle standards, insurance and trip and fare reporting — went nowhere.
City Comptroller Brad Lander, who co-sponsored that bill while serving in the City Council, said the legislation was designed, in part, to avoid a repeat of what happened more than a decade ago, when Uber’s arrival in New York upended the city’s yellow taxi industry and sunk the value of the taxi medallion.
“It’s unfortunate that a law did not get passed in advance of Waymo’s pilot that would have provided a framework for the considerations that the city needs to make about the arrival of autonomous for-hire vehicles or taxis,” Lander told THE CITY. “Having gone through the Uber process, we have the ability to foresee this and work to set the public policy considerations and rules on the city’s terms, rather than a private company’s terms.”
Desai said the early days of self-driving vehicles in New York bear more than a passing resemblance to Uber’s arrival in the city.
“Waymo is using the same tech-finance playbook of trying to dominate politically so they can monopolize financially,” she said.
But the city’s densely packed streets would offer a new type of challenge for self-driving vehicles.
“Autonomous vehicles right now might work in more suburban cities,” Brannan said. “But here, you’ve got pedestrians, and cyclists, and delivery workers and emergency vehicles and people just running in the street. 
“The margin for error is less than razor thin.”
Waymo, which began as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, says it’s taking the steps necessary to safely offer fully autonomous vehicle service on streets where the competition for space can be tough.
“While New York City would certainly be the most densely populated city Waymo has tackled in the U.S., the Waymo Driver already confronts and capably navigates many challenges associated with density — including different types of road users, jaywalking pedestrians, traffic and emergency vehicles — in five major U.S. cities,” Teicher said. 
The fate of autonomous cars in New York City may fall to the next mayoral administration. Frontrunners Zohran Mamdani — a Queens Assemblymember and the Democratic nominee — and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, may come at self-driving cars from different angles.
Mamdani has previously aligned himself with taxi workers, participating in their 2021 hunger strike over crushing medallion debt. Mamdani’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Cuomo, as governor, pushed to bring autonomous vehicles to New York, announcing in 2017 that they would be tested in Manhattan (then-Mayor Bill de Blasio was not on board). Cuomo’s successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, took a 2017 test ride in Albany while she was lieutenant governor. Cuomo’s campaign declined to comment.
The outcome of the mayoral election sets the stage for advancing a technology that’s likely to further upend how many New Yorkers move.
“That’s the big question,” Desai said. “Just because Adams gives this a final hour, desperate, green light does not mean the next administration cannot stop it and wait to formulate a thoughtful policy on how to address such a massive economic change.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25234695368876-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 12:58:28.823025

(Candidate photo courtesy of Hutcherson campaign | School bus photo by Rebecca Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A former school board president for Omaha Public Schools announced her bid Tuesday for an open seat on the Nebraska State Board of Education.
Lou Ann Goding, who served on the OPS board between 2013 and 2020, including as president in 2015 and 2016, said her statewide service would mirror her local service. Goding said she championed student achievement, increased teacher pay, safeguarded tax dollars and prioritized school safety for OPS. Goding ran for the Legislature in 2022.
In a Tuesday campaign announcement, Goding said she is running “to bring proven leadership and a results-driven approach to improving education for all Nebraska students.”

Goding noted Nebraska had an 88% high school graduation rate in the 2023-24 school year, yet 42% of high school juniors statewide tested as proficient in math and 45% of high school juniors tested as proficient in reading. The State Board of Education has prioritized those foundational skills, particularly literacy, with a goal to improve third-grade literacy rates to 75% by 2030.
“I will fight to close this ‘graduation vs. proficiency gap’ — to ensure our students aren’t just graduating with a piece of paper, but with the math, reading and critical thinking skills they will need for life and careers beyond the classroom,” Goding said in a statement.
District 8 on the State Board of Education covers central Douglas County. Incumbent Deb Neary, board vice president, has announced that she will not seek a third four-year term.
Goding, a native of Loup City and an Omaha resident since 1986, said she has five priorities for her campaign — success, safety, skills, support and stewardship — with multiple goals:

Improve student achievement through rigorous academic standards that better prepare students for careers after graduation.
Prioritize school safety with appropriate security systems and personnel and increased access to school psychologists.
Increase student proficiency in math and reading, ensure students are ready for the next grade level and highlight career and technical education.
Ensure teachers have the resources and support needed to successfully educate students.
Safeguard tax dollars, increase transparency and protect parental rights in education.

With uncertainty over what will happen to the U.S. Department of Education and possibly diverting tax dollars to states, Goding told the Nebraska Examiner that her background in financial consulting could be beneficial on the State Board of Education.

While on the OPS board, Goding said the board implemented a tool to allow constituents to better review and analyze the district’s budget and see how money is spent. 
Her OPS tenure also coincided with the Legislature’s 2019 approval of transferring management of a retirement system specific to Omaha school employees to the state. The state oversees retirement for all other schools, state employees and more.
Goding testified in favor of the legislation from former State Sen. Mark Kolterman of Seward, who had been chair of the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee and led the legislation following reporting about mismanagement in the OPS account. Kolterman is among those endorsing Goding’s 2026 campaign.
“I think that sets me up to be able to effectively look at and help guide and direct the funding which will be most effectively supporting our students and teachers and ultimately the taxpayer,” Goding told the Examiner.
Other early endorsements for Goding include U.S. Sens. Pete Ricketts and Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; former Gov. Dave Heineman; Attorney General Mike Hilgers; Omaha State Sens. Kathleen Kauth and Christy Armendariz and current State Board of Education member Lisa Schonhoff.
Goding joins the officially nonpartisan race for the education board with Sherrye Hutcherson, an executive vice president of Bellevue University.
The State Board of Education is currently split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats. Neary is a registered Democrat and won a close reelection in 2022 against a conservative challenger. Goding is a registered Republican. Hutcherson is a registered nonpartisan. 
During Goding’s tenure on the OPS board, she said she also helped the district work on a strategic plan that set students and teachers up for success. The board’s work included a specialized program at a North Omaha elementary school that mirrored a program in Atlanta to replace one section of a student’s “special” courses — such as for music or art — with a small group session for students struggling with core skills.
Goding said she recalls a young boy struggling in math who asked his teacher what would happen if he passed his math test, which would allow him to go to art in addition to his music course. However, he purposefully failed the test because he enjoyed the extra support.
A successful four years in office, Goding said, would mean improved test scores through long-term and lasting strategies. She said this focus could mean keeping a student in a grade level for another year to give them extra support.
“When you implement with consistency and you allow your staff to do what’s best for the students in the building, then you actually see success,” Goding said.
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 election.

Bocicaut remembers seeing the utter devastation of the attacks, and helped distribute body bags. He also remembers seeing a fog, but he later found out it was something else.
“A lot of people who were there day in and day out for several days, might have been affected health-wise by the dust, all the carcinogens that were flying in the air,” Bocicaut said. “We didn’t know what they were.”
Thousands of people who participated in the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York ended up suffering from health complications as a result. After years of advocacy, they finally received federal funding to help with health care costs and other benefits.
The Trump administration’s attempts at scaling back programs associated with those benefits were quickly reversed after outcry from advocates and politicians from the tri-state area.
However, some still worry about the availability of future access to these programs.
Bocicaut did not participate in these programs and did not get sick. But he is an advocate for those who did. He said providing for those volunteers and rescue workers should not be up for debate.
“I think we should take care of them, the country has an obligation to take care of them,” Bocicaut said.
The World Trade Center Health Program was one of several programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) impacted by broader federal staffing cuts earlier this year.
The cuts were reversed after outcry from victims’ families and advocates. Connecticut State Rep. Bill Heffernan, a Democrat, said lawmakers are continuing to keep a watchful eye on the program.
Heffernan was also a firefighter at the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center, known at the time as The Pile. He was later diagnosed with cancer, but isn’t sure if his time spent at the site contributed to his diagnosis.
While the programs now enjoy broad political support, Heffernan remembers how much work went into getting those benefits in the first place.
Heffernan said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) supported the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. It was named after a New York City Police Department officer who is considered the first NYPD death confirmed to be linked to the recovery efforts.
The funding for the health care ended up getting extended in 2015 until the year 2090. But while the program is not at risk, any risk accessing that care needs to be closely watched, Heffernan said.
“I know that everyone threatens things now, this is going to be cut, that’s going to be cut, and we’re on the ball,” Heffernan said. “We’re keeping an eye on it. So I want to make sure that those benefits don’t go anywhere.”
Connecticut State Sen. Tony Hwang, a Republican who represents Fairfield, was among those who honored 9/11 victims at the state’s annual remembrance ceremony at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport Thursday. While speaking at the event, Hwang defended the benefits for 9/11 first responders.
“God bless all of those that have been adversely impacted by a senseless and terrible tragedy, and let us make sure that we protect and ensure their health and safety into the future year,” Hwang said. “It is our obligation as a society to ensure that we do that.”
Blumenthal’s son, State Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Democrat who represents Stamford, said access to the programs have never had a guaranteed future. And while the programs are safe, any impact to them should be defended against, underscoring how raw the attacks remain on the tri-state area.
“It’s vital that we continue to preserve them, to make sure that everyone who sacrificed that day is taken care of, and that their sacrifice was not in vain,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/911-first-responders-CTPublic-1024x683.webp,,,2025-09-09 11:58:41.804302

Among those committees will be the new House Select committee on Congressional Redistricting.
Rep. Mike Redondo, first elected in 2023 to represent part of Miami-Dade County, will chair the 11-person committee.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month that the committee would convene. The Senate lacks a similar panel.
Florida House creating a committee on congressional redistricting

“Exploring” questions related to redistricting, Perez said last month, “would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our Supreme Court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.”
A spokesperson for Senate President Ben Albritton told the Phoenix Tuesday that the Senate had no updates about whether the Senate would convene a committee on congressional redistricting.
The questions Perez referred to are the “applicability and interpretation of certain provisions of the so-called ‘Fair Districts’ provisions of the Florida Constitution and their intersection with Federal law.”
The Fair District provisions in the Florida Constitution won voter approval in 2010 and is intended to block the Legislature from designing districts to benefit any political party or incumbent. They’re also intended to protect minority representation.
As previously reported by the Phoenix, congressional redistricting was not in conversation during the previous legislative session; however, national conversations have brought it into the spotlight as President Donald Trump called for a mid-decade census.
Florida claims to have been “egregiously undercounted” during the last Census, and Texas has already redistricted.
“The decision to launch a mid-decade drawing of congressional maps is unnecessary and expensive. This is a backroom power grab from Republican politicians,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a written statement following the release of the the committee members.
“Voters didn’t ask for this. Instead of tackling the affordability crisis Floridians are facing every day, Republican leadership is trying to protect their congressional Republicans from the fall out of the Big Ugly Bill. Florida Democrats will continue to fight for fair representation and ensure Floridians’ voices are not silenced at the ballot box,” Fried continued.
Also on the committee are Republican Reps. Jessica Baker, Kim Berfield, Nan Cobb, Peggy Gossett-Seidman, Patt Maney, Jenna Persons-Mulicka, and Will Robinson. Reps. Bruce Antone, Kevin Chambliss, and Johanna López are the Democrats on the committee.
Perez announced the panel alongside other committee assignments for the session that will start in January, including some changing chairships.
Perez previously said that no representatives who have expressed interest in running for Congress would be placed on the committee.
He added that while representatives are free to express their opinions on the issue, “statements about redistricting that suggest an intent to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party, which is currently prohibited by the Florida Constitution, will also disqualify you from consideration.”

(USDA photo by Bob Nichols)South Dakota is at the epicenter of this fall’s bird flu season with a total of 134,900 turkeys at three facilities already killed to contain the spread, and reports coming in about thousands more. 
The only other state reporting confirmed infections in commercial flocks during the last 30 days is North Dakota, where 60,300 turkeys have been killed in response, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Detections this early in the season are troubling, according to Beth Thompson, South Dakota’s state veterinarian. The peak avian influenza seasons typically coincide with the fall and spring migration of wild birds, which can carry the virus without becoming sick. The spread of bird flu before those migrations begin is concerning.
“I have not seen any information so far that major wild bird migrations have started,” Thompson said. “That is not a good sign.”
The season’s first infection in South Dakota was confirmed Aug. 28 in Faulk County, where 55,400 turkeys had to be killed, followed by a Sept. 2 case in Beadle County where 52,600 birds were put down. The third was in McPherson County, causing 26,900 birds to be killed. 
Thompson said that puts South Dakota at the “leading edge” of this season’s infections, with further cases already being investigated.
The bird flu depopulation process is federally mandated and involves killing all birds at affected sites to prevent the virus from spreading to nearby farms. Thompson said “foaming” is the most common method in turkey barns, where foam is sprayed atop turkeys inside the barn to suffocate them. 
She said federal law requires producers to carry out the depopulation process with assistance from federal and state officials who oversee the work, with the federal government covering losses through indemnity payments. Those payments have totaled more than $1 billion nationally since 2020, according to analysis by CBS News, including about $130 million in South Dakota.
Thompson emphasized that poultry products remain safe to eat. 
“Chicken, turkey, eggs — all of those products go through a rigorous food safety protocol,” she said. “The public should be completely confident in their food supply.”
Thompson said backyard flock owners are urged to work with veterinarians and report any sudden bird deaths.

The project was founded in August last year, “out of the legacy” of the Wrongful Conviction Clinic at the Indiana University McKinney School of Law, according to the release.
It began operations with three pending cases and has since accepted two more, with four of the five clients serving life sentences for murder. The group has seven board members — including Hoosier exonerees Kristine Bunch and Roosevelt Glenn — and three staff members.
“We are thrilled to announce the INIP as the newest member of the Network,” said Meredith Kennedy, director of the Innocence Network’s Support Unit. “Since its founding in 2024, the INIP has rapidly mobilized to secure justice for Hoosiers who have been wrongfully imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. We look forward to working together to champion policies and legislative reforms aimed at preventing and rectifying wrongful convictions in Indiana.”
As a new member, the project will collaborate with other member organizations, get capacity-building assistance, and contribute to the network’s collective efforts and strategic direction. It’s the second group from Indiana to join, after the Notre Dame Exoneration Justice Clinic.
Since 2005, Innocence Network members have collectively exonerated more than 850 people, according to the release. They operate across the nation and in a dozen other countries.

That’s not a joke.""","Editor’s note: This Mississippi Today Ideas essay is published as part of our Brain Drain project, which seeks answers to why Mississippians move out of state. To read more about the project, click here.

Growing up in Jackson, I had it good. My walk to school, Jackson Academy, was less than half a mile and if I wasn’t asleep or out with my friends, I was at school. I did show choir, sports broadcasting, tutored kids and spent a great deal of time studying.
I didn’t understand it at the time, but what made my formative years so great was my autonomy. I could stay at the school working a broadcast or rehearsal until 10 p.m., walk home and go to bed without a second thought.
Moving away to study civil engineering, I realized that most of my peers didn’t grow up with the level of autonomy that I enjoyed, and that played a big role in the passion I have for civil engineering. So far, I’ve learned a lot more than I bargained for, but it opened the door to understanding the broader complex system of infrastructure that connects and builds our communities.
After the elections this year, it was clear to me that Jackson is ready to do whatever it takes, and doing infrastructure right is crucial to setting the city up for success.
I believe downtown Jackson is key to creating that success.
Downtown Jackson is the most financially successful region of the city. That’s not a joke. As a civil engineering student well into my degree at Mississippi State, I have seen the latest developments in urban design.
In the context of Jackson, one company, North Carolina-based Urban 3, has stood out. Urban 3 helps cities by creating a comprehensive analysis of a city’s expenses and revenues.

Lafayette, Louisiana, is my favorite city to compare to Jackson. It’s a Southern city with rich history and culture. It has a population, suburban makeup and types of developments similar to Jackson’s.
Urban 3’s study of Lafayette found that the urban core generated the most in property taxes, enough to effectively subsidize properties and projects outside of the urban core. The rest of the city brought in roughly net zero or lost the city money. 
While Jackson has not been evaluated by Urban 3, every other city and town that has been evaluated has seen the same outcome. The densest urban parts of a community routinely bring in far more in tax revenue than they cost in infrastructure maintenance, policing, libraries, etc.
Jackson already has the buildings in place, but many of these buildings have no tenants or only partial occupancy. That is unacceptable. Downtown is the economic engine behind every community, and Jackson needs to repopulate its downtown to stand a chance at helping the rest of the city flourish.
Fortunately, the tools already exist to accomplish that goal. They just have to be used.
The first step is the most cost effective. I suggest updating downtown’s zoning codes to form-based codes (FBCs). FBCs do away with deciding which lot will be residential, commercial, etc.
Instead, FBCs establish a uniform look for a specified area. For example, an FBC may require building setbacks, height maximums and 50% of the first floor be commercial, hence FBCs are often more forgiving than traditional zoning codes.
Additionally, FBCs give property owners the power of the free market to decide how to best use their property; whether it be a grocery store, a law office or a furniture shop. This does not mean that all regulations should be abandoned, but you shouldn’t have to go through the lengthy process of rezoning the whole property for every new use.
The second step is the toughest to implement. I suggest that the city take a hard look at which properties still warrant new infrastructure spending.The city has lost thousands of residents since its peak population, and some neighborhoods simply do not have the number of residents to justify new roads or utilities.
Jackson is currently overbuilt, and the city needs to put what money it does have into investments that have the best odds of stabilizing the city.
If Jackson does not take care of the areas that can and currently do bring in net positive tax revenue for the city, then there is no chance for the rest of the city. Only by obsessively maintaining the infrastructure, utilities and public services for downtown will the city set up its golden goose with the best odds for success.
The third step is the most costly, but proven. Downtown should be designed at a human scale. To do that, streets must be built around people and their safety first. In the context of civil engineering, many experts put our roadways into one of two buckets.
The first bucket is labeled “roads.” Roads should be used to get you from point A to point B as fast as possible. Therefore, it would be absurd to build a Walmart with direct access to I-55 because of the danger of entering and exiting, not to mention the slow down of traffic along the interstate.
In the other bucket there are “streets.” Streets should be used to connect a storefront to its customers, building community wealth. Like the Walmart on I-55, it would be an equally bad idea to let drivers fly down the street with no way to slow them down.
Unfortunately, many of our roadways look like something in between the street and the road I just described, neither moving people efficiently nor building community wealth.
If you sit down for just a few minutes along West, State or Pascagoula streets, you will see cars flying down the road in what is supposed to be a downtown. Downtown can not be a safe and comfortable space for people of all ages when cars essentially have a drag strip to go as fast as they please.
Fortunately, the city has shown that it knows how to reorient these overgrown streets as proven on East Capitol Street. One lane was removed, roundabouts were built and sidewalks given more separation from traffic.
To prove my point, walk down Capitol Street and then walk down any of the three aforementioned streets. The difference is night and day.
Regardless of everything that can and will be done, some businesses and residents will still choose to leave. That is OK, because others will see the success of downtown and choose to move in, not because it will happen, but because it is already happening. Remo’s, Aladdin and Mayflower are all great new additions.

Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons on Tuesday concluded there wasn’t sufficient evidence to prove that the 15 individuals, charged with a host of forgery and conspiracy crimes, had criminal intent when they allegedly signed documents certifying Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump.
Simmons dismissed the charges and did not order the cadre to be bound over for trial.
The defendants included Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock, Hank Choate, Amy Facchinello, Clifford Frost, Stanley Grot, John Haggard, Mary-Ann Henry, Timothy King, Michele Lundgren, Mayra Rodriguez, Rose Rook, Marian Sheridan, Kenneth Thompson and Kent Vanderwood.

The ruling from Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons on Tuesday received praise from supporters of the 15 defendants, who rallied outside the courthouse in downtown Lansing on Tuesday, and troubled Attorney General Dana Nessel, who warned of a slippery slope for American democracy now that the charges were dismissed.
Simmons, in a decision from the bench, concluded there wasn’t sufficient evidence to prove that the 15 individuals, charged with a host of forgery and conspiracy crimes, had criminal intent when they allegedly signed documents certifying Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump.

While the attorney general’s office retains the right to appeal Simmons’ decision, Nessel said her office is reviewing the matter and that they would be making that decision at a later time.
The defendants included Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock, Hank Choate, Amy Facchinello, Clifford Frost, Stanley Grot, John Haggard, Mary-Ann Henry, Timothy King, Michele Lundgren, Mayra Rodriguez, Rose Rook, Marian Sheridan, Kenneth Thompson and Kent Vanderwood.
While a 16th individual, James Renner, initially faced eight felony charges, Renner reached a cooperation agreement with the attorney general’s office, which led to the charges being dropped. He later served as a key witness for state prosecutors.
Simmons recounted Renner’s testimony, when he told the court the group did not intend to commit fraud or forgery during the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting in the basement of the Michigan Republican Party headquarters where they signed the documents.

“Renner testified that they were told that this was an appropriate process, by the leaders and attorneys that were present at the meeting,” Simmons told the courtroom, noting additional testimony where Renner said he would not have attended the meeting if he believed a crime was being committed.
While the attorney general’s office called several witnesses, Simmons said their testimony largely aligned with Renner’s later on, noting that reliance on advice from attorneys tends to refute the government’s ability to prove intent. 
Following Simmons’ decision, John Freeman, who represented Sheridan, told reporters that Simmons’ decision was in line with what the defense had been arguing since the beginning of the case. 
Sheridan said she was overwhelmingly happy with the judge’s decision, but that she was frustrated the charges had gone this far. 
“This should have never happened. This was clearly malicious prosecution,” Sheridan said.
Choate offered similar sentiments, telling reporters that as a dairy farmer, he never expected to be sitting in a courtroom facing criminal charges. 
“We stood solid, demonstrated courage,” Choate said. “We felt and knew in our hearts that we were right in what we wanted to do, and no way were we going to bow down to political persecution or political intimidation.”
Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad also cheered Simmons’ decision while accusing Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel – a Democrat who has been a fierce opponent of President Donald Trump, leading or joining more than 30 cases against his administration – of weaponizing her office against her political opponents.
“Today, Judge Kristen Simmons restored the public’s faith in our justice system. All 2020 Trump Electors have officially been vindicated,” Runestad said in a statement.

Nessel warns of ruling’s potential damage to American democracy
Nessel spoke with reporters in a virtual news conference following the ruling. Although Simmons emphasized the complexity of the case, as demonstrated by the lengthy preliminary examination and the amount of evidence reviewed, Nessel argued the case is quite simple.
“The evidence was clear. They lied,” Nessel asked. “They knew they lied, and they tried to steal the votes of millions of Michiganders. And if they can get away with this, well, what can’t they get away with next?”
She shared further concerns about the bearing this case would have on upcoming elections and American Democracy as a whole. Nessel also raised concerns about fear of retaliation and intimidation of judges handling cases concerning the president. 
“This is the most dangerous slippery slope that exists for American democracy: When the courts determine that violations of election law should not even be heard by a jury; when state legislators and governors across America make it easier for Trump to cheat; when the Supreme Court hands the president a blank check to violate any law, commit any crime without penalty or consequence,” Nessel said.
As the state moves into another election year, Nessel said she is worried that the damage to the American election system has already been done.
“I am terrified for the 2026 elections, and not because I’m worried somebody I support will lose,” Nessel said. “I’m worried that President Trump and his aiders and abettors and followers have already ensured that no future American election will ever really be fair or free.”

Running out of time to complete a learning unit on math fractions, Concord Elementary third grade teacher Brianne Sinden turned to her “team” of fellow second and third grade teachers.
Second grade teacher Becca Bradley offered to help out with an intervention time that divided the lesson in half, allowing Bradley’s second graders to participate in the lesson and benefit, as well.
“For 22 years, I’ve always felt like I’ve been stuck in this room, and it’s all on me,” Sinden said. “I mean, I can do a lot of things, but I can’t do it all well. So, I feel like teaming with second grade, it’s just opened up so many opportunities, and their ideas have been great.”
The small rural school district of 617 students in Jackson County is one of two schools in Michigan starting its second year of a “team teaching” pilot that moves away from a traditional “one teacher, one room” model and assigns a group of teachers, aides and other staff to an entire set of students, sometimes combining multiple grades.
While the team teaching model is intended to look different depending on the needs of the school, students typically learn from multiple teachers a day, sometimes with multiple teachers or educators in the room at the same time.
At Concord, time is set aside for daily breakout math and reading group instruction in the lower grade levels. During these lessons, younger students are blended with different grades, while older students in grades 8 to 10 participate in cross-curricular learning units teaching teams have devised. For instance, eighth grade students combined their studies on science-based environmental policy with math to demonstrate the pros and cons of the policy.

About 100 miles to the east in downtown Detroit, team teaching has helped the staff of the Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences focus on their strengths, assigning each of its teachers in kindergarten and second grade to a specific group of students for their phonics work.
Early returns on team teaching are positive at the K-8 charter school, with data showing improved scores in math for second graders who were a part of the pilot this past fall, Chief Academic Officer Monica McLeod said.
Like several of the schools nationwide that have adopted the team teaching model during its recent reemergence, McLeod cited two concurrent objectives: To attract and retain talented teachers and to make the profession more sustainable and connected by giving teachers more ownership over student learning.
“It pushed all of us to lean into our strengths and our trust and belief in each other,” McLeod said.
 Created a shared responsibility

The team teaching model was introduced in Michigan last fall through the Michigan Educator Workforce Initiative, a nonprofit that designs, funds and supports programs to recruit, develop and retain teachers. The initiative partnered with Arizona State University’s Next Education Workforce, which trains teachers on strategic staffing models and helps schools develop staffing models that work for their students.
With Michigan teachers leaving the profession at higher rates, MEWI CEO Jack Elsey said team teaching is one of several initiatives his organization has taken on in recent years in its comprehensive view of the educator pipeline.
With three more Michigan school districts debuting the staffing models this fall and 12 schools implementing strategic staffing statewide, Elsey said there is cautious optimism that team teaching could present benefits for both teacher retention and student achievement.
“I think overall, teachers feel better supported by their colleagues because they’re in the same physical space with them,” he said. “They can talk about those kids among people who know those kids just as well as they do and they can say, ‘You know, I’m really struggling with delivering this math lesson, can you deliver this math lesson to my kids today?’ because I think you do it in a better way.”
For Concord, participating in the pilot made sense with more than half of the district’s teachers becoming eligible for retirement in the next few years, Superintendent Rebecca Hutchinson said.
Teachers have reported that the pilot has helped them get to know their students on a deeper level and dive deeper into the core curriculum, Hutchinson said. It’s also helped teachers lean into their strengths, while allowing them more planning time and collaboration with members of their teams, Hutchinson said.
“It creates this distributed expertise, but also this shared responsibility,” said Hutchinson, who is in her 18th year with the district, including the past six as superintendent. “It’s not just about who’s in front of me and what’s in front of me right now.”
 Elevating the teaching profession

Foundationally, ASU has a “no one model” philosophy behind Next Education Workforce’s role in helping redesign teaching models, allowing for a distribution of expertise with the intention of deeper, personalized learning for students.
In Mesa Public Schools, the largest public district in Arizona, Next Education Workforce Executive Director Brent Maddin says there is evidence that teachers working in teams are more likely to remain in their district than their colleagues in traditional classroom models.
Mesa also has seen correlational data show teachers in team models are more effective than their colleagues in traditional classrooms and are happier and more engaged in their work, Maddin said.
“Our work, in particular, is largely focused on the educators and creating the conditions for them to thrive and to do their work differently,” Maddin said. “We’re not coming in with a particular ‘one size fits all’ approach. Instead, whatever the staffing model ultimately becomes is co-constructed by the educators in the communities in which the model is being implemented.”
Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences decided to start slowly, with just kindergarten and second grade teachers agreeing to participate in its first year.
Teachers were instrumental in both designing and tweaking the model early in the year, switching morning small group meetings focused on social-emotional learning to daily themes like “Motivational Monday” and “Talk about it Tuesday.” While students saw each of the grade’s five teachers every day for different subjects, they were assigned to a home room teacher and a classroom that was designated with the name of a fruit.
Toward the end of the year, second grade teachers gave team teaching the ultimate endorsement in a Power Point presentation to administrators and third grade teachers explaining why the model should follow their students into the next grade. The school kicked off the academic year expanding the pilot to third and sixth grades this fall.
“It was amazing,” second grade teacher Lindsay Solomon said. “I could stand up there and teach, and my co-teacher could go around and support scholars. Even if there was a behavior issue, she could quietly put that fire out without me ever having to stop teaching.”
Second grade teacher Tayla Watson described the relationship she had with team co-teacher Broyles as complementary, with each other’s strengths helping in areas where the other might struggle. With five grade-level teachers sharing a roster of 115 students, it also allowed the teaching staff to more easily cover for each other when there were absences, Watson said, resulting in fewer interruptions to student learning.
“I think we have a lot more trust from our administrators and our leaders, because we are united and working together,” Watson said. “I think that that is something that could really elevate the teaching profession.”
 No one model

At Concord, team teaching looks different in every grade. Children in second and third grades are combined and assigned a homeroom teacher who acts in a role similar to their classroom teacher. In fourth and fifth grades, students also are combined, but there are two teachers in the room at the same time. In higher grade levels, teachers come in for 30 minute subject “rotations” for each of the four core classes.
As an eighth grade teacher last year, Kayla Taylor could co-teach the humanities, with Taylor leading the way and another teacher providing additional oversight and support.
A student teacher was added in the second semester, bringing a third educator to the mix that allowed for more small group learning. This year, Taylor will teach ninth and 10th grades, with different weekly planning days on the schedule for both grades. Despite more planning between teachers to make it happen, Taylor said the model was effective in making a better use of students’ time.

“Even though the schedule was more traditional, we were able to do more in terms of stations or kind of differentiating the instruction depending on individual student needs,” Taylor said. “That wasn’t necessarily just the students with IEPs or 504 (plans) but also the advanced students and the students in the center, to ensure that everyone was continuing to make progress.”
Hutchinson said there have been early signs of success, with both eighth and ninth grades reducing the number of students failing or needing to recover credits.
With the district expanding team teaching to 10th grade this year, Hutchinson said each grade level continues to map out its own plan for its newest set of students, with shared goals around cross-curricular collaboration, “deeper” learning and building communication and reasoning.
“When you feel like you have a high sense of collective efficacy around the success of kids, it’s rewarding when you can sit down and make a plan and put that plan into action and that kid will succeed,” she said. “That’s the ultimate gift.”

McCuskey of West Virginia, and Liz Murrill of Louisiana participate in a panel discussion on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2025, at the Alaska Oil and Gas Association conference in Anchorage. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)During a pair of public panel discussions during the last week of August, attorneys general from five conservative Republican states said they see climate ‘superfund laws’ passed by Democratic states as major threats to the fossil fuel industries of their state.
“I think that the group of people that are on this panel are all united in making sure that all of the expertise in all of our offices are being utilized to make sure that this doesn’t keep going, because it’s very, very dangerous,” said J.B. McCuskey, attorney general of West Virginia, at the annual meeting of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.
Alongside him were attorneys general Kris Kobach of Kansas, Liz Murrill of Louisiana, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, and then-attorney general of Alaska, Treg Taylor.
The attorneys general said they are also concerned by lawsuits from states and local governments that could result in financial penalties against fossil fuel companies for disasters attributed to climate change.
Vermont made history in 2024 when it enacted a law that allows the state to hold fossil fuel companies financially liable for the negative impacts of climate change on that state. New York followed suit with a similar law later in the year. 
Under both laws, fines levied by the states and paid by fossil fuel companies would go into a large fund that would be spent on projects that could mitigate natural disasters or subsidize clean energy projects.
Other Democratic-led states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey and California, are considering similar laws.
“Now that we have a friendly EPA and a friendly administration, the blue states are deciding that they’re now going to be the EPA,” McCuskey said, speaking at a different panel hosted by the Republican Women of Anchorage. 
The attorneys general, plus Ken Paxton of Texas, who was not present at the industry panel, nodded along as McCuskey spoke.
“Their argument is that every single permitted operation that happened in Alaska caused $75 billion worth of damage to the people of New York. It’s completely outrageous. And the problem isn’t just that it’s New York, it’s that Illinois has one. California is going to have one. Vermont’s going to have one. Massachusetts is going to have one. You name a place that has radical environmentalists running their government, and then it becomes an amount of money that’s not withstandable,” McCuskey said.
Taylor, who has since resigned as Alaska’s attorney general and is expected to run for governor, said he believes that in states with budget holes, “it’s pretty convenient just to raise taxes on oil and gas, right? And those states that don’t have oil and gas, that’s their way of dealing with their budget shortfalls, is to take it out of oil and gas through these types of acts.”

Fossil fuel businesses and trade groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed suit last year against the Vermont law. 
A group of Republican attorneys general, led by McCuskey, sued New York in February. Another McCuskey-led suit, filed in May, targets Vermont. 
The Trump administration has also gotten involved by filing lawsuits against both states and against states like Hawaii that have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.
Those suits say companies should be financially liable for harm caused by climate change.
Speaking at the Alaska oil panel, Kobach said he’s concerned about climate lawsuits filed by cities and counties and believes they’re being encouraged by national environmental law firms and groups.
“The reason I’m so energized about fighting back against that is Ford County, Kansas, which you probably never heard of, where Dodge City is — little tiny county, rural county, very low population — somehow, they were convinced by some very well-heeled attorneys in California to be a plaintiff in one of these lawsuits. And so we’re chasing them around. My office is chasing them around, trying to get them kicked out of court because they don’t speak for the people of Kansas,” he said.
Taylor said he sees the same issue.
“We’re seeing those opportunistic plaintiffs’ attorneys convince municipalities and boroughs and cities to take on litigation that’s really not in their best interest and really puts money into their own pockets,” he said during the panel discussion.
McCuskey, of West Virginia, said his state is considering a law that would restrict the ability of local governments to sue.
Nationally, the fossil fuel industry is lobbying Congress to pass a liability shield law akin to the one passed in 2005 to protect the gun industry against lawsuits attempting to hold gun manufacturers responsible for gun crimes. 
In June, McCuskey and other attorneys general wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney General to offer support for a national liability shield to protect fossil fuel companies. 
The National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities have each adopted resolutions opposing such a liability shield. Both organizations say that local governments should retain the power to file lawsuits.
McCuskey, speaking at the oil panel, got a laugh from the audience when he asked attendees what they thought West Virginians would say if New York tried to collect a fine from the state of West Virginia.
“Our big joke is that the people in New York are literally looking down on us from the skyscrapers that were built with coal from West Virginia,” McCuskey said at the oil and gas association panel. “So they’re not just looking down on us figuratively, but both literally and figuratively, and they just have no contemplation of why their economies were built by the people who do the work that’s happening here.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250828-attorneys-general-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 10:58:45.878488

Gov. Tim Walz issued an executive order Monday directing the Minnesota Department of Health and the Department of Commerce to figure out how to make sure Minnesotans can continue receiving vaccines amid quickly changing federal recommendations that have led to the resignations of prominent government scientists, including Demetre C. Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. In a fiery resignation letter, Daskalakis wrote that “The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people.”
Minnesota joins Colorado, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York and Pennsylvania, which have issued similar orders after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it would be limiting the COVID-19 vaccine to people over 65 or with an underlying health condition.
The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington have formed a health alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations independent of federal decisions, and states in the northeast are considering following suit.
The Massachusetts commissioners of insurance and public health announced last week that Massachusetts health insurers must cover vaccines recommended by the state regardless of federal policy.
Walz’s order is slightly less aggressive, setting deadlines for the health and commerce departments to take care of legalities and logistics. Minnesotans can expect a standing order from the health department’s medical director on COVID-19 vaccine access within the next two weeks. By Oct. 6, the departments will need to convene health insurers and providers to come up with a plan to address barriers to vaccine access.
According to a press release announcing the order, pharmacists in Minnesota can administer COVID-19 vaccines regardless of recommendations from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was overhauled and whose members were replaced largely with vaccine skeptics by Kennedy in June.
But it’s unclear whether insurers will continue to cover the costs of vaccines not recommended by ACIP, especially since Minnesota law defines which immunizations insurers must provide under preventive care based on the advisory committee’s recommendations. Already, some Minnesotans have had trouble getting the latest COVID-19 vaccine to be covered by their insurance, the Star Tribune reported.
The order also directs MDH to monitor whether similar measures will need to be taken for other vaccines.
On Sept. 18 and 19, in addition to the COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP will discuss and possibly vote on recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine; measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine; and respiratory syncytial virus vaccine.

But one school has found a way around that. Instead of applying through fast-track replication, Triangle Math and Science Academy (TMSA) sought approval to open a “sub campus,” a designation some charter networks use to add new locations under an existing charter.
The North Carolina Charter School Review Board voted in a split 6-5 decision on Monday to approve the Durham County campus, about 11 miles from TMSA’s Apex location. The new school will replicate the school’s Apex K–8 model, eventually serving about 900 students, starting with grades K–5 in August 2026.
The debate wasn’t over whether TMSA could expand. The academy has strong academic record. Its Apex and Triangle campuses hold “A” state performance grades, while the Greensboro and Charlotte schools have shown improvement. The network now serves about 6,000 students across North Carolina, with more than 5,000 on waiting lists.
But TMSA’s decision to bypass the “fast-track replication” sparked an intense debate Monday over the “sub campus” model, which some members of the state review board worried it exposed a loophole in the system, particularly if low-performing schools tried the same approach.
“I’m not sure I really like this idea of I open a sub campus in a different district, and just call it a way of expanding that requires a quick 10 slides and an executive summary and 20 minutes of deliberation,” board member Eric Sanchez said.
John Eldridge, vice chair of the charter review board, echoed similar concerns.
“I just want to make sure we’re clear on what ‘sub campus’ means, because it could be seen as avoiding the process of having to go through the application process for a new school,” said Eldridge. “If that’s the case, and that’s how things move forward, then we have to be careful about what standards are in place for what sub campus means, so that we don’t open up a can of worms.”
But some board members praised the subcampus option and see it as a creative and  practical path for high performing charter schools weighed down by what they see as North Carolina’s lengthy application process, which can take months to complete.
“I am extremely in favor of this kind of category, especially with schools that … have an excellent track record,”board member Lindalyn Kakadelis said. “The application process can run [hundreds] of pages. If we want the charter school movement to expand in North Carolina, we need options like a sub campus.
Ashley Baquero, executive director of the state Office of Charter Schools, said concerns about low-performing schools using the “sub campus” model as a loophole are unlikely to materialize because such expansions still require approval from the Charter School Review Board.
“It’s unlikely the board would approve a sub campus for a low-performing school, just as in the past they have denied expansion requests for low-performing schools,” Baquero said.
But she noted that a different provision of state law could allow low-performing schools to move within a 10-mile radius without any oversight. “Because the law now allows a school to move up to 10 miles with no approval from the board or our office, hypothetically you could have a low-performing school move and have no control over that,” she said.
The board indicated it will form a subcommittee to establish clearer criteria for future sub campus requests.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_CharterSchool.jpg,,,2025-09-09 09:56:16.994865

Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to “continue fighting” after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted restrictions on immigration raids in Los Angeles, but the state might not have many options. 
California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged as much during a press conference Monday where he said he was disappointed in the decision but added that he respects the rule of law. 

Bonta: “The rationale articulated by Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh is dangerous and wrong. But he’s a Supreme Court justice and I’m not.”

As CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos explain, the country’s highest court handed President Donald Trump’s administration a win by lifting a restraining order that limited agents from conducting “roving patrols” and stopping people in part based on their appearance.
In addition to L.A., the ruling will likely have major impacts across the country, as immigration agents ramp up operations in Chicago, Boston and elsewhere.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, on social media: “This is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous — it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the U.S.”

While noting that California is not a party in the lawsuit, Bonta remained non-committal about the state’s options following the ruling, saying that it will monitor the dispute and potentially file an amicus brief should the involved parties respond to the court’s decision.
Meanwhile Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas hinted at possible legislative actions to push back against Trump “with everything we’ve got.” 

Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, in a statement: “We’ve already passed laws to prevent raids in our schools and hospitals. … The only way we stop Trump is by standing together.”

A federal judge issued the restraining order in July, siding with civil rights, immigrant rights and local government agencies that argued that immigration agents were violating Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
But in a 6-3 decision the Supreme Court granted the administration’s emergency request to lift that order, with the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissenting. 

Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion explaining his reasoning to lift restrictions: “Ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”


Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

CA officials honor ‘progressive warrior’ John Burton

The California Senate took a moment to honor one of its legends when it returned to business, recognizing John Burton, who died Sunday at the age of 92. 
Describing him as one of the Senate’s “finest members,” Senate president pro tem Mike Mcguire of Santa Rosa led the chamber on Monday in a moment of silence to honor the former lawmaker and California Democratic Party leader. 
Known for his brash way of speaking, Burton was a key figure in Democratic politics in California for decades. News of his passing drew multiple honors and tributes from California’s top officials, including from those whose careers were shaped by Burton, such as Gov. Newsom and Rep. Nancy Pelosi.

Newsom, in a statement: “There was no greater champion for the poor, the bullied, the disabled, and forgotten Californians than John Burton. … His legacy is not only written in the policies he helped enact, but in the countless lives he touched and uplifted, including my own.”

Newsom directed flags to be flown at half-staff, and the governor plans to posthumously induct Burton into the California Hall of Fame. In her tribute, Pelosi described Burton as a “towering progressive warrior,” while close friend and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that Burton’s influence was “immeasurable.”



School unions a maybe on sex abuse bill

California lawmakers are considering a bill that would help protect schoolchildren from being sexually abused by educators, but the measure faces opposition by some teacher’s unions, writes Matt Drange for CalMatters.
In addition to requiring training for teachers and students on how to recognize signs of sexual grooming, Senate Bill 848 would mandate district officials to report and track “egregious” instances of employee misconduct. It would also create a hiring database that administrators must use to vet prospective teachers for potential misconduct.
The database is intended to curb the practice of schools re-hiring teachers who have resigned from another school after being accused of sexual misconduct. The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, notably does not oppose the bill, despite opposing similar legislation in past years. The California Federation of Teachers and the California School Employees Association do, however, citing concerns over due process.

Tristan Brown, California Federation of Teachers’ legislative director. “We need to ensure a policy that captures individuals that are unfit to work in education while making sure innocent and unfairly charged employees have fair access to justice.”

Mom of California overdose victim pledges to keep fighting in Capitol,Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/09/mental-health-insurance-bill-dies/,"After a CalMatters investigation, lawmakers asked Christine Matlock Dougherty to testify on behalf of bills to regulate mental health insurance. They didn't pass this year.","In summary
After a CalMatters investigation, lawmakers asked Christine Matlock Dougherty to testify on behalf of bills to regulate mental health insurance. They didn’t pass this year.


Christine Matlock Dougherty received the text just after noon on the last Friday in August.
The mental health legislation she’d been advocating for in memory of her son was dead, held indefinitely by the state Senate Appropriations Committee in an annual culling of bills. 
Just like that. 
Poof.
In the text, Sherry Daley, a lobbyist with the California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Professionals, which sponsored the bill, explained simply:
“The bill was held. It won’t be moving forward this year. Sorry.”
More than four years have passed since Dougherty lost her 23-year-old son, Ryan Matlock, to a fentanyl overdose after his insurance refused to cover his stay in residential treatment. 
The office of Matt Haney, a Democratic state assemblymember from San Francisco, had reached out to her after CalMatters described her son’s passing in a special report on mental health insurance denials. The lawmaker asked her to testify on behalf of the bill to help prevent similar tragedies. 
She initially hesitated.
Talking about what happened to Ryan was already so painful. And to a room full of strangers in suits? With a video recording going?
But Haney’s office explained that Assembly Bill 669 would prevent health plans from reviewing a patient’s eligibility to stay in substance use treatment for the first 28 days after an in-network provider first approved the treatment. Ryan’s health plan had declined to cover his stay at the treatment facility after just three days.
Dougherty knew what her son would want her to do.
In recent months, Dougherty made three trips up to the state Capitol to testify on behalf of Haney’s proposal and another insurance-related bill that would require health plans to report data about how often they deny treatment. 
On those visits, she breathed deep, dabbed her eyes, told her story. 
If talking about what happened to Ryan could change the law, it seemed worth it.
But what if the law didn’t change?
Insurers lobbied against it. The California Association of Health Plans, which opposed the bill, said via email that it could have led to patients remaining in treatment longer than necessary, and could have created openings for bad actors in a residential treatment industry they said was already beset with “widespread waste, fraud and abuse”.
Haney’s bill wasn’t the only one held by the Senate Appropriations Committee that Friday. The committee is the last check before a bill can go to a final Senate vote. It sometimes holds bills without explanation. 
Of 425 bills that came before the committee, 309 were sent along to the Senate floor. 
A representative of state Sen. Anna Caballero, the committee’s chairperson, did not immediately respond to an email and phone call requesting comment Monday. But the bill’s supporters have their own theories about the reasons for its demise. 
Among them:
The state is in an extremely tough financial year, with revenue streams down and federal funding at risk. The Department of Managed Health Care’s estimate that the bill would cost more than $2 million a year  — an amount Haney calls “less than budget dust” — certainly didn’t help its chances.
The health insurance lobby opposed the bill and the state agency that regulates most health plans didn’t offer its help.  A spokesperson for the Department of Managed Health Care said it didn’t take a position on the bill.

Or, perhaps, the bill’s proponents say, they just ran out of time.
Haney called the bill’s loss “devastating.” He dismissed cost as a nonsensical “completely backward” reason for killing the bill. 
“When we don’t invest in treatment and we don’t get people off of drugs, there are astronomical costs to our state at every single level,” he said. “And so this is about investing in prevention, but it’s also simply holding private insurers accountable to Californians who should get the care they’re paying for.”
He pointed to what he described as a pattern of bills being killed in the Legislature, ones that hold private health insurers to account.
“That’s a pattern that Californians should be deeply angry about,” he said.
Families like Ryan’s “have the courage to share their story and it’s painful and it’s traumatizing and they put hope that we will hear them,” he said. “And in this case the Legislature did not and so we have to move forward and we have to try again.”

Dougherty, for her part, had originally assumed the entire Legislature would have the chance to weigh in on the proposal before it was discarded, not just a small cadre of senators. 
She felt frustrated. But also proud.
She had done her best to help make the experiences of families like her own a little more human for policymakers, a little less lost in talk of statistics and probabilities.

Pedro Zacarias
Pedro Zacarias is a farmworker and an advocate in the Purepecha community.


Extreme heat is a public health emergency for millions of Californians. For my family, it isn’t just a threat outdoors; it’s within our home as well. 
I live in a mobile home in Thermal in eastern Coachella Valley. Here, triple-digit heat creeps into our forecast earlier and earlier each year. This year, 100-degree days started in April and likely won’t end until October. 
Many times this summer, we tried using swamp coolers. But when humidity penetrates our homes, it’s a suffocating feeling, especially when you lack insulation. You can’t escape it. 
I know it’s dangerous to work seven or eight hours a day under the sun and then continue to bear oppressive temperatures at home, but what choice do I have?
State leaders can do something about this and pass Senate Bill 655 for my family and the millions of Californians this bill would help protect. The measure establishes a state policy that would require residential units to maintain a safe maximum indoor temperature. If it becomes law, it would affect future state regulations, programs and grant decisions.
California already has laws in place for homes to maintain a minimum indoor temperature. Why not have a law to ensure a maximum indoor temperature too? 
Climate change will make extreme heat events longer and more severe. In the next few decades, Riverside County will see 55 days every year in which temperatures exceed 100 degrees. By 2050, deaths from extreme heat could jump to more than 10,000 per year in California.
SB 655 could save lives. Nearly half the people in the U.S. who died from heat in the past 20 years died indoors. Many had no reliable cooling in their homes. Here in California, extreme heat caused 3,900 deaths between 2010 and 2019. Just last year in Riverside County, there were 1,627 emergency room visits and 65 deaths due to heat.   
Where I live, people use oscillating fans in addition to coolers. We put small bags of ice behind the fans so it will blow cool air. But it doesn’t cool, it just circulates humid air inside our home. It isn’t adequate, especially for small children. And it’s dangerous — you run the risk of electric shock, outages or a burnt fuse as the ice melts. 
Power outages in the summer also are becoming more frequent, due to a lousy energy infrastructure. In mid-August, we went four days without electricity. Food spoiled, down power lines blocked streets and we were left without air conditioning, coolers or fans.
How many families have to survive like this before our state leaders take meaningful action?
We need elected officials and agencies to work together to strive toward a reality where all Californians can be safe in their own homes from extreme heat and related illness and death. SB 655 would push the state toward a future where we all have the right to indoor cooling. 
Families and communities like mine can’t afford to wait.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/07132023_Extreme-Heat_DD_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

This story was originally reported The 19th.
President Donald Trump on Monday downplayed the severity of domestic violence crimes, saying that were it not for “things that take place in the home they call crime,” the administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., would have resulted in a bigger statistical reduction in crime.
“They said, ‘Crime’s down 87 percent.’ I said, no, no, no — it’s more than 87 percent, virtually nothing. And much lesser things, things that take place in the home they call crime. You know, they’ll do anything they can to find something. If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime. See? So now I can’t claim 100 percent but we are. We are a safe city,” Trump said.
The president’s comments were part of a speech he delivered at the Religious Liberty Commission’s meeting at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.
Domestic violence has long been recognized by the federal government as a national public health and safety crisis. A national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 in 10 women and 1 in 4 men have experienced physical or sexual violence or stalking by an intimate partner.
Next month marks the 25th annual Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which coincides with the 2000 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The law increased federal funding to combat domestic violence and other crimes that disproportionately affect women, recognizing the matter as a public health and safety issue, not a private domestic matter.
The federal government is by far the biggest source of funding for anti-domestic violence efforts, and since taking office, the Trump administration has sought to restrict nonprofits’ access to federal domestic violence grants. They have also laid off a top official and several teams working on the issue, threatening to destabilize domestic violence services and prevention efforts nationwide.
In a statement to The 19th, the White House said the president wasn’t “talking about or downplaying domestic violence.”
“President Trump’s Executive Order to address crime in DC even specifically took action against domestic violence,” said Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House. The order urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate housing providers who don’t comply with requirements to “restrict tenants who engage in criminal activity,” including domestic violence.
The White House also pointed out that the administration barred transgender women from women’s domestic abuse shelters, a move that advocates warn makes trans women less safe.
“While President Trump is making America safer, the Fake News is whipping up their latest hoax in real time to distract from the Administration’s tremendous results,” Jackson said.
Some groups focused on combating domestic violence criticized the president’s comments.
“The DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence believes that intimate partner violence is a crime and more than a ‘little fight with the wife’ as President Trump stated earlier today. Per federal and local statute, domestic violence is a crime and one that is not only a precursor to domestic violence homicides, but also a common factor in community violence, including mass shootings, where perpetrators often have a history of committing domestic violence,” said Dawn Dalton, the coalition’s executive director.
“The idea that domestic abuse is serious and criminal is not up for debate. Words cannot take us backwards and the days of treating domestic and sexual violence as ‘private matters’ are long gone. Any attempt to minimize these crimes does not change the impact of domestic violence and cannot change the reality of crime statistics in Washington, D.C.,” said Casey Carter Swegman, director of public policy at Tahirih Justice Center.
“By reducing domestic violence to a ‘little fight,’ President Trump revives a regressive view from an era when survivors were expected to endure abuse alone, without legal protections or public support, said Susanna Saul Director, Legal Programs at Her Justice, a nonprofit that provides free legal services to women living in poverty in New York City. “This does more than trivialize domestic abuse. It emboldens abusers to increase their violence and risks undoing decades of legal and cultural progress that have made safety a community responsibility, rather than a private burden.”
Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Wisconsin who has championed legislative efforts against domestic violence, said such crimes amount to “abuse that devastates families, endangers women and children, and takes lives every single day.”
“As a survivor of domestic violence, I found President Trump’s comments today downplaying domestic violence deeply offensive and disturbing,” she said in a statement. “Trump has a long history of violence against women that makes his dismissiveness unsurprising.”
Rep. Debbie Dingell, another survivor of domestic violence, said Trump’s comments threaten to set back the clock on the national conversation around domestic violence. “We’ve been fighting for decades to remove the stigma around domestic violence, and this position from the president directly opposes those efforts,” she said. “Let me tell you, as someone who hid in a closet many times as a child, being tough on crime means keeping women and children safe in their own homes.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2233408346-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

Currently, 22 donors have made contributions to the effort, with nine of them making the most substantial donations or pledges — $20 million each — allowing them to bear the title of “founding captains” and appearing on snowboards with crystals, resembling disco balls.
“With today’s milestone, we accomplished two things. First, we laid the financial foundation to host great games in 2034. This is essential,” said Fraser Bullock, executive chair and president of the 2034 Olympic Organizing Committee. “Second, we opened the door to be able to execute the first pillar of our vision, which is to elevate our communities.”
Utah reaches another olympic milestone — securing its organizing committee

The list of organizations donating $20 million include the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation, Robert H. and Katharine B. Garff Foundation, Huntsman Family Foundation, Maverik, Larry H. & Gail Miller Family Foundation, Ryan and Ashley Smith Foundation, The Daniels Fund, John and Marcia Price Family Foundation and Matthew and Tatiana Prince.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also made commitments to support the 2034 games, Bullock added during his remarks. Its contributions will be made public in the coming weeks.
Representatives from the contributing organizations attended the launch party on Monday sporting matching blue Olympic-themed jackets. State lawmakers, Gov. Spencer Cox and first lady Abby Cox also joined the event.
The current donations and pledges are part of a goal to raise $300 million through the initiative. With the committee’s total budget being about $4 billion to organize the games, that target sets a “fantastic foundation” for their objectives, Bullock said after the event.

The money will help funding the games, he added. But also, because it comes early, the organizers are planning to use it for community initiatives starting in 2026, like youth sports and education programs.
A program of this magnitude is a first in the history of the Olympics, Cox said on Monday.
“This has never been done. We’ve gone all the way back to ancient Greece. We’ve done it. We’ve looked. Never happened before,” he said.
The fundraising feat may show enthusiasm for the economic prospects and infrastructure projects the games may bring to the state, but mostly, Cox said, it will be a time of unity.

“The Olympics is an opportunity to share with the world who we are and what we believe in. And who we are, are people that serve and give back, that give charitably, that care more about our neighbors than we care about ourselves,” Cox said.
Referring to the founding donors of Podium34, the governor added, “You represent the very best of our state, but not just the very best of our state, the very best, of humanity, of who we are, or at least who we should be, who we’re aspiring to be. And we’re so grateful to have you in this cause.” 
The new International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, also praised the initiative in a video message, describing Utahns as “longstanding friends of the Olympic movement,” and encouraging organizers to use this momentum to nurture youth and further develop winter sport in the state.

Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, prefiled HB 8 for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January. It would allow school boards to decide whether to allow campus chaplains and teachers in public school.
Gidley has filed similar legislation in the past. The most recent version cleared the House with a vote of 91 to 4 in April but did not make it to the Senate Education Policy Committee. He said in an interview Monday that getting the bill in earlier will give it a better chance to pass.
“We were a little bit late getting it on the floor this past year. It didn’t fail in the Senate because of any problems, it just ran out of time. So I think getting it in earlier is going to help us to be able to work it through both chambers this year,” he said.
Gidley’s goal for the chaplains is that they go to the schools as needed to provide services and support for the faculty and staff in schools. He said this could help  teachers in rural counties who lack resources for mental health services.
“It could be a resource they could tap into when they may not be able to tap into other resources that could offer support,” Gidley said.
Critics of the legislation said the measure would violate the separation of church and state in schools.
Each local board of education would vote on whether to approve volunteer chaplains for schools under the measure. If approved by the board, volunteers would have to complete a “recognized chaplain training program” and a background check.
The legislation specifies that schools cannot accept a volunteer who’s been “adjudicated or convicted of an offense that requires registration as a sex offender.” 
Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, backed a similar bill last year. SB294 was passed by the Senate, but it failed to get House approval.
He said in a phone interview Thursday that chaplains are needed in schools.
“We have many situations in our schools that require a need for counseling and for support — not only for students, but for staff and teachers as well,” he said.
Chaplains would provide “support, services and programs” as requested by teachers under the measure. But Smitherman said these types of motions are not meant to replace guidance counselors.
“Some of these situations need additional assistance in the areas that those chaplains can provide,” Smitherman said. “And the guidance counselor is not for the teachers and the staff workers, so this will make it available to them as well.”
Gidley said guidance counselors and chaplains serve different functions within the school.
“They’re not even in the same category and so it’s totally absurd to even think that one would replace the other,” he said. “These chaplains are strictly there for moral, and if need be, spiritual guidance. Whatever the situation is, if somebody needs a confidential nonpartisan place to share something they could be dealing with, I think that could be extremely helpful with our teachers and administrators in the school system.”

,California,2025-09-09 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Political friction percolates over California housing policy and workers comp payouts,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/political-friction-housing-policy-workers-comp/,"In the final week of the legislative session, state and local officials are arguing over a housing density bill and how much local governments can share in workers' on-the-job injury money.","Conflict between California’s state officials and its nearly 500 cities and counties — especially over money — is nothing new.
However, relations between state and local governments these days are arguably the worst in living memory, as illustrated by a couple of issues percolating in the final week of the 2025 legislative session.
Senate Bill 79, the latest of many state efforts to force local governments to accept high-density housing projects, is one point of contention. It would essentially exempt such projects that are within a half mile of public transit services from local oversight, regardless of the building site’s local zoning.
“This is exactly where we should be building more housing, right by our highest quality transit,” says state Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill’s author.
It has drawn heavy criticism from local officials, who would lose their ability to oversee such projects, and from residents of single-family neighborhoods that could be affected. 
Opponents even include the Los Angeles City Council, dominated by Wiener’s fellow progressive Democrats. The council voted 8-5 to oppose the measure, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed on, saying cities with state-approved housing plans should be exempt. 
“While I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide, as written, this bill risks unintended consequences for LA,” Bass said.
Housing and homelessness have been especially sharp issues in relations between state and local governments ever since Gavin Newsom became governor in 2019. While campaigning for the office, Newsom pledged to jump-start housing construction and reduce the state’s large population of homeless people.
Newsom has signed numerous bills meant to spur housing construction by reducing local land use authority, and his administration has cracked down on cities that fail to designate enough land to meet state housing quotas. However, the state still falls very short of its declared level of needed housing production.
Newsom also promised to appoint a homelessness czar who would oversee programs to reduce homelessness and, after being prodded by reporters, he finally declared himself to be the czar. As homelessness levels remained high despite the state spending more than $20 billion, Newsom shifted blame to local officials for, he said, not being aggressive enough in cleaning up encampments and sheltering their inhabitants.
“I’m not interested in funding failure any longer,” he said at one point. “So I’m going to speak for myself, just one guy that’s got three more appropriation cycles in front of him. I want to see results. Everybody wants to see results.”
After threatening to cut off direct aid to local governments for homelessness programs, he signed a budget in June that suspends funding for at least a year. Local officials contend that getting one-year appropriations, without guarantees of continuity, makes it impossible for them to establish ongoing housing projects and services.
Thus, the issue is a stalemate that could continue until Newsom vacates his office 16 months hence.
In addition to these high-profile points of contention between state and local officials, there is a spate of relatively minor issues, one of which is Senate Bill 487. Sponsored by a raft of police and firefighter unions, the measure would limit the amount of money public employers could recover from their employees’ lawsuits for on-the-job injuries.
Local governments opposed the bill, saying it could potentially increase their worker compensation costs. Their opposition turned to bitter denunciation last week after state government was exempted from its impact.
“This is classic state do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do hypocrisy,” said Graham Knaus, CEO of the California State Association of Counties. “It’s a clear indication that lawmakers know this is terrible public policy, but they’re fine forcing local governments to live with it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/042220_Housing-Construction_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

BALDWIN, Mich. — Cell service begins to fade a few miles from town, as billboards advertising chain restaurants shift to roadside signs peddling used boats.
Nestled among winding rivers in a stretch of Michigan those in more populous parts call “up north,” Baldwin is a village of just over 1,000 stitched with dirt roads, boarded-up homes and “No Trespassing” signs.
A 25-foot statue of a trout watches over the main drag. And just to the north, pine trees conceal one of the most remote immigration detention centers in the country.
Here, outdoor recreation is both a lifestyle and – along with the private prison – one of the only lifelines in a place where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line.

“There isn’t a lot of opportunities for individuals here,” Lake County Sheriff Rich Martin said. “If they want to have a job, they have to go elsewhere, usually, or they have to work at a lower-paying job.”
When The GEO Group this year opened the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest down the road, the town found itself caught up in a national conversation.
President Donald Trump’s administration has launched a massive expansion of immigration detention, a crucial step toward fulfilling Trump’s pledge to carry out mass deportations. The goal is to expand capacity to hold immigrants who, in the past, often would have been released while awaiting deportation.
Federal officials want to increase the number of beds from 41,500 to 100,000 nationwide by awarding billion-dollar contracts to private prison companies, primarily GEO and CoreCivic. Both companies’ stock prices surged by more than 60% after Trump’s reelection.
“We believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to assist the federal government in meeting its expanded immigration enforcement priorities,” GEO’s CEO, Dave Donahue, said on a May call with investors.

The extensive tax and spending bill Trump signed in July gives U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement $45 billion – about five times its overall budget last year – to expand detention capacity.
“Our priority is to arrest and remove,” said John Tsoukaris, ICE field office director in Newark, New Jersey, where detention has prompted pushback and protests.
Across the U.S., some 60,000 people are being held in ICE detention — a 51% increase since January, according to the nonprofit Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
Despite Trump’s promises to target criminals, about 70% of those detained have no criminal record; many others have convictions for offenses as minor as a traffic violation.
As shuttered detention centers reopen, the communities that surround them are grappling with the consequences – questioning the morality of immigration detention, expressing concerns about shifting local identities and fighting back in the courtroom.
“We should be welcoming the stranger, not locking them up,” said Kathy O’Leary, who has led multiple demonstrations outside of Newark’s Delaney Hall, the first ICE detention center to reopen during Trump’s second term.

Even Leavenworth, Kansas, a town synonymous with prisons, is hesitant to support detaining people outside the criminal justice system.
“We are known as a prison town,” local Ashley Hernandez said. “But having an ICE detention facility … is not something that many of the residents want.”
Up in Baldwin, the expansion of immigration detention brings skepticism, too.
But it also brings hope.
 ‘When you don’t have jobs, what do you do?’

The North Lake Correctional Facility has cycled through many phases since GEO opened it in 1999. It has housed juvenile offenders, out-of-state inmates and noncitizens convicted of federal crimes. It’s also closed four different times.
Each opening brought jobs, and each shutdown left Baldwin struggling.
“It’s just not consistent, you know?” Martin said. Never mind the politics, the Republican sheriff added. The community’s more immediate concern about the windfall from North Lake is that “it doesn’t last.”
After sitting idle for three years, the 1,800-bed facility reopened in June under a new ICE contract and a new name: the North Lake Processing Center. Situated off a dirt road 3 miles from town, the detention center could easily be missed. But its economic footprint is clear.
GEO estimates the center could generate over $70 million in its first full year of operations. When open, the facility is the largest employer in Lake County; even when idle, it remains the county’s biggest taxpayer.
The hope among those backing the reopening is that those economic benefits trickle down to their wallets.
Shelly Keene, executive director of Michigan Works! West Central, which matches job seekers with employers, said even short-term jobs in Baldwin would have an impact.
“Even if an individual is employed for a year or two making a high wage, it’s better than sitting at home and not making a wage at all, or maybe waiting tables or being a bartender,” said Keene, who added that two of her former co-workers had already returned to jobs at North Lake.
In June, Keene’s organization held a hiring fair in Baldwin to help fill 500 positions at the detention center. And although GEO employees reassured potential applicants that the facility was there to stay, advocacy group No Detention Centers in Michigan notes that GEO mostly hires outsiders, with just 69 of 300 jobs going to Lake County residents the last time the facility operated.
Keene acknowledged that many locals either don’t meet GEO’s qualifications or aren’t interested, leaving the company to look outside the county for employees.
Still, she said: “Having individuals traveling in and out of Lake County, they’re spending their money at the gas stations. They’re stopping at Jones’ for ice cream. They’re going to Barski’s for dinner.”
Those who oppose the facility argue that the promised economic benefits come at too high a cost.
In June, about 150 protesters gathered at a park near Baldwin, holding signs and chanting, “No to GEO! We can do better!” The demonstration, organized by the Democratic Party in next-door Manistee County and No Detention Centers in Michigan, focused on the morality of detention.
“It’s a carceral community that holds the town hostage, and then when they’re done, they leave,” organizer Eric Lampinen said.
Lampinen, who lives about 45 miles from Baldwin, said he doesn’t judge locals who support the facility.
“I get it,” he said. “When you don’t have jobs, what do you do?”
In an email to News21, a GEO spokesperson said: “We are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” adding that GEO follows federal regulations that “set strict requirements on the treatment and services ICE detainees receive.”
Sara Maddox is a waitress at Shoey’s Log Bar – a “Baldwin staple for nearly 100 years!” as its Facebook page boasts. At the horseshoe-shaped bar, Maddox laughs with regulars and greets them by name.
She thinks most of the opposition to the new detention center is coming from outsiders. “The protests don’t exactly show the way that we feel here,” she said.
A few of her friends applied at North Lake, drawn by one of the area’s few jobs with strong benefits. At the same time, Maddox remembers how takeout orders dropped by almost 15% when North Lake closed in 2022.
“We’re excited for the growth, but I think the up and down of the North Lake facility, the opening and the closing, has taken its toll on the community,” she said.
Lake County is Trump country. Some 65% of residents voted for him over Kamala Harris. For residents such as Debbie Russell, though, the detention debate isn’t about politics – it’s about the needs of her neighbors.
Russell has lived in Baldwin for more than 50 years and works at her daughter’s fabrics shop. While she does not fully agree with how the administration is handling immigration, she supports the reopening of North Lake.
“I just hope they stay open and it goes on for a while,” she said.

Communities in at least eight states, some deep red, others the bluest of blue, are navigating the reopening of detention centers, several of which have histories of abuse.
At least four places — Newark, Leavenworth, New York City and Washington state — have challenged the expansion of immigration detention, in some cases by citing local ordinances. Leavenworth, for instance, is suing CoreCivic for trying to reopen a facility without obtaining a special use permit.
But nowhere is the opposition more fervent than in New Jersey – a state where one in four residents is an immigrant.
 ‘Families are disrupted and communities are harmed’

The Statue of Liberty welcomes ships from the Atlantic as they enter New York Harbor but turns her back on Newark, where immigration detention spreads in her shadow.
Just 5 miles behind her lies GEO-owned Delaney Hall and its razor wire fences. From its doorstep, petrochemical storage vats block the view to the Passaic River. Garbage trucks rumble past, headed for the state’s largest trash incinerator up the road. And if the wind blows just right, the faint smell of burning flesh lingers from a nearby animal fat rendering plant.
This area, northeast of Newark Liberty International Airport, is zoned specifically for heavy industry. No one is supposed to live here. Hotels, community centers and even animal shelters are prohibited. The only “residential” buildings allowed are Delaney Hall and the Essex County Correctional Facility.
Delaney, which operated as an ICE detention facility from 2011 to 2017, can hold about 1,000 people, dwarfing the only other immigration detention center in the state by 700 beds. GEO reopened it May 1, despite yearslong efforts in New Jersey to put a stop to immigration detention.
In 2021, lawmakers banned state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention, and several facilities ceased operations. CoreCivic sued, and a judge ruled that while New Jersey may limit state and local entities, it cannot prohibit private companies from doing business with ICE.
The city of Newark has also challenged detention. In an April complaint, officials alleged Delaney Hall was a danger to staff and detainees because GEO wouldn’t allow the city to inspect the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. GEO called the lawsuit “politically motivated.” The case is still pending even as operations at Delaney persist.

In the first month and a half after the facility reopened, tensions boiled over twice. First came a scuffle that resulted in the arrest of Newark’s mayor and the indictment of a congresswoman – both Democrats – who were trying to inspect the facility. In the second, four men escaped amid a clash between guards and detainees who were upset over conditions.
“Any sort of detention environment is obviously not going to present with good conditions, but private detention facilities are worried about their bottom line – profits are really their goal,” said Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
GEO declined to respond directly to emailed questions, but said in a statement that its support services are monitored by ICE and other organizations within the Department of Homeland Security to “ensure strict compliance.”
The company said it provides services that include “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietician-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice … religious beliefs.”
GEO referred questions to ICE; the agency’s national office did not respond to requests for comment.
Tsoukaris, the Newark ICE director, said he doesn’t understand why people are protesting facilities such as Delaney Hall.
“If you’re here illegally and you’re committing crimes, I don’t know why some people think it’s OK,” Tsoukaris said, despite statistics that show a majority of those detained have no significant criminal record. “You’re allowed to protest. But why are you protesting?”

Leaving the facility one morning in June, K.B., an American citizen who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing her nursing job, led her toddler son toward their car.
She had just finished visiting her husband of two years, who has been in the country for the past 21. Originally from Brazil, he was detained based on a 2005 deportation order, which a lawyer had been working to get dismissed, K.B. said.
Their situation reflects a new reality for immigrants without legal status. A year ago, ICE probably would have ignored someone like K.B.’s husband, who she said has no criminal record. If he had been detained, he likely would have been released pending resolution of the deportation order.
K.B. said her husband’s work as a general contractor accounted for the vast majority of their combined $120,000 income.
“We’d do everything like a family,” she said through tears. “Now, it’s totally changed. I’m starting to feel the burden of taking all of the responsibilities: taking care of the house, the bills, having to work and now having to find child care.”
Advocates worry K.B.’s story could become more common.
Said Linhorst of the ACLU: “The more detention beds we get, the more people are detained, which means the more families are disrupted and communities are harmed.”
 A prison town’s identity is put to the test

With its historical landmarks and Victorian homes flying U.S. flags, Leavenworth radiates small-town Americana.
As the first incorporated city of Kansas, the community carries multiple identities: a town rooted in military tradition and pioneer history, yet nationally known for the five prisons scattered around town.
“It’s the tenacity of the people that really defines Leavenworth,” said Ashley Hernandez, who works with the local Sisters of Charity. “Leavenworth is not made up of a bunch of people that are willing to just roll back and let something happen.”
Now, that identity is being put to the test.
CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the Leavenworth Detention Center under a contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 people. The city has sued, leading to a temporary injunction blocking the facility from reopening without a permit.
Frustrated by the national attention, City Manager Scott Peterson said the city’s stance is not political, but simply a land use issue.
“There’s more to this town than just a fight with a CoreCivic facility – and more to this town than the prisons,” he said.

Yet prisons have long shaped the town’s narrative, economically and culturally.
After the Fort Leavenworth U.S. Army base and the Veterans Affairs hospital, prisons are Leavenworth’s third-largest employer. Home to the nation’s oldest federal penitentiary, the city of 37,000 has housed infamous figures such as Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly.
CoreCivic’s ties to Leavenworth run deep. Its CEO, Damon Hininger, was born in the city and started his career as a corrections officer at the Leavenworth Detention Center, which opened in 1992 to house people awaiting trial on federal charges.
CoreCivic began talks with Leavenworth County officials about reopening the detention center during the Biden administration, but some residents pushed back over rumors that migrants would be processed and then released into town while they awaited court proceedings.
In its new proposal, CoreCivic promised that “no ICE detainees will be released into the Leavenworth community.”
The Leavenworth Detention Center — now rebranded as the Midwest Regional Reception Center — faced years of scrutiny. A 2017 Department of Justice report found it dangerously understaffed, with an officer vacancy rate as high as 23%.
Opposition has coalesced into a grassroots coalition of residents and immigration advocates who meet weekly in a grocery store Starbucks. They organize public panels, attend City Commission meetings and hold “teach-ins” to explore ways to “keep CoreCivic’s doors closed.”
At one recent panel, about 90 people gathered to protest the reopening, listening as former CoreCivic employees shared accounts of violence and neglect.
“The job is not worth it,” said attendee Muñeca Nieves, who volunteers with an immigrant advocacy organization. “They may pay well, but at what risk?”

Joining the fight are the Catholic nuns at the Sisters of Charity, who have been speaking out at news conferences and holding prayer vigils.
“Our sisters have been moved, in a way that I haven’t seen them moved before, toward action,” said Rebecca Metz, who directs the social justice advocacy office for the Sisters of Charity in Leavenworth. “This has really set a fire in their sails, and they’re ready.”
In an emailed statement, CoreCivic acknowledged past challenges at its Leavenworth facility but objected to “broad and generalized criticisms of the conditions in which our facilities operate.”
“Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process that they are entitled to,” wrote company spokesman Ryan Gustin. “All our immigration facilities operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability.”
Despite growing opposition, Leavenworth remains a town of contrasts, given that some residents support the reopening of the facility.
Jason Claire, who runs a military antiques and surplus shop, said he welcomes the expansion as an opportunity for a struggling downtown.
Claire said city officials are too focused on shaping Leavenworth’s image, rather than addressing its economic challenges. He pointed to recent efforts by leaders to rebrand Leavenworth as the “First City of Kansas,” a nod to its more charming pioneer roots.
“They’ve worked to keep it from being just a prison town,” Claire said. “But when you get down to soup and nuts, it’s a prison town.”

In 2024, 60% of Leavenworth County voted for Trump, and like some residents of Baldwin, Claire believes the most vocal opposition to detention comes from a politically motivated group of outsiders.
“They’re shooting themselves, and our community, in the foot, because it’s an opportunity to help spur the city and get it going,” Claire said.
Despite Claire’s stance, about 90% of the more than two dozen people who addressed the facility at City Commission meetings from February to June spoke against it, according to a News21 review of meeting minutes.
The legal battle continues, but for many, the fight is about more than proper permitting or economic opportunity.
The debate has exposed a deeper reckoning over the moral cost of immigration detention in America — and whether a town long defined by incarceration is willing to profit from another chapter of it.
“We’re taking away children’s parents,” said Sister Therese Bangert, a member of the Sisters of Charity. “We’re just causing anguish to lock them up. And then some people, like CoreCivic, are making money on it.”

Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless. (Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images)The confusion and commotion over cryptocurrency often reminds me of the 19th-century German drama Faust. In Goethe’s masterpiece, the devil Mephistopheles offers an emperor the tantalising vision of limitless wealth through the printing of paper money.
The emperor grasps the idea (unheard of at the time the play is set), and the magical wealth which paper creates brings brief prosperity to his troubled dominion.
But what appeared to be an inexhaustible source of value soon proves illusory. A combination of misunderstanding and hype leads to economic and moral corruption, and the empire descends into chaos.
It is a tale which could well have parallels for digital currencies now. People use them despite not fully understanding how they work, sometimes to their financial loss.
And history shows us that we should be wary of the idea that currency systems always change for the better, following some sort of natural evolutionary path. In fact, new currency systems don’t always succeed, and even when they do, monetary regime change can be a long and arduous process.
Coins and tokens were used more than 2,000 years ago, and continued through to the 19th century before paper finally dominated. Rather than a clean, irreversible shift from coins to notes, nations often alternated between the two systems.
There were failed experiments with paper money in 14th-century China, 17th-century Sweden and 18th-century France, to mention just a few.
Research on these problematic attempts suggests that social division also makes new currency shifts especially vulnerable.
During the American war of independence for example, a currency (the “continental dollar”) was briefly introduced in 1775. It was later abandoned due to mismanagement and misunderstanding, but had also served to sharpen political tensions between the patriots who supported it, and the loyalists to Britain, who detested it.
Similarly, in the 1750s and 1760s, the Swedish government issued non-redeemable paper money to pay its war debts. The consequent extreme inflation coincided with intense social division and led to a period of political chaos.
In 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, a paper form of government bond was issued, which rapidly lost its value. Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless.
Britain fared slightly better, as I explore in my book The Age of Paper. Its departure from the metal standard in 1797, amid the financial pressures of the Anglo–French war, did not produce a collapse of the nation’s paper currency.
But the paper-based regime came to a halt in 1819, a year of bitter class conflicts, which culminated in the Peterloo massacre, where at least 18 people were killed and hundreds wounded by the cavalry at a peaceful rally for democratic reform. The public had come to detest Bank of England notes, which became a symbol of economic depression and political oppression.
Britain then followed the pattern of other nations, reverting to a traditional monetary system that rested on the solid value of precious metals.
These cases of failed paper currencies – and there are many more – show that the general acceptance of currency ultimately requires shared values and social solidarity. Paper currency works when people trust it, knowing that it has been valued and accepted by others in the past, and will be valued and accepted in the future.
It would otherwise be unlikely for a piece of paper to become a reliable means of payment and value. Once such shared values are lost, there is usually a downward cycle of currency depreciation.
 Cryptic currency

In the 21st-century, cryptocurrencies challenge the conventional idea of money as something of value – or at least linked to something of value, like gold. And as something that is issued and managed by a trusted central authority.
For cryptocurrencies exist only in the realm of blockchain technology. Their value is created and maintained not by central banks, but by complex computer algorithms.
To many, all of these abstract computational processes make cryptocurrencies as mysterious as Mephistopheles’ dark magic in Faust.
Even so, with Donald Trump’s strong support, cryptocurrencies are enjoying a surge in popularity. This trend will undoubtedly be reinforced by further deregulation which means requirements for transparency will be relaxed, and safeguards for consumer protection weakened.
The rise in popularity has coincided with the US government’s apparent preference for weakening the dollar in the international currency markets as a way of boosting US exports by pushing down the prices of US goods abroad.
These events may lead to a profound transformation in the monetary system on a global scale. As the US dollar loses value and crypto regulations are relaxed, countries and investors around the world may be enticed to diversify their assets and increase their holdings of cryptocurrency.
But the combination of social division and rapid expansion may not be a positive sign for the future of cryptocurrency. Far from establishing it as a dominant medium of exchange in a new decentralised regime, history suggests that its rapid growth in a fractured society might instead accelerate its self-destruction.

(Photo courtesy American Wild Horse Conservation)America’s wild horses have faced competition from livestock, unfair resource allocation, and shrinking habitat for generations. The federal government’s response has been traumatic and controversial, including helicopter roundups at taxpayer expense. These roundups have proven ineffective in the long term, yet they continue, despite the outrageous cost.
Nevada’s Virginia Range is home to a treasured population of wild horses facing a shrinking habitat because of human and industrial encroachment. The Virginia Range, just east of Reno, is also home to the world’s largest wild horse fertility control program, proving another path is possible — and it’s working. American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC) is leading the way in humanely reversing wild horse population growth through its self-funded fertility control program. Having recently finished its sixth year (and beginning year seven), the program has achieved something remarkable: an 82 percent reduction in foal births between January-June 2025 compared to the same period in 2020.
Seeking to demonstrate that well-researched fertility control could be scaled up, the results of AWHC’s work were analyzed, peer-reviewed and published in the journal Vaccines last year, marking the most successful wild horse fertility control program of its size in the United States — if not the world.
The Virginia Range program uses an immunocontraceptive vaccine known as PZP (porcine zona pellucida). Administered by trained volunteers via remote darting, PZP prevents pregnancy in mares without harming hormone cycles or behaviors, and it’s reversible. Unlike roundups, it doesn’t traumatize or remove horses from their habitat.
The scale of this effort is significant. 
More than 40 community volunteers have worked across almost 300,000 acres to reach over 70 percent of reproductive-age mares. Combined with natural attrition and predation, their efforts have begun to reduce the overall population in areas where darting is consistently applied. These results are impressive, and they prove that humane management without cruel and costly helicopter roundups is a viable option for our nation’s wild herds.
Notably, the program operates without state or federal funding. Local businesses, including Blockchains Inc. and the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, have helped support access and logistics, making it a model of public-private cooperation. It’s a humane, scientifically sound, and fiscally responsible approach. And yet it remains the exception, not the rule.
Despite $11 million of funding made available by Congress, federal agencies, particularly the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), have yet to embrace fertility control as a primary management strategy. 
Instead, they continue to round up thousands of wild horses each year and house them in long-term holding facilities, where many remain for life, at 30 times the cost per horse of in-the-wild fertility control. 
The USA now has more wild horses in captivity than running free on the rangelands in the West.
According to government reports, this system now consumes over two-thirds of the BLM’s wild horse and burro budget, costing taxpayers $100 million annually.
There is no denying that wild horse management is complex. Habitats are shrinking due to development, drought, and competing land uses. But as AWHC’s Virginia Range project shows, compassionate and cost-effective solutions already exist — and they’re scalable. What’s lacking is the political will to shift away from outdated and inhumane practices toward methods that are proven to work.
If the federal government is serious about reforming wild horse management, it should look west to Nevada, where a group of citizen scientists and volunteers is making history.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tracy-Wilson-d-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

Help protect Vermont’s lakes and ponds. Stop mowing and plant a garden.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pat Suozzi: Vermont lakes and streams like fewer lawns, too! .","This commentary is by Pat Suozzi, of Hinesburg. Suozzi is the president of the Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds.


In the recent opinion piece “Vermonters Get Rid of Your Lawns,” author Lucie Lehmann describes the wonderful transformation that took place when she removed her lawn and planted native perennials and grasses. Her yard came alive with color, attracting all sorts of birds, butterflies, native bees and more. She describes many of the benefits of doing this, including reduction in the use of pesticides.
I would like to add another very important benefit of less lawn: improving the health of Vermont’s lakes and streams.
Grass with its shallow roots does not absorb much rainwater. However, native plants, shrubs and trees, with their deeper root systems, are far more absorbent, which significantly reduces stormwater runoff. 

READ MORE

Even if you live far from a lake or stream, runoff from a lawn — laden with nutrients, sediment and other pollutants — will end up in a nearby stream and eventually into one of the state’s 800 lakes and ponds.The nutrients, consisting mainly of phosphorus, contribute to creating the toxic cyanobacteria blooms that have closed so many beaches along Lake Champlain and on other lakes in the state. Stormwater flowing across your lawn can also erode roads, carrying that dirt and gravel along with salts and other pollutants into the lakes and streams. 
Removing lawns and planting native species can help to reduce this pollution, protect water quality and bring you the pleasure of a garden full of life that will require little to no mowing and give you more leisure time to get out and enjoy a nearby lake. 
Interested but not sure how to get started? We can help.
The Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds has published a landscaping booklet that includes a variety of landscape design templates and planting plans, lists of native plants, shrubs, and trees, as well as maintenance tips. While this was created mainly for lake shore property owners, all of the designs, native plant lists and maintenance tips are completely relevant to anyone who would like to change their lawn desert into a garden.

(Courtesy of New Jersey Institute of Technology)A federal appeals panel has determined that a New Jersey university was wrong to deny a philosophy professor continued employment after learning he praised Adolf Hitler and made other controversial comments outside the classroom.
Judge Paul Matey of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Jason Reza Jorjani’s off-campus comments were protected by the First Amendment and did not disrupt the New Jersey Institute of Technology’s educational mission, as it claimed.
Matey, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, cited a 2021 federal ruling that sided with an Ohio professor disciplined for refusing to use a transgender student’s preferred pronouns.
“In essence, NJIT posits that because Jorjani offered views it disliked, the First Amendment should not apply,” Matey wrote. “We cannot agree, lest we permit ‘universities to discipline professors, students, and staff any time their speech might cause offense.’”
The 13,000-student university in Newark hired Jorjani in 2015 and renewed his contract in 2016 and 2017. But administrators placed him on paid leave after a New York Times column and video revealed he had made controversial comments about Hitler, race, and immigration, and that he had founded an alt-right corporation and website with white nationalist Richard Spencer.
The university’s president and a dean emailed faculty and staff denouncing Jorjani’s comments, the Faculty Senate issued a statement declaring his views “morally repugnant,” and the school fielded about 50 emailed complaints, according to the ruling. Various departments raised concerns about his views creating a “hostile learning environment” on a campus with a sizeable enrollment of students of color, and administrators accused Jorjani of ethical breaches for failing to mention his alt-right ties in required “association with organizations” disclosures, the ruling said.
The school hired a law firm to investigate, and administrators ultimately decided against renewing his contract, according to the ruling.
Jorjani sued in July 2018, claiming retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. A U.S. District Court judge dismissed his case last year, saying that his speech wasn’t protected by the First Amendment because the school’s “interest in mitigating the disruption caused by Plaintiff’s speech … outweighs Plaintiff’s interest in its expression.”
But Matey said that ruling was “an error,” citing a famous dissent from a 1929 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that defended unpopular political speech.
“Jorjani’s speech occurred entirely outside NJIT’s academic environs. His theories, even if lacking in classical rigor, remain of public import,” Matey wrote. “It matters not that his opinions do not enjoy majoritarian support, since ‘the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘the thought that we hate.'”
College students have an “interest in hearing even contrarian views,” Matey wrote, again citing the Ohio case. The university’s claim that Jorjani’s views were disruptive to the college community was “speculative,” Matey added, noting that they did not incite student protests or upheaval.
Monday’s ruling revives Jorjani’s retaliation claim. Jorjani did not respond to a request for comment. Matthew Golden, a university spokesman, declined to comment.
Matey was nominated to the federal bench by President Donald Trump. He was joined in Monday’s opinion by Judge Peter Phipps, another Trump appointee, and Judge Cheryl Ann Krause, a nominee of Barack Obama.

The bill passed and was signed into law. (Photo by Michele Jokinen/Session Daily)Minnesota House Democrats picked Rep. Zack Stephenson as their new caucus leader Monday, signaling a desire for continuity after the assassination of their late leader Melissa Hortman in June. 
Stephenson, who has represented the Coon Rapids area in the House since 2019, was Hortman’s 2004 campaign manager as an inexperienced, early 20s college student. Hortman was a mentor to Stephenson for 20 years, teaching him about campaigning, fundraising and serving a Twin Cities metro swing district. Stephenson was also a good friend of Hortman’s and served as a pallbearer during her funeral.
In a closed-door meeting, Stephenson garnered votes from the majority of the 66 House Democrats. The circumstances of Hortman’s death made choosing her successor challenging, but multiple contenders campaigned for it, including DFL floor leader Jamie Long and Reps. Tina Liebling, Dave Pinto and Cheryl Youakim.
“I am honored to have the support of my colleagues to serve as caucus leader,” Stephenson said in a statement released by House DFL Monday. “Speaker Hortman is irreplaceable — as a leader, a strategist, a colleague and a friend. While I’ve been chosen to lead, it will take all of us, working together, to move forward, honor Speaker Hortman’s legacy, and build a Minnesota where everyone can succeed. We are all still grieving, but I am confident we can carry our shared work into the future.”
Stephenson is likely to follow Hortman’s well-thumbed political playbook: raise money, recruit sound candidates and incessantly knock on doors.
The House is expected to return to a 67-67 tie between Republicans and Democrats after a Sept. 16 special election to replace Hortman in a solidly blue suburban Brooklyn Park district. Stephenson will need to negotiate with Republicans to pass any legislation, deftly say “no” to unrealistic member demands of his own caucus and raise piles of money to campaign in 2026.
If House Democrats take back control of the House next year, Stephenson will be a frontrunner for House speaker.
Rep. Aisha Gomez, the co-chair of the House Taxes Committee and a leader of the left flank of the party, called Stephenson “smart, tough, capable, empathetic,” in a text message to the Reformer. “He studied at (Hortman’s) side and she trusted him completely. He wants to do right by her and by us and the people of our state. Our caucus is united behind him and collectively we have a lot of brilliance and heart to bring to the work ahead of us.”
Stephenson served as a House Ways and Means committee co-chair this year, putting him at the center of budget negotiations with legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz. He’s also compiled a significant legislative resume, including authorship of the House bill legalizing cannabis in 2023 and a bevy of consumer protections enacted when he was chair of the commerce committee in 2023-24. 
Stephenson is also a Hennepin County prosecutor. 
Stephenson will have to hit the ground running: Walz said he will call a special session on gun control following the Aug. 27 mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, and Stephenson will need to work with House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, to pass any sort of gun or school safety measures. 
Hortman and her husband Mark were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a political assassination by a man who was targeting Democratic elected officials and abortion rights advocates, prosecutors say. Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were severely injured but survived a shooting by the same man, according to charging papers, at their Champlin home on the same night.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/021524-PHOTO-judiciary-MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-09 09:56:16.994865

(IDOA)A program that aims to bring more minority and women-owned businesses into the state’s procurement system is facing possible elimination.
Gov. Mike Braun’s administration sought an advisory opinion Aug. 26 from the Attorney General’s Office on the legality of the Governor’s Commission on Supplier Diversity and the continued implementation of the Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises Program.
The move comes after the state abruptly cancelled its 2025 Business Conference and B2Bloom Expo. The 17th annual gathering, hosted by the Indiana Department of Administration’s Division of Supplier Diversity, showcased opportunities for underrepresented companies to contract with state government.
The agency declined to share why the October conference was cancelled, only saying, “Further details will be shared when they become available.”
A Sunday Facebook post from the Division of Supplier Diversity provided more information on the request while also postponing the group’s third quarter meeting set for Monday.
“Governor Braun requested that the supplier diversity commission meeting be postponed due to pending legal review of the program from the Attorney General. In an effort to save taxpayers money and commissioners their time, the next meeting will be scheduled with appropriate notice following the receipt of the legal opinion.”

The division set participation goals. For instance, the most recent goal was for minority-owned businesses to average 8% across construction, goods and services and professional services contracts; and women receiving 10% of the contracts.
Veteran-owned businesses are also a part of the program, but are not part of the legal review.
The group also tracks disparity between the participation of these groups in the state procurement system.
The request from Department of Administration Commissioner Brandon Clifton is based on a 2023 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States striking down the use of race in college admissions.
It also quotes a 2025 memorandum from the U.S. Attorney General giving guidance on unlawful discrimination for federal funding recipients.
“In recent years, the federal government has turned a blind eye toward, or even encouraged, various discriminatory practices, seemingly because of their purportedly benign labels, objectives, or intentions. No longer. Going forward, the federal government will not stand by while recipients of federal funds engage in discrimination,” the memo said.
It further stated that programs can’t discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, or other protected characteristics — no matter the program’s labels, objectives, or intentions.
Clifton’s request to the Attorney General asked to determine the legality of the entire diversity business program, as well as whether the division must comply with state law requiring a five-year diversity study of contracts. That study is due this year.
Based on the response, Clifton asked if “an alternative program that focused on characteristics such as veterans’ status, small business status, and businesses domiciled in Indiana or with Indiana workers comply with the requirements set forth in current federal law?”
Another question was whether it’s permissible for the state to continue to honor contracts for which requests for proposals have been issued prior to the issuance of an opinion by the Indiana Attorney General’s Office.
It is unclear the timeline for that opinion, which is non-binding.

From the vantage of the 2020s, there’s something quaint about the political style of Martin Olav Sabo. 
A leading Minnesota legislator and congressman of the late 20th century, Sabo was a shoe-leather, door-to-door candidate who never aired an attack ad or publicly slung a demeaning epithet at an opponent. He was a student of the “inside baseball” of the legislative branch of government — calendars, committee assignments, fiscal notes, office space. (And yes, he also studied baseball.) 
He cared not just about what government did but also about how it performed and which level of government was best suited to the task at hand. He didn’t just refuse to demonize members of the opposite party. He befriended them and encouraged their participation in decision-making.
Those characteristics may sound like the practices of an earlier time. But that does not mean they should be dismissed or forgotten. This book was born of a conviction that the Sabo story is worth telling amid the cutthroat partisanship that characterizes 21st century American politics. The anxiety many Americans feel about their system of government makes now an apt time to examine the life and work of someone who showed that it is indeed possible to make that system perform “for the better.” 

Martin Sabo was an institutionalist. But immutable preservation of the Minnesota or the United States houses of representatives was never his goal. He sought those bodies’ improvement (he was too modest — and realistic — to claim that he sought their perfection) for the sake of making them better able to deliver the public services he believed Americans deserved.
When he concluded that institutional rules and norms needed to change to better meet society’s needs, he willingly led the charge to make those changes. But when critics denigrated those institutions or sought to make them dysfunctional — particularly for personal or partisan gain — he rose to their defense. 
Despite his lifelong attachment to those two elective bodies, he understood that they belonged not to him but to the people. His role was one of stewardship. 
…
As many examples both ancient and modern attest, representative democracy isn’t easy. The leadership required to make that system of government effective is not typically in abundant supply — and when such leaders arise, they are not always appreciated by voters. 
But this book asserts that when someone of keen mind and good heart, someone like Martin Sabo, chooses to make representative democracy his life’s work, an admirable result can ensue. That kind of career politician deserves citizens’ respect — and their votes.
Editor’s note: The following passage is from the book’s conclusion: 
The man who approached me to write this book at the behest of a group of Sabo friends wanted to lift up something more than public policy. 
“I’m hung up on leadership,” said Bill Kelly, a former DFL legislator who served with Sabo. “I know no one more intent than Martin was on making the system work better for all the right reasons.”
At age 82 in 2022, Kelly was ailing with the cancer that would take his life on July 31, 2023. Like his friend Sabo, Kelly had a lifelong love affair with representative democracy. As Sabo did at the end of his life, Kelly was watching with dismay as elected officials often appeared to put short-term electoral advantage ahead of the long-term interests of the state and nation.
Winning the next election was never Sabo’s ultimate goal, Kelly said. Good governance was. The temptations of political expediency — the demonizing of opponents, the twisting of facts into half-truths and even lies, the shilling for campaign donors — were to be avoided because they undermined good governance.
“Martin’s view came out of his North Dakota experience, growing up in a small town. You give a damn about the whole thing. Not just your own career or your own glory. It’s, ‘How does the whole place function? What can you do to make that better?’ That’s what he educated us about,” Kelly said.
That’s what leadership in American government should be about.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090113mej087_001-1.jpg,,,2025-09-09 09:56:16.994865

In an interview with The Independent shortly after taking the oath of office in a private ceremony in Jefferson City, Hanaway said now-former Attorney General Andrew Bailey was committed to upholding the constitution and protecting the rights of Missourians. 
But as Missouri’s fourth attorney general in six years, Hanaway made it clear her approach to the office is “going to be a different style.”
She expressed little interest in headline-grabbing lawsuits or cable-news hits. Her focus, she said, will be things like Medicaid fraud, consumer protection and violent crimes. 
“Instead of ‘we defend the state of Missouri,’ I think it’s even better to say that ‘we defend Missourians,’” she said. “Of course it’s important to defend the Constitution, but I do want to do the cases that might have an impact on just a person or a couple of people who’ve been victims.”

That kind of change would be a welcome one after years of attorneys general using the office to “make a name for themselves in the news and bow down to the Trump agenda,” said state Rep. Jaclyn Zimmermann, a Democrat from Manchester, who clerked for a federal judge when Hanaway was serving as a U.S. attorney. She said Democrats are cautiously optimistic about the change in leadership.
Bailey resigned to become co-deputy director of the FBI. His two predecessors — Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt — resigned early, too, for seats in the U.S. Senate. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe appointed Hanaway with the expectation she will be the first attorney general in more than a decade to stick around for more than an election cycle. Hanaway vowed when she was announced as attorney general to serve out the rest of Bailey’s term and seek a full term of her own in 2028. 
“The leadership capacity that she brings to the attorney general’s office, I would say, is second to none, and the breadth of her experience is second to none,” said John Hancock, a veteran GOP consultant and former party leader. “I fully expect that she’s going to be a remarkable attorney general.”
 Longtime Missouri attorney, politician

Catherine Hanaway talks to reporters on Aug. 19 after being announced as the state’s next attorney general (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Hanaway’s journey began as a grassroots effort.
“She was a suburban woman who basically started by going door to door and helped shift the majority in Missouri,” said Jean Evans, a former GOP lawmaker from St. Louis County who also served as leader of the state party. 
After graduating from The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law, Hanaway kicked off her career at a big law firm. Not long after, at the age of 34 and with a 6-month-old in tow, she was elected to the Missouri House. 
Her career as a lawmaker was marked by Missouri’s shift to a Republican majority. After working as the House minority leader, Hanaway was part of the Republican celebrations in 2002 when Republicans took the majority after 48 years of Democratic control. Hanaway became the first — and so far, only — woman speaker of the Missouri House. 
“When you enter the legislature, her name is like the gold standard of what it takes to be a leader in the Republican Party,” Evans said.
She ran unsuccessfully for Missouri secretary of state in 2004. The next year, President George W. Bush appointed Hanaway to be U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. 
While the job requires coordination with the FBI, Secret Service and DEA, Hanaway said she made a point of connecting with law enforcement in the 47 counties outside of St. Louis that were also under her jurisdiction because “their taxpayers deserve the same level of service that people in downtown St. Louis got.”
In that role, Hanaway’s office was particularly focused on devoting more resources child exploitation cases, prosecuting those who manufactured methamphetamine and punishing Medicaid and Medicare fraud. 
She also oversaw the prosecution of Michael Devlin, who was found guilty of abducting and abusing two boys in St. Louis County. It’s a case that’s stayed with her this past decade. And an example of ways she said she can help individual Missourians find justice.
“I can’t think of anybody that’s come into that position with a better pedigree,” said Hancock, noting the significance of her time managing large public and private sector legal teams as she takes over an office that has struggled with recruitment and retention. 
She ran again for statewide office in 2016, losing in the GOP gubernatorial primary to the man who would go on to be governor, Eric Greitens. 
When Greitens was facing impeachment and criminal charges a little more than a year later, Hanway joined his legal team. 
“I didn’t defend Eric personally,” Hanaway said Monday. “I represented his campaign and his 501c4 which meant that there were a whole lot of young staffers and other people who were getting investigated, interviewed by law enforcement authorities, and I was really providing representation to them. I’m glad that none of those people ended up with any penalties. I’m proud that I was able to defend them.”
Until her appointment as attorney general, Hanaway was a partner at Husch Blackwell in St. Louis. 
There, she was lead counsel representing Grain Belt Express — a planned transmission line designed to take wind farm-generated electricity across the Midwest  under investigation by the attorney general’s office. The company filed a lawsuit accusing Bailey’s office of an “unlawful and politically motivated investigation.” 
Hanaway, who is recusing herself from the case, said there’s not much she can comment on regarding Grain Belt. 
 A change in leadership

Both Republicans and Democrats are hopeful Hanaway can finally bring stability to the attorney general’s office.
“I can’t think of any attorney general in the history of Missouri who has had more experience than Hanaway in running a big law firm,” said Chuck Hatfield, a longtime Democratic attorney who called Hanaway’s resume in leadership “unmatched” and her network “amazing.”
Hatfield, who is often tapped to argue high-profile cases against the attorney general’s office,  said Hanaway’s experience will likely prove valuable in an office that’s had regular issues with turnover and morale.
Most recently, Bailey faced criticism that he mismanaged the office, resulting in missed deadlines and staff turnover — including from some of the highest profile lawyers in the office. 
“I’m quite optimistic that we’re going to see the quality of the legal work improve,” Hatfield said, adding: “The attorney general needs to be the spokesperson for the state in court, and the court needs to think that they’re very credible and that the attorney general is always going to have something worth saying.”
New Missouri attorney general inherits more than 120 pending Sunshine Law requests

Hanaway said she hopes to make the office even more appealing to attorneys, citing the frequency with which attorneys from the office go on to become judges.
“If this is a place where you can come and get qualified to be a judge, that’s pretty cool,” she said. “So the quality of the people here, I think, is really at an all time high, and we do need more of them.”
She also commended her three predecessors on focusing on recruiting top talent for constitutional cases. 
“Where you might see a little bit of a shift from me is not at all on which issues we’re doing,” she said, “it’s to focus a little bit more on the career people who do everything else in the office.”
Hanaway promised to continue Bailey’s fight against public corruption, saying that she will prioritize his cases against St. Louis Sheriff Alfred Montgomery and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page.
Hanaway said she is considering lending assistant attorneys general to jurisdictions she believes need help, including in Kansas City. She also plans to go after “Delta-8,” an intoxicating hemp product that she and others have said are being sold unlicensed and with no age restrictions in gas stations across the state.
Bailey has said that winning a $24 billion judgement against the Chinese Communist Party for the spread of COVID-19 is one of his biggest accomplishments. Hanaway said she is committed to figuring out what assets of the Chinese government can be collected on behalf of Missourians.
Bailey’s office was also aggressive in its attacks on abortion. Hanaway pointed to an ongoing lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood against the state that challenges current abortion regulations, also known as TRAP laws, as the most important abortion-related case before her.
“I support the law that is currently on the books in Missouri,” she said. “ …  we just want to do everything that we can to protect life and to support women who make that really difficult choice to keep an unexpected pregnancy.”
Hanaway grew up in Nebraska and Iowa, but has long been a Missourian. 
She said Missourians are the state motto — “show me” — personified. 
“People are just real, and they don’t have a tolerance for you being fake,” Hanaway said. “I love that, and you got to prove it to them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/54774073341_c5eef6e9dd_k-e1757371207765-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-09 06:56:55.153683

There are two programs, Medicaid Emergency Services and BadgerCare Plus Prenatal Plan, that will provide coverage for those without legal status. (Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)A Republican bill that seeks to stop Wisconsin from using public funds to support health services for immigrants who lack legal authorization to reside in the U.S. is poised to advance on Tuesday. 
The bill — AB 308 — would prohibit state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the U.S.
It is the latest bill that Republican lawmakers have introduced targeting immigrants. Another bill introduced and passed earlier this year seeks to require local law enforcement officers to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The bill is coauthored by Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan) and Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) and currently has 25 other Republican cosponsors. No Democrats are signed onto the bill. 
During the bill hearing last week, Dallman focused mostly on Wisconsin’s Medicaid program, BadgerCare, arguing that he wants to prevent the state from ever taking steps similar to Minnesota and other states that expanded their Medicaid programs to cover immigrants who lack legal status. Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal authorization to apply to BadgerCare.
In 2023, Minnesota expanded its Medicaid program to cover residents without citizenship or legal residency status, but that was repealed after Republicans threatened a government shutdown to force Democrats to eliminate the expansion. 
The cost estimate for the program was nearly $200 million, Dallman noted.
“These are enormous price tags for individuals who are not here lawfully. This condition should not be the case here in Wisconsin with a state budget that is currently already very lean,” Dallman said. “We must prioritize our citizens over those who are here unlawfully. While Wisconsin currently does not allow undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare, this bill preemptively… ensures that Wisconsin does not become like Minnesota or Illinois.”
Dallman noted that the bill includes a carve out to ensure that it won’t lose Wisconsin money or put it out of step with federal law.
According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau summary, the prohibitions in the bill would not apply to the extent that a payment is required under federal law or the application of the prohibitions would result in the loss of any federal funds.
“This bill is not about immigration,” Dallman said, but it is about “protecting our constituents and their hard-earned tax dollars that they send into our state.”
In written testimony, Wanggaard said the bill would extend the current restrictions to “all other health services paid for by the State of Wisconsin.” Wanggaard, who did not attend the public hearing, wrote that the bill would ensure Wisconsin “is not the next test dummy extending health benefits to illegal aliens.”
Democrats and advocates said they are concerned about the sweeping effects the bill could have on all Wisconsinites. 
William Parke-Sutherland, government affairs director at Kids Forward, said the bill would be unworkable as law and would affect every health care provider in the state.
“This bill is entirely short sighted, and nobody has thought about how this would create a state in which we do not want to live,” Parke-Sutherland said. “If a child is at the school and is sick, does the school nurse need to figure out how to verify their status before they provide any degree of care?… I just don’t think that people have thought through the consequences of us in Wisconsin having to live in a situation where we all need to carry our papers.” 
Parke-Sutherland noted that there are already strict citizenship requirements people need to meet to enroll in nearly all Medicaid programs.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) outlines the restrictions on its website as well as  two programs available to noncitizens. One is Medicaid Emergency Services, which provides short-term medical coverage for people who have a medical emergency and aren’t eligible for BadgerCare Plus or Wisconsin Medicaid, and the other is BadgerCare Plus Prenatal Plan, which provides health care coverage for pregnant mothers who are not eligible for BadgerCare Plus due to immigration status or being in prison or jail.
“This is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist, and it’s creating way, way, way more problems,” Parke-Sutherland said. “If you are creating a situation where you’re prohibiting funding for services for people who are unlawfully present, then you are creating a need for people to verify their status in order to receive health care.” 
In a fiscal analysis, the Department of Corrections said it is concerned the bill could violate the 8th Amendment. A 1976 Supreme Court decision in Estelle v. Gamble established that the deliberate failure to deal with an inmate’s medical needs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. 
Wanggaard refuted the analysis in written testimony, saying the bill language means it would only apply to state programs that require enrollment. 
“It does not mean that, for example, an illegal immigrant in the state prison system could not receive health care services from DOC,” Wanggaard said. 
The language of the bill, however, says that “no funds of this state or of any county, village, town, or long-term care district… and no federal funds passing through the state treasury shall be authorized for or paid to any person to subsidize, reimburse, or otherwise provide compensation for any health care services for an individual who is not lawfully present in the United States.”
Rep. Karen Kirsch (D-Greenfield) said her Republican colleagues are taking a page from President Donald Trump and his administration by downplaying the effect of the bill. 
“They’re watching how Trump handles things,” Kirsch said. “They’re pushing the envelope on every interpretation of every word and every piece of legislation to go target people, to go after people… They’re watching how he handles things, and I think that they’re mimicking that at the state. They’re trying to make it sound like, ‘Well, this is all so reasonable. This is not a big deal. Don’t worry about it.’ And then if it passes, then we’re going to see it’s way… way worse.”
Kirsch said she is concerned about the potential “chilling effect” that the bill could have, discouraging individuals and families from seeking care when they need it. 
“[Republicans are] trying to raise this to the public consciousness, and then people are going to be confused,” Kirsch said. “‘Is this a way that they’re going to find me, if I’m an undocumented person?… Even if I do qualify for care, maybe something’s going to happen to me?’ It can have this overall chilling effect of confusion of whether or not people feel safe enough to get care.”
Kirsch took issue with the argument that the bill would protect taxpayers’ money. 
“When they do have access to health care, that also keeps our health care prices down because they’re not showing up in our emergency rooms, they’re doing preventative care, they’re taking care of their diabetes, and they’re not showing up with some serious diabetes complication in our emergency room,” Kirsch said. 
Kirsch also noted that undocumented immigrants pay sales tax and contribute to the state’s economy. She referenced a 2024 report from the University of Wisconsin School for Workers that found that undocumented immigrants specifically contributed $240 million in state and local taxes in 2022.
According to the Wisconsin Lobbying website, the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, Inc., Kids Forward, the Wisconsin chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, the Wisconsin Association of School Nurses and the Wisconsin Council of Churches are registered against the bill. The only group registered in favor is FGA Action, a Florida-based nonprofit that advocates for conservative policies in statehouses around the country.
David Gwidt, Deputy Communications Director for the ACLU of Wisconsin, said in a statement to the Examiner that the legislation if enacted “could result in absurd circumstances for medical and mental health providers across the state and exacerbate this fear and uncertainty experienced by our immigrant neighbors.” 
The Assembly State Affairs Committee plans to vote on whether to advance the legislation Tuesday, setting it up for a floor vote later this week.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Another trial in the killing of 17-year-old Alvin Cole by then-Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensah began Monday, with attorneys battling over whether Mensah used excessive force when he killed Cole following a foot chase in 2020. U.S. District Court Judge Lynn Adelman is presiding over the case, as he did when the case went to trial earlier this year, ending in a hung jury. Mensah has claimed that Cole pointed a gun in his direction, making him fear for his life and triggering his decision to fire five shots at Cole.  
An all-white, eight-member jury was selected out of a pool of 36 potential jurors, with an even split of men and women. None of the jurors are from Milwaukee. Two indicated that they have close relatives who served in law enforcement, though they said this would not sway their decision-making. 
Attorney Kimberley Motley, representing Cole and his family, used a projection screen to display a photo of Cole when he was younger. She told jurors that sometimes kids do stupid things, which in this case was running from the police, but also that running alone does not give grounds for officers to use deadly force. “Some kids ran faster, some kids ran slower, and Alvin was one of the slower kids,” Motley said. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Motley noted that Mensah was not the first officer on the scene. Yet he was the only officer to fire. She stressed to the jury that Mensah, not Cole, “is the only one on trial,” and that jurors can acknowledge that police have a hard job while also finding that Mensah used excessive force. 
Cole was Mensah’s third shooting over a five-year period at Wauwatosa PD, a fact not shared with jurors. In his opening statement, attorney Joseph Wirth told jurors that foot chases are incredibly dangerous and unpredictable and that Cole made “catastrophically bad” decisions and “the escalation of danger” was “enormous”. After firing a gun he was carrying, Wirth said Cole went into a crouch-like position, fired at Olson, and then turned towards Mensah before he was killed. One of the key issues in the case has been conflicting statements from police officers on the scene, with Mensah saying the gun was only pointed at him, Officer David Shamsi (who was closest to Cole), saying the gun hadn’t moved at all, and Officer Even Olson saying that the gun was pointed towards him and away from Mensah. 
“Sympathy for loss of life can exist at the same time as your duty as a juror to uphold the law,” Wirth told the jurors. He asked them to “clear your minds of sympathy” and reiterated that “Alvin Cole made catastrophically bad decisions.”
Both civilian and law enforcement witnesses were called to the stand Monday, beginning with UW-Milwaukee film and documentary teacher Sean Kafer, who’d reviewed squad and deposition videos for the trial. Kafer testified that he added a red circle to a version of the squad video depicting the shooting, and removed background noise. The video was played multiple times for jurors. Wirth also played versions of the squad video. The low quality of the video was one of the issues noted by the jurors who failed to reach a unanimous decision in the last trial. 
Shamsi, now an FBI agent and a major in the U.S. Army Reserve with combat experience, was working overtime the night of the shooting. He was among the officers who “floated” to the area in case they were needed. 
After the first shot went off, Shamsi testified that Cole ended up on his hands and knees, with the firearm still in his right hand. Mensah came from behind Shamsi, who said that he did not see Cole turn or take a shooter’s stance as Wirth said in opening statements.
Video from Shamsi’s squad car was also played capturing him talking to other officers, including investigators from the Milwaukee Police Department who’d come to take his statement. In those videos, Shamsi can be heard saying “he was crawling” and that Shamsi was right next to “dude” when the shooting happened. When asked about Cole aiming the gun, Shamsi said, “I did not see it move.” Shamsi cautioned, though, that the situation was chaotic and rapid, and that he may not have noticed everything. He added that it was a deadly situation, and that he was prepared to fire if needed. 
Shenora Statten-Jordan, a principal at Messmer High School testified that she was leaving a Mayfair-area restaurant when the shooting happened. Driving her white SUV beside her husband and two children in the back, Statten-Jordan testified to seeing lights and commotion near the Cheesecake Factory parking lot. As her vehicle approached she could see other officers responding, hear the shots, and see a boy fall to the ground onto his stomach with his legs still kicking “as if he was still running.” 
Wirth attempted to establish, as he’d done in the last trial, that Statten-Jordan was not in a position to actually see the shooting. Video from Shamsi’s dash camera and a passing Milwaukee County bus, however, showed that Statten-Jordan was where she’d testified she was. After witnessing the shooting, she was interviewed by the Greenfield Police Department as part of the shooting investigation. Statten-Jordan said she’d offered to go back to the scene with officers, but that they didn’t take her up on the offer.
The last witness of the day was Wauwatosa officer Jeffrey Johnson, who left his own patrol sector to respond to the mall that day. Johnson recalled meeting Shamsi, chasing the teens and hearing the shots that ended Cole’s life. Johnson testified that Cole had fallen to his hands and knees, and that from his position 20-25 yards away that he, like Shamsi, did not see Cole move. Nor did Johnson fire his weapon, although he drew it after the first shot was fired. Johnson said that although he didn’t see Cole move while on the ground, a lot was going on. Johnson said that officer training does not require a gun to be pointed at you to justify firing. 
The trial is expected to last until late Wednesday or early Thursday, when the case will be turned over for deliberations. Dr. Weislaw Tlomak, Chief Medical Officer of the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, is expected to begin testimony Tuesday.

New study shows deer avoid cheatgrass-covered areas, but authors also provide hope.
The post Mule deer could lose half their northeast Wyoming habitat to cheatgrass without help appeared first on WyoFile .","When thin shoots of cheatgrass are the first plants to green up in the spring, mule deer might nibble the tops like any of us might idly crunch last week’s pretzels still sitting on our office desks. 
Come early summer, though, that same cheatgrass turns into brown, leggy strands. At that point, mule deer want to eat it as much as we want to consume the cardboard box containing those stale pretzels. They just won’t do it. 
In fact, they dislike cheatgrass so much that mule deer will avoid an area completely once it contains about 20% of the annual invasive grass, according to a study published in early September in the journal Rangeland Ecology and Management. 
The study’s authors, all from the University of Wyoming, compared movement patterns from 115 GPS-collared mule deer with range maps showing variation in plant cover. They found that when cheatgrass covers less than 10% of an area, deer will still browse. When it covers 10-16%, they will begin to avoid an area. Anything above 20% is utterly unappealing.

Even more alarmingly, the study shows that as cheatgrass continues to spread in northeast Wyoming over the next couple decades, up to 50% of current good habitat could be rendered useless to mule deer. 
The spread of cheatgrass likely won’t be the final nail in mule deer’s coffin, but it will be one of many contributing to their continued decline. Unlike many studies that focus exclusively on declines, however, this one carries a rather large kernel of hope. When treating cheatgrass with herbicides in a targeted and strategic way, land managers can start to win the fight and mule deer will also return. 
A perpetual plague
Cheatgrass has been the scourge of western landscapes for well over a century, when it first arrived from Europe and Asia nestled in bags of seed and bales of straw. Like most nonnative, invasive grasses, it didn’t evolve here and quickly found a way to outcompete its native neighbors. It “cheats,” germinating over winter to be the first grass to grow in the spring, using water and resources before native grasses, plants and shrubs are awake enough from their winter slumber to start looking for nourishment again. 
But by early summer, cheatgrass cures, losing any trace amounts of nutritional value. It becomes a fire hazard, another part of its evolutionary strategy. As fires whip across a landscape, aided by dry cheatgrass, the blazes kill native competitors, giving cheatgrass even more opportunities to spread. 
It’s a problem that has plagued ranchers, wildlife biologists and land managers for decades, but until recently, few publications had explicitly shown at what threshold mule deer will simply avoid cheatgrass-covered areas.

UW professors Jerod Merkle and Brian Mealor along with research scientist Kurt Smith used data showing how mule deer acted in much of the northeast corner of the state, provided by Western EcoSystems Technology biologist Hall Sawyer. The researchers could see deer collar points move into and out of areas with good food and habitat and avoid those areas with increasing amounts of cheatgrass. 
Jill Randall, Wyoming Game and Fish Department big game migration coordinator, who was not involved in the study, said the results make sense. 
“Deer are super selective foragers, and if they can choose between native and non-native, they will go where there’s something better,” she said. “If cheatgrass is scattered in and among things, they will nibble, but 20% or above is pretty dominant. If they can go elsewhere and eat other native species, they will.”
The problem then becomes when deer start to run out of other places to go. 
Hope for conservation
Losing half their potential habitat in the next 20 years sounds dramatic. And it is, especially for a herd already suffering from energy development, highways, fences and drought.
But solutions exist, the authors say, particularly in an herbicide called Rejuvra, which was approved by the EPA in 2020 and is being used on rangelands across the West. 
The herbicide works by killing annual seeds and leaving perennial grasses and plants relatively untouched. It’s expensive, Randall said, and requires repeated treatments. But she and many other experts say it’s critical for maintaining sagebrush ecosystems upon which countless mule deer, sagegrouse, songbirds and even lizards depend.

A study published in August used camera traps to show that mule deer will return to areas with native plants after cheatgrass removal. 
That’s also what Smith, Merkle and Mealor’s models showed. In fact, mule deer will return in abundance following treatment of cheatgrass-covered acres, potentially reversing much of that 50% of habitat that was otherwise lost. 
The authors say the paper isn’t meant to cause alarm but to explain the direness of the situation and hopefulness of potential solutions. 
Gov. Mark Gordon and state lawmakers agree, and earlier this year, provided tens of millions of dollars in grants and loans to fight invasive grasses. 
Bottom line, Smith said: “If we do nothing, we’re in trouble. But there is hope.”

Legislators need to hear from workers who can’t set down roots in communities where it’s hard to find a place to live, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Wyoming’s investment in affordable housing is worth the fight appeared first on WyoFile .","Here’s a fundamental question Wyoming lawmakers keep ignoring at the state’s peril: What kind of a future do we have when workers can’t find anywhere they can afford to live?

Opinion

I know it pales in comparison to subjects the Legislature spends so much time on, like determining what bathrooms people can use, banning library books that mention sex and erecting more barriers to voting.
But the affordable housing crisis is destined to get worse if lawmakers don’t find the political will to act now. Combined with two other major Wyoming problems — lack of affordable health care and our state’s frustrating inability to provide adequate and constitutionally mandated school funding for all students — it’s taking a huge toll on our economy and well-being.
The Legislature has had ample opportunities to address these issues, but has noticeably devoted the least attention to housing.
A grassroots group wants legislators to focus on Wyoming’s affordable housing crisis and do something that’s been effective in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico. 
Only Wyoming and Mississippi haven’t created a state housing trust fund.
The Wyoming Housing Investment Alliance is gathering signatures on a letter of support to send to the Legislature so it will consider a housing bill that the extremist Freedom Caucus didn’t even deem worthy of an introduction vote during this year’s general session. 
The Legislature needs to be forcefully pushed in that direction. A Wyoming Community Development Association report last year found there’s not a single county in Wyoming where a family earning their county’s median income can afford a typical home in their community.
That should be a shocking statistic, but Wyomingites understand it all too well. The lack of good-paying jobs in most sectors other than the minerals industry has long pushed young people to leave the state to find employment.


But now those who have jobs and want to stay — including such bedrock occupations like teachers, nurses and government workers — pack their bags and flee to proverbial greener pastures because they can’t find an affordable place to live.
One factor is an influx of older people moving here from out of state who can afford to spend more on housing. Long-time residents find limited and more expensive housing stock if they want to upgrade, so they stay where they are, leaving fewer “starter homes” on the market for young families.
There are also few financial incentives for developers to construct less expensive housing with much lower profit margins.
“Lack of affordable housing is stifling our economy and making it hard for working-class families to establish roots,” Rep. Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, told me in an interview earlier this year. “If we want our young people to stay and grow the economy, the state must invest in housing.”
A bill that would have put $15 million into a state housing trust fund in 2023 never made it out of committee. 
This year, Sherwood sponsored her own measure to create a $20 million housing investment fund that has the potential to make a significant impact on affordable housing problems statewide. It’s the bill the new Wyoming Housing Investment Alliance wants to resurrect, because the Freedom Caucus that controls the House’s agenda had neither the good sense nor courage to let it be debated.
Sherwood’s bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Evie Brennan, R-Cheyenne, would allow Wyoming nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity and the Wyoming Housing Network to be eligible to receive half of the funds through grants and zero-interest loans for new construction, repairs and rehabilitation, transitional housing, first-time homebuyer assistance, and rental voucher programs.
For-profit businesses could apply for up to 45% of the funds available through a low-interest revolving loan fund for new construction, repairs and rehabilitation.
These components are what the National Low Income Housing Coalition stressed in a June report examining the 843 housing trust funds established across the country. They target a wide range of housing problems in rural and urban areas, from helping young people buy their first home to assisting the most marginalized renters who need safe, decent, affordable and accessible housing.
The details can be tweaked, which should appeal to lawmakers who insist that whatever the problem is, it requires a “Wyoming solution.” That old chestnut has probably killed bills clear back to the first days of statehood in 1890, because it’s something lawmakers love to say but rarely know how to accomplish.
But it needn’t be the death knell for the housing issue. 
Trust funds have been effective pretty much everywhere they’ve been tried in states, cities and counties. Many states have used trust fund legislation to empower local governments to set up their own trusts to tailor affordable housing development to unique community needs. Enacted here, it would create a set of de facto “Wyoming solutions.”
Lawmakers who don’t want to create a huge bureaucracy to deal with affordable housing should be encouraged by the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s report. More than half of housing trust funds are managed by one to three staff members, and about one-third had an annual administrative budget of less than $50,000.
Sherwood and Brennan told the Sheridan Press that while Wyoming’s leaders like to talk about economic development and diversifying the economy, the bottom line is the state needs a workforce.
“In order to have that workforce, we have to have affordable housing,” Brennan said. “We cannot keep our children here or attract new families if we don’t have the infrastructure. Affordable housing is part of that infrastructure needed for our communities and state to thrive.”
The pair has an even steeper hill to climb at next year’s budget session. This year’s bill only needed a simple majority to be considered, but in 2026, it will take a two-thirds supermajority to be introduced.
I’m glad to see the public lobbying for the state to make a strong commitment to invest in housing. Lawmakers need to hear directly from people whose lives have been upended by their inability to find an affordable place to buy or rent.
Whenever you hear legislators try to steer the conversation to some hot-button cultural issue, disarm them with a real-world problem about housing. You’ll be fighting for Wyoming’s future.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun) The night his daughter died, Allen Hodges said he didn’t know the law.
After Kylie, 16, was taking a while in the bath, he went in to check on her and found her unresponsive on Dec. 19, 2020.
He called 911 and started CPR. But he soon realized she’d had a tonic seizure, a more severe type that had been flaring up for Kylie, who had epilepsy.
Paramedics arrived. They tried to save her, then asked if they should keep going. Hodges said they shouldn’t.
Then a local sheriff’s deputy escorted him out of his house in Caldwell, which was apparently being treated as a crime scene even though he had told first responders about his daughter’s history with epilepsy. 
After Kylie was declared dead, Hodges dressed her and carried her to a funeral home car, he recalled recently. 
“I didn’t even have a chance to grieve that night,” Hodges said in an interview, sitting in his office next to a photo of his daughter, and a flower she drew on his whiteboard in his office.
Worried that nude photos of his dead daughter could be released publicly after a watchdog report found corner records aren’t confidential, Hodges pushed for a bill in the Legislature this year to clarify privacy protections for death investigation records. The bill, introduced late in the legislative session, stalled and didn’t pass. 
But Sen. Melissa Wintrow, the Democratic state lawmaker from Boise who led that bill and a separate successful coroner reform law, said she plans to bring the privacy bill again next year. She’s working with local coroners on more fixes, like she did last year. 
Years after Kylie died, Hodges said he’s fighting for his daughter’s dignity and other parents’ rights as he pursues reforms to Idaho’s troubled coroner system — in court and through the Legislature. He shared accounts of his daughter’s death investigation in interviews with the Idaho Capital Sun and in lawsuits he recently filed against Canyon County officials.

 Officials won’t share, or delete photos, Canyon County prosecutor says

In the lawsuits, in which he’s representing himself, Hodges has asked courts to require local officials to destroy and give back what he claims are unwarranted, nude photos of his dead daughter, and compensate him for what he alleges are civil rights violations.
“People need to be aware that the process is not on a level playing field from county to county. And the state legislators need to fix the broken system,” he said. 
Canyon County officials say an investigation into his daughter’s death — when no doctor was present — was warranted. And they say officials won’t release photos from the death investigation, but they won’t destroy them. 
“The records with which Mr. Hodges is concerned are protected and will not be disclosed publicly,” Canyon County Prosecuting Attorney Christopher Boyd told the Sun in a letter in July. “… Unless authorized by law, reports related to unattended deaths are generally never destroyed and remain the property of the County’s investigatory law enforcement agencies. Thus, any requests to destroy investigatory records absent legal authority will be denied and those records preserved.”
A watchdog report that spurred the recent push to reform Idaho’s coroner system found that state law “does not prevent a coroner from sharing information” gathered in a death investigation. And it recommended lawmakers take up the issue to “lessen the chance of impeding a criminal investigation” and respect families’ privacy.
Kylie’s death was ruled natural, according to her death certificate.
 As lawmakers worked to revamp Idaho’s coroner system, Hodges shared the story of his daughter’s death

In Idaho, coroners are an elected, county-level position, as outlined in the state’s constitution.
This spring — after a critical watchdog report in 2024 by the Office of Performance Evaluations found inconsistencies in death investigations across Idaho, driven by sparse guidance in state law — the Idaho Legislature widely passed into law a bill to clarify the roles of coroners and law enforcement in death investigations. 
Gov. Little signs bill that will reform the roles Idaho coroners have in death investigations

Debating in the Idaho Senate, Wintrow called the bill a first step that was “a long time coming.” She referenced decades of failed attempts to reform Idaho’s coroner system, which a ProPublica investigation last year detailed. 
In February, when that bill was in its early stages, Hodges testified before a legislative committee about his daughter’s death — and the need for privacy protections for coroner records.
“After I did all the CPR (and) informed him of her epilepsy, the deputy coroner on the scene and the (detective) seized her medicine. They told me, ‘You didn’t do anything wrong, but that deputy is going to escort you outside of your house, and this has turned into a crime scene,’” Hodges, who serves as president of the Idaho Trucking Association but was appearing as a parent, told lawmakers.
“They took nude photos of my daughter,” he told the committee. “I have no control over those photographs at all — because there’s no law in Idaho.”
A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2004 allows autopsy images to be withheld from public release. The watchdog report found information coroners gather in death investigations “is not considered confidential.” 
The report, by the Office of Performance Evaluations, recommended the Legislature consider updating state law “to include regulations on confidentiality of information gathered by coroners in a death investigation”
Without a clear understanding about confidentiality requirements, “each coroner just kind of does their own thing,” Office of Performance Evaluations Director Ryan Langrill told the Sun.
“My read of the law is that there are no exemptions whatsoever, except for records that are protected through some secondary law,” such as privacy protections for personnel or police records, he said. 
Last month, as law enforcement released troves of information from the investigation into a quadruple murder in Moscow, KTVB published blurred photos from the crime scene, which the outlet received through a public records request from local police. The Boise-based TV station was the only Idaho news outlet to publish the photos, and families were not notified before they were released, the Spokesman-Review reported.
KTVB could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Idaho State Association of County Coroners President Torey Danner said Idaho doesn’t have many public record protections for coroner records. But he said he thinks that should change.

“Unfortunately, there just are certain things that I don’t believe need to be made public. One family’s tragedy should not be another family’s entertainment,” said Danner, who is also Bannock County’s coroner. 
Late in the legislative session this year, Wintrow introduced another bill, Senate Bill 1135, that aimed to address Hodges’ privacy concerns. But she soon pulled the bill from consideration this year, realizing it went too far in concealing coroner records after an investigative journalist from ProPublica contacted her for a story on the bill.
In late 2024, ProPublica’s reporting highlighted gaps in Idaho’s coroner system. Then in March, the investigative news outlet reported that the privacy protection bill could “shield from public view records that ProPublica relied on in its coverage.”
“When you’re drafting a bill right in legislative session, when you’re being pulled in 1,000 directions, you could try to write something, and that’s what we did,” said Wintrow, a Boise Democrat who co-chairs the state’s Legislative Oversight Committee that ordered the state’s watchdog report on the coroner system.
But she soon realized it would make more records private than she wanted. “So that’s why I put the brakes on and said, ‘No, we don’t do bad legislation,’” Wintrow said.
She said she thinks the solution would be to treat coroner records like law enforcement records under the state’s Public Record Act, so journalists could still access some coroner records, but not all. 
Hodges says he worries everyday about pictures of his daughter ending up online. 
“Is that fair to a parent?” he told the Sun. 
 Online coroner training had nude photos of dead bodies. It’s no longer publicly available.

In April, before Hodges asked Canyon County to delete photos of his daughter, he found photos of nude and partially dressed dead people published online in a training for Idaho coroners on the Idaho Association of Counties’ website. The training on death investigation photography — which is no longer publicly available — credited Ada County for the presentation. 
In May, when the Idaho Capital Sun contacted Ada County Coroner Rich Riffle about the photos, he said in an email he would address it immediately and that he didn’t review the presentation beforehand. The presentation was intended to be used professionally, not by the public, he said.
The Association of Counties made the training only available to coroners, the association’s policy adviser Kelli Brassfield told the Sun in an email.
Ada County doesn’t seek permission from families to use materials in presentations or use active cases, Riffle, the coroner, said. 
“The great care taken is in the redaction of the photographs – to include such things as any family photos on a wall in the background,” he said. “… Even with this due diligence in redactions, our presenters make it clear up front that the attendees will see pictures that may be disturbing, and that they are local cases so there may be a chance someone will recognize the case even with all the details of any potential identifying images carefully redacted.”
The images in the training, reviewed by the Sun, showed two unredacted nude bodies. A female whose breasts were exposed had a block box over her eyes. Photos of a male, fully undressed on a gurney, did not appear to have redactions.
In May, Hodges asked Canyon County officials to delete photos of his daughter.
Boyd, the local prosecutor, told Hodges that when he talked to Canyon County Coroner Jennifer Crawford, she told him “her process would never be to release photos of any investigation under the Public Records Act.”
Christopher Boyd, serving as a special prosecutor for the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, argues in court in this file photo in February 2024. (Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
“In my discussion with the Coroner, she has assured me that she has not disclosed anything of a sensitive nature including photos which is not required by law,” Boyd wrote to Hodges, according to a copy of the letter the Sun obtained through a public records request. “I understand you have requested to have the photos of the autopsy provided to you and for the Coroner to not keep any of those images. I will reach out to her and forward your request.”
“Again, I am sorry for your loss and hope that the legislative changes you are requesting are ultimately adopted,” Boyd wrote at the end of the letter.
In June, Hodges filed a tort claim with the county, which is precursor to a lawsuit. Then he filed lawsuits against Canyon County law enforcement and coroner officials in state and federal courts. He is legally representing himself in the lawsuits.
 Working with coroners and law enforcement, Idaho lawmakers are working toward more coroner legislation. But funding is a barrier.

Idaho’s new law clarifying death investigation roles only addressed some of the litany of recommendations in the watchdog report. 
The report, nearly 100 pages, also found:

Idaho had the lowest autopsy rate in the nation for deaths of children and homicides, and the third lowest rate for death autopsies overall.
It’s unclear if coroners are even fulfilling the 24-hours of training required every two years.
State expenses for coroner offices was “a minor fraction of overall county budgets,” and many coroner offices’ ability to operate is hampered by lacking “essential resources and equipment.”

In the months after the legislative session ended in spring, Wintrow and other state lawmakers have been meeting with coroners and law enforcement as part of a work group to craft future legislation. One proposal the group has considered could require autopsies for children, Boise State Public Radio reported.
But to Wintrow, the biggest hurdle in addressing more of the watchdog report’s findings is figuring out how to fund coroner offices better. That’s where the Legislature can step in, especially to help smaller counties, Wintrow said. 
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, asks a question during a Senate Health and Welfare Committee hearing on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
But she wishes the Legislature wouldn’t have cut the state’s revenue so much this year, when lawmakers approved $400 million in tax cuts and $50 million in tax credits for parents who send their kids to private schools. 
“That has put us in a pickle,” Wintrow said in July.
Last month, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state government agencies besides public schools to cut their budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall. But the budget shortfall estimate didn’t account for tax cuts in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement, the Sun reported. 
In response to a follow-up survey this year by the state watchdog agency, the Office of Performance Evaluations, some coroners said “the lack of dedicated funding prevents them from obtaining necessary equipment, securing full-time staff, and increasing autopsy capacity.”

“The coroner system in Idaho is broken and a joke,” one unnamed coroner replied to the survey. 
That was part of a trend of local coroners wanting the state to step in, ProPublica recently reported. 
 Lawsuit claims death investigation wasn’t warranted. Canyon County Prosecutor disputes that.

In his lawsuit in state court, Hodges asked the court to order government agencies to destroy any nude or graphic photos of his dead daughter and return the original photos to family, alleging that the photos were obtained without legal justification. 
In his federal lawsuit, he alleges a slew of civil rights violations — many of which revolve around his claim that the county’s investigation into his daughter’s death was not legally justified.
In his state court lawsuit, Hodges cites two Idaho laws as recognizing “that not all deaths require a law enforcement response, particularly when there is no indication of foul play and the medical circumstances are understood.”
“In the case of my daughter, who had a known medical disease and had recently been seen by her physician, these protections were disregarded,” Hodges argues in his legal complaint. “Despite her established medical condition and the presence of a treating physician who could have certified her death, no effort was made to contact her doctor. Instead, the authorities proceeded with a criminal investigation, treating the scene as suspicious without medical justification.”
Citing a report from paramedics, Hodges told the Sun paramedics talked with a doctor about Kylie’s care while they were trying to resuscitate her. In his lawsuit, he claims coroner staff failed to apply an exemption in Idaho law that he claims doesn’t require investigations into children’s deaths if they have a known medical condition.
Asked about Hodges’ lawsuits, Canyon County spokesperson Aaron Williams denied wrongdoing or disclosing any confidential information, but declined to comment more on the issues raised in the lawsuits. 
“Canyon County follows any and all current laws regarding public record requests,” he said.
Boyd previously has said a law enforcement investigation into Hodges’ daughter’s death was warranted.
In his May letter to Hodges, Boyd cited an Idaho law that requires coroners refer death investigations to local law enforcement “if a death occurs that is not attended by a physician and the cause of death cannot be certified by a physician.”
“In this matter, EMT’s were called to the scene to assist in attempts at resuscitation,” Boyd wrote. “Under the law, the presence of EMTs does not equate to a death occurring in the presence of a physician and therefore an investigation was warranted.”
Looking back on the night his daughter died, Hodges said he has one regret.
“It may sound incorrect, but because after what I went through, I wish I’d never called for help,” he said. “If I couldn’t have saved her on my own, we could’ve just buried her on the property and had the pastor come over and had a ceremony.”
He doesn’t want other parents to go through what he did.
“Being investigated as a suspect or whatever — that, that sticks with you,” he said.

(Photo: Rob Colvin)The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency is potentially a few months away from purchasing about 7,500 acres of land along the Hatchie River for conservation and outdoor recreation.
The property spans Haywood, Hardeman and Madison counties in West Tennessee and includes ecologically valuable wetlands marked as a priority for conservation.
“This acquisition will secure the protection of sensitive wetlands and unique wildlife habitat while adding a large amount of huntable land, according to information presented to the State Building Commissions’ executive subcommittee.
While this property is a longstanding area of interest for wildlife conservation and outdoor recreation plans from years past, its acquisition would also secure protection of key wetlands following the April passage of a bill that rolled back regulations for about 80% of the Tennessee wetlands no longer shielded by federal law. It’s not clear if this property includes wetlands that would otherwise be at risk. 
While many tributaries of the Mississippi River have been altered to flow in a straighter “channel,” the Hatchie River is the longest free-flowing tributary of the Lower Mississippi and has the largest remaining floodplain in the state, according to TWRA Public Relations Director Emily Buck.
The pending purchase would add to more than 30,000 acres of protected state and federal public lands along the scenic Hatchie River, the only river in West Tennessee that was not channelized — engineered to be straighter, deeper or wider — in the mid-1900s. Instead, the Hatchie follows its natural meandering course, providing multiple types of habitat for the more than 100 species of fish and 35 mussel species that call the river home. 
The Hatchie River’s forests also support more than 250 species of birds, white-tailed deer, river otters, beavers, and the Eastern box turtle, among others.
TWRA plans to purchase the land from Hatchie River Hardwoods LLC, with help from two nonprofits: The Conservation Fund and The Nature Conservancy. The Conservation Fund will get the property under contract, and TWRA will ultimately acquire and manage the land, according to government documents.
The plot will become a new Wildlife Management Area, a space that conserves wildlife habitat while providing public access opportunities. It will be one of the largest bottomland hardwood forests (think river swamps) with a single owner in Tennessee.
TWRA will pay $450,000 toward the undisclosed “fair market value” price, with the Tennessee Heritage Conservation Fund covering the bulk of the cost, Buck said in a statement to Tennessee Lookout. The Wetlands Acquisition Fund will also be used. The land last sold in 2021 for around $27.5 million, state records show.
The Tennessee commissioner of agriculture and TWRA executive director have already approved the tract for purchase, and the State Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee also granted its approval in late August.
Buck surmises that TWRA will close on the property in November.

(Getty Images)Over the past 30 years, I’ve worked in nearly every corner of Idaho’s education system — teaching in classrooms, leading Catholic and public schools, and serving as a superintendent through times of growth, hardship and everything in between. Schools anchor our communities, especially in places like Kimberly where our school district is the city’s largest employer.
Right now, I’m more worried than ever about what’s ahead.
Earlier this year, the Legislature passed a law, despite record-breaking calls urging the governor to veto it, that uses $50 million in taxpayer dollars to subsidize private school tuition with little to no accountability for how those funds are used.
There’s a projected state budget deficit of $79 million. Gov. Brad Little has ordered state agencies to cut 3% from budgets to address the shortfall. While public schools, which serve 94% of Idaho’s students, have their operations budgets frozen for the fiscal year, that $50 million “Parental Choice Tax Credit” money remains untouched. 
Idaho’s projected budget deficit does not include impact of ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’

Let’s look at the big picture. Schools are already operating at a fraction of what budgets were before the recession. We made sacrifices during hard times with the promise things would bounce back. That was 15 years ago. Last session, legislators defeated a bill that would provide $3 million for high-needs special education students. Schools lost dedicated funds from the Idaho Lottery.
 In their place we were given a new “facilities bill” that sounded like an increase in funding, but is just a pass through for property taxes. While that’s a relief for property owners, it doesn’t pay for repairs, maintain schools, support growing enrollment or cover rising costs.
When lawmakers say we need to trim the fat in education, I challenge you to show me where it is. Instead of solving the problem by tapping into Idaho’s maxed-out rainy day fund, they’re stripping away more.
Communities like mine will be forced to ask taxpayers to pick up the difference, or schools may be pushed into financial crisis. Families who were promised more choices will see new bonds and levies on their ballots. That’s not choice.
Here’s the truth: We already have school choice in Idaho. Families can choose public schools, charter schools, private schools, homeschooling or online learning. That’s something to celebrate. But private schools are private for a reason.
When I was a Catholic school principal, we existed for the Catholic identity. We accepted students regardless of faith, we had an accredited curriculum and a strong staff of certified teachers. With my Catholic school hat on, I would have been looking at this law saying “the government shouldn’t be telling me what to teach.”
I also worry this new law will water down Idaho’s quality private schools while stripping funds from our public and charter schools. Why? If families have $5,000 a year per child for private tuition, we’ll likely see what happened in Arizona. Pop-up “private schools” emerged without accreditation, teachers without diplomas, background checks and no curriculum. That hurts everyone.
That’s not what taxpayer dollars were meant to fund.
Idaho’s public schools are already running lean. In districts like mine, we’ve cut, consolidated and squeezed every dollar. If these cuts go through, we’ll be talking about eliminating programs, reducing salaries and real threats to keeping our schools open — especially in rural areas.
This isn’t just an education issue. It’s an economic one. Our schools are often the largest employers in town. When they suffer, the whole community suffers.
We can’t allow a small group of political operatives to dismantle a system that, as required by our state constitution, serves everyone. We must preserve public education.
I urge every Idahoan to learn what’s really happening and to stand up for your local schools. Whether or not you have kids in the classroom, your tax dollars are on the line.
It’s time to say enough. Not one more public dollar for private tuition.

But messaging for health care providers this year is tricky.
“It is tumultuous. There’s a lot of chaos,” Dr. David Wohl told NC Newsline in a recent interview.
Wohl is a professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He has spent over 20 years leading research into the prevention and treatment of HIV. In 2020, he helped lead the UNC clinical and research response to COVID-19.
The tumult that Wohl is referring to now is the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his stance on vaccines.
In a fiery hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Kennedy justified his firing of an influential vaccine advisory panel, while saying it was unclear the COVID-19 vaccine had saved millions of lives. The 71-year-old Kennedy has expressed distrust in the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
‘Throwing shade’
Wohl calls the recent politicization of vaccines “tragic.”
Infectious diseases professor Dr. David Wohl (Screengrab from Newsline interview)
Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including North Carolina’s Mandy Cohen, wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed that Kennedy in his short tenure had “severely weakened programs designed to protect Americans” by canceling promising medical research and downplaying vaccines.
“Most people in this country understand that vaccines work,” Wohl said. “Especially older people who remember what it was like, you know, when there were such things as polio, you know, and whooping cough, you know, running through schools. So again, I think that most people get it, but our leadership is really, unfortunately, on the fringe. And this is a very, very dangerous course that we’re leading to.”
Wohl and others point to measles, once believed to be eliminated in the United States. Vaccine confusion and vaccine hesitancy has allowed the virus to reemerge.
“This is a vaccine that has been around for literally generations. We know all about it. We know about its safety. We know about its effectiveness. You know, two shots render you like 98% impervious to getting measles. It’s a triumph,” explained Wohl. “The epicenter of these outbreaks are in communities that have decided not to vaccinate their children. And we are seeing somebody come in from another place where measles is endemic and infecting people and then it spreads like wildfire.”
More than 1,400 confirmed cases have been reported in 41 states this year.
He notes that the good news is most of Americans are immune. If you were born before 1957, chances are you contracted measles and developed lifelong immunity. When the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, it became widely recommended for children and adults and by the ’70s was combined to what we now commonly call the MMR vaccine, covering measles, mumps and rubella.
“So, a lot of us are already immune but if it gets a niche into a place, a community where there’s less vaccination, then you start to see it spread. So, I think it’s a matter of time before we get some cases in North Carolina,” said the UNC Health infectious disease researcher.
But Wohl worries about Kennedy “throwing shade on vaccines” leading to only more confusion.
Senators and some states push back
In the Sept. 4 committee hearing, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis said Kennedy’s statements were so contradictory, he wanted them submitted in writing to clarify his positions.

“You [said you] will do nothing that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. There seem to be several reports that would seem to refute that,” Tillis said.
The North Carolina senator said he also wanted a written explanation for Kennedy’s firing of a CDC director, attempts to stall NIH funding, the canceling of mRNA research contracts and the firing of advisory board members.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), that now includes some vaccine skeptics selected by Kennedy over the summer, will meet Sept. 18 and 19.
“They’re not just going to talk about COVID vaccines. They’re going to talk about childhood vaccines as well,” Wohl said. “We may see things like Hepatitis B, which could be eliminated from this planet if there was more vaccination be pulled from the schedule. Like all these things that really are just a rollback, I do think could be very consequential and dangerous.”
Some North Carolina pharmacies are waiting for more guidance before widely administering the COVID vaccine this year. Others are requiring a prescription. According to Stateline, at least five states — Colorado, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York and Pennsylvania — have opted to break from the FDA’s policy and make the COVID vaccines accessible to those who wish to have a booster this fall.
Wohl acknowledges the changing federal policy around COVID can be confusing.  He recommends North Carolinians talk to a trusted medical care provider, and make sure they stay up-to-date on the vaccines that are accessible.
This year’s flu shot targets three different strains of seasonal flu and reduces not only the severity of illness but cuts one’s risk of having to see their doctor for flu by about 50%. North Carolina recorded more than 500 flu-related deaths during last year’s respiratory virus season.
The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) offers a detailed respiratory virus surveillance dashboard tracking how much virus is circulating each week.
Beyond annual immunizations 
Beyond the Department of Health and Human Services’ vaccine policies, Wohl is waiting to see how the Trump administration’s budget cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) impact university research.
“If you really want to talk about what makes America great, we have been the best at this,” he said. “Nobody comes close to the innovation, the creativity that the NIH helps fund.”
Wohl said the billions of dollars the first Trump administration provided to rapidly develop and distribute the COVID shots was a triumph, and is now wrongly being called into question by vaccine skeptics.
“The investment leads to all sorts of consequential products. People are hired. People work, based upon the NIH funding. We hire loads of people to do this kind of research. These are all good things that have collateral benefits for communities,” he explained.
UNC was selected in the summer of 2023 to participate in NIH research on Long COVID. This June the university was forced to close the clinic after the loss of multiple funding sources.
One in 6 North Carolinians has experienced Long COVID, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.
“You know, it’s not a good return on investment to pull this money. It’s the opposite. I don’t hear a really good justification for why we should take a chainsaw to these institutions,” Wohl said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250908_145615-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-09-09 06:56:55.153683

Brent Taylor with the Board of Professional Responsibility. (Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)The final ethics complaint lodged against Shelby County’s district attorney by a state senator has been tossed.
District Attorney General Steve Mulroy released information showing the fifth and last ethics complaint filed against him by state Sen. Brent Taylor was dismissed by the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, the state body that handles ethics charges against attorneys.
Mulroy, a Democrat, said the Shelby County Republican lawmaker filed “groundless accusations” against him about the way he resolved two different cases, both alleging improper “ex parte” communications — without opposing attorneys present — with two different judges. 
Another dealt with what Mulroy called a “meritless” charge involving Juvenile Court records in adult court dealing with setting bail. 
Mulroy said the final case involved efforts he made with Juvenile Court Judge Tarik Sugarmon to consider the use of juvenile records, which Taylor favored in legislation approved this spring.

“Even though the outcome was positive, the intermediate experience was not,” Mulroy said in his newsletter. “I had to spend a fair amount of time and effort reviewing records and correspondence, documenting to the board what I did and why. It gave me a renewed appreciation for how stressful, expensive, time-consuming and life-disruptive criminal accusations can be, even if they are ultimately dismissed.”
Taylor was prepared last year to seek an ouster vote against Mulroy for “dereliction of duty” but couldn’t muster enough support in the Republican-controlled Senate to have him removed. Taylor then said he was going to request an investigation to determine whether the DA should be removed, but that never came to fruition.
Mulroy, who defeated Republican DA Amy Weirich in the last election, caught Taylor’s ire, in part, for introducing a plan to give non-violent felons “diversion” if they were caught carrying firearms. It was to be done case-by-case for those without a violent past or criminal history, but because of the uproar Mulroy declined to put the policy into place. 
Taylor did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

Jeff Landry’s administration has failed to regulate or provide oversight of public money given to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers over the past year, as required by state law. 

The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services did not monitor how state dollars were spent at pregnancy centers, create regulations for how they can use that money or track whether the centers met the goals of their state contracts, according to a report the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office released Monday. 

Those benchmarks were expected to be met under a 2024 state law to establish the Pregnancy and Baby Care Initiative, which replaced a similar state program called Alternatives to Abortion. 
“DCFS could have paid pregnancy centers for services ineligible for funding under state law,” read the report Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack submitted to lawmakers last Wednesday. 
For years, Louisiana has financially supported the controversial crisis pregnancy centers that were originally designed as competitors to abortion clinics. Their supporters say the centers, frequently affiliated with religious groups, offer assistance to pregnant people and new parents that is needed more than ever since Louisiana’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022. 
Critics said many of the centers misrepresent themselves as health care clinics, even when their staff members have little medical education. Some have also pushed unfounded medical concepts and treatments onto clients. 

For example, five of the pregnancy centers receiving state funding in the last year offer “abortion pill reversal” services, according to the auditor’s report. Such treatments have not been proven effective or safe and are denounced by leading physician organizations. 
In all, the state distributed $1.2 million to 12 crisis pregnancy centers from August 2024 to July 2025. Eleven of the 12 centers drew down the maximum funding the state offered of $100,800 during that period. 
The Landry administration intends to give the pregnancy centers more money this year. It has raised the annual cap for funding per center $249,999 in the current budget cycle, in spite of the auditor’s concerns about transparency. 
As of June, there were 38 pregnancy centers operating in Louisiana based on numbers in the audit report.

Lack of oversight
Louisiana lawmakers were specific about what services the state was willing to pay pregnancy centers to provide. 

The 2024 law that set up the Pregnancy and Baby Care Initiative states that only counseling, mentoring, classes and material items such as cribs or diapers can be covered with state money. It can also pay for referrals to other state agencies that can provide help with signing up for public benefits, child care or health programs. 

The auditor was unable to discern whether the state’s $1.2 million went toward covering these services because state officials did not require the pregnancy centers to provide documentation about where the money was spent. State contracts with the pregnancy centers also didn’t limit how the money could be used to what is laid out in the state statute.
Additionally, the Department of Children and Family Services told the auditor it never paid less than the maximum amount allowed of $300 per client per month to a pregnancy center over the first year of the program. 

“DCFS did not require pregnancy centers to bill only for services eligible for state funding or provide any additional supporting documentation for services provided,” according to the audit report. 
Got Medicaid? You’ll soon have access to doula services under a new Louisiana law

The centers provide a number of services to clients that are not supposed to be covered by the state including ultrasounds, at-home pregnancy tests, screenings for sexually transmitted infection and medication prescriptions. 
The agency also didn’t enforce state contract provisions that required the centers to meet certain service goals. It initially declined to impose more than $7,500 in fines on centers for missing those benchmarks, according to the auditor’s report. 
In response to the audit, the DCFS Secretary Rebecca Harris said she will implement more stringent reporting requirements for the centers and work to create state regulations by the end of the year. She will also make the centers pay the $7,500 in penalties they would have otherwise owed. 
“DCFS will not authorize payment for any services outside the scope of those permitted under state law,” Harris wrote in a letter to the auditor last month after receiving the report. 
Michelle Erenberg, executive director of abortion rights group Lift Louisiana, said she wasn’t surprised the state hasn’t monitored its spending with the pregnancy centers closely. She opposed the law, in part, because the reporting requirements weren’t stringent. 

“Several of these recommendations regarding oversight and transparency and more rigorous reporting are things that we have been suggesting that the legislature do for years,” Erenberg said in an interview Monday. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Umbrella nonprofit hasn’t been picked
Supporters of the pregnancy centers believe oversight of the program will improve once the Landry administration picks a nonprofit organization to run it. 

The 2024 law requires the Department of Children and Family Services to contract with a single nonprofit organization to distribute the state funding to pregnancy centers through subcontracts. The nonprofit is also supposed to set up a website and help promote the centers, according to state law. 
“We believe this program is done most effectively when a general contractor is named,” Ben Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group, said in an interview Monday. “We just urge the department to name a contractor for the best success.” 
The agency has not released the contract bid requirements for the nonprofit and, according to the report, will not have an organization hired for the job until July 2026, two years after the law was approved. The Department of Children and Family Services is struggling with the contract guidelines, according to the auditor, because of restrictions placed in the law. 

The statute does not allow the department to demand anything of the nonprofit except for the creation of a website and a commitment to do some marketing. Other “requirements” are explicitly forbidden, according to the law. 

In its report, the auditor questioned whether the nonprofit entity is even necessary or the best use of state funding. For years, the Department of Children and Family Services has contracted directly with pregnancy centers, and the auditor suggested it might be a waste of money to hire a middleman. 

“This could potentially decrease the funding available to pregnancy centers for services rendered because the general contractor will collect an administrative fee to pass funding from DCFS to the pregnancy centers,” according to the report. 
Other states with similar funding programs for pregnancy centers have also had problems when they have used nonprofit contractors to distribute the money. 
Texas overhauled its pregnancy center funding program – which distributes more than $100 million – this year after some anti-abortion centers appeared to be spending the money on activities other than direct services for pregnant people. Critics also alleged the state was overpaying for activities such as distributing pamphlets to clients. 
In Oklahoma, an auditor also found only $106,000 of $392,000 spent with its umbrella nonprofit went to pregnancy centers. The nonprofit said it was going to provide services to 9,300 women in Oklahoma over a year but only served 524, according to the Louisiana audit report. 

The man who set up those umbrella nonprofit organizations in Texas and Oklahoma, John McNamara, has been interested in working in Louisiana as well. 

In 2024, McNamara testified before a Louisiana Senate committee in favor of the law that established the new structure for funding pregnancy centers. 
He also reserved the name Louisiana Pregnancy Care Network with the Louisiana Secretary of State for a few months last year, though he didn’t end up purchasing it. The title is similar to the nonprofits he set up elsewhere, such as the Texas Pregnancy Care Network and the Oklahoma Pregnancy Care Network.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”
The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.
Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

(Louisiana Illuminator photo)Something remarkable is happening with the little brown lizards that have taken over the urban landscape of New Orleans. They’re living – and even thriving – with levels of lead in their blood that scientists say should be lethal to creatures that are far bigger, both two- and four-legged. 
A new Tulane University study on brown anoles could offer a better understanding of lead poisoning, how doctors can treat it and how wildlife evolves to live within an increasingly urban world, according to the researchers behind the findings. 
Doctors say there is no safe level of lead in blood for humans. When children are tested, the safe threshold is less than 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Lead levels above 45 micrograms require urgent medical attention and treatment. 
The average per-deciliter lead level in the lizards Tulane tested was 955 micrograms, according to the new research. 
“I was shocked,” said Annelise Blanchette, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency biologist who spearheaded the study for her doctoral thesis in evolutionary biology at Tulane University.

Older cities such as New Orleans deal with a long legacy of lead pollution from abandoned storage sites for leaded gasoline and lead-based pipes and paint that permeates its way into the soil. Lead doesn’t decompose over time, meaning its contamination risk remains indefinitely.
Children who are exposed to even low levels of lead face a risk of developmental delays, behavioral issues and damage to the brain, heart and kidneys.
Blanchette originally set out to discover how pollutants such as lead affect wildlife and focused on brown anoles out of convenience. Scientists say the anoles breathe in lead from the air and ingest it through the contaminated insects and water they consume.
“With the lizards being everywhere, so commonplace and being really great models in the lab, easy to keep in the lab, they were just kind of the natural next step,” she said. 
Brown anoles have spread across the eastern United States over the past 150 years, migrating aboard ships from Cuba and the Bahamas. They were first recorded in the Florida Keys in the 1880s and expanded rapidly throughout America in the 1940s. They’re believed to have established a foothold in New Orleans during the 1990s and have become the dominant low-level lizard since then, according to the Tulane study.   
It’s not easy being a green anole

The species thrives in suburban settings, where they have forced their cousins, the green anole, higher up into the treetops while the brown variety lives and hunts on the ground. Brown anoles have been mapped in 13 Louisiana parishes, concentrated in the southeastern part of the state. 
Blanchette said she had no idea she would find the anoles to be so hearty with such high amounts of lead in their bodies. Lizards collected in the field had the highest average and individual blood-lead concentration levels ever recorded in a wild mammal, bird, fish, amphibian or reptile, she said, making them the most lead-tolerant vertebrate currently known to science. 
“Everything else would be dead,” said Tulane assistant professor Alex Gunderson, who’s Blanchette’s adviser and co-author of the study. 
Beyond just surviving with such extreme levels of lead in their blood, the anoles showed no sign of typical lead poisoning— measured in loss of balance, speed and endurance when moving — until exposed to a level of lead in their blood nearly 10 times higher than scientists recorded in the wild. 
“I was absolutely shocked, but it was also very exciting because I knew then that the questions that we were interested in asking would be really interesting to answer,” said Blanchette. “These lizards could really potentially give us a lot of insight into lead tolerance and exposure.”
Beyond even a better understanding of the toxin itself, lead-resistant lizards could also offer hints as to how and why some creatures are better at adapting to a more polluted, human-heavy environment. 
“Clearly, they’re capable of handling toxic conditions that tend to be prevalent in human environments,” said Yoel Stuart, an evolutionary biologist and associate professor at Loyola University in Chicago. He has studied another type of anole to understand how the lizards evolve and just how quickly they are changing. 
To verify that the lizards are indeed adapting to higher levels of lead, Stuart said replicating the Tulane study in other locales could help answer unknown questions and inform efforts to prevent extinction for more vulnerable species as the world faces a critical loss of biodiversity. 
“I would love to know: If you feed a bunch of lead to a brown anole from a place where there’s as little lead as you can find, how do they do?” Stuart said. “If [New Orleans anoles] die at way lower levels than these lizards, that suggests that the New Orleans lizards have adapted. If the brown anoles [in another location] happen to be more resistant, then it could be that they’ve always had the right tools to deal with lead.”
Blanchette said researchers have some theories as to how brown anoles can handle such extreme levels of lead, such as producing more red blood cells to counteract the effect lead has on carrying oxygen throughout the body. But it’s also possible brown anoles deal with lead in a way that has nothing to do with oxygen, she said.
Either way, the findings could be big. 
“Is it something that we can expect lots of species to be able to do, or a subset of species to be able to do? That can inform conservation strategies,” Stuart said. “It might help us target places where we need to mitigate lead in the environment.”
Gunderson said finding an animal so tolerant to such a potent toxin indicates their bodies are doing something humans don’t fully understand — and need to study. He spoke to the importance of broad exploration in research, adding that unexpected findings such as this uncover secrets that might have otherwise remained hidden.
“I don’t think anyone would have expected lizards to be this lead-tolerant,” he said. “It’s important to study everything … you don’t know what you don’t know, right?”

The State of Florida has moved to end all school vaccine mandates. The very notion is absurd. And it appears that other states will, most certainly, follow, including West Virginia. 
Recently, West Virginia Watch reporter Lori Kersey reported that West Virginia’s new acting health officer, Dr. Mark McDaniel, agrees with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s position that West Virginia families can opt out of the state’s school vaccination requirements for religious reasons. 
“I agree with Gov. Morrisey’s position that no West Virginian should ever be forced to choose between their religious convictions and access to education,” McDaniel said. He also said that vaccines are “one of the tools proven to reduce disease, hospitalization and death.” He continued, “We respect the role of parents as the primary decision-makers for their children’s health.” If you’re following me, then perhaps you’re as confused as I am. Stay with me.
Kersey referenced a poll released from WV MetroNews indicating that 71% of respondents support the state’s school vaccination requirements. OK. Then why are we accepting Morrisey’s and McDaniel’s move away from what the people of West Virginia have made so clear that they want? Again, absurd. When did “we, the people” become so irrelevant? 
Common sense (which I know has become obviously unassociated with career politicians) shows that vaccines work — have always served as a buffer to preventing disease, hospitalization and death. Let me get this straight: a parent can decide to withhold school vaccine mandates due to religious beliefs, but it’s acceptable that in doing so, their child can spread the disease to other children? Absurd has taken on a whole new meaning. 
McDaniel linked a deadly measles outbreak in Texas to migrants crossing the country’s southern border. I’m certain that you’ll agree that the level of absurdity soars. “Stop illegals from bringing it across the border,” Kersey reported that McDaniel commented on a LinkedIn post. Oh, so now immigration enters the picture. Are you still with me? Are you connecting the dots? Keep in mind that Texas health officials (as reported by Kersey) say they don’t know what led to a measles outbreak that hospitalized nearly 100 people and killed two children. 
Kersey ends her reporting with these words from McDaniel: “[My] commitment as state health officer is to serve the state with honesty, transparency and accountability.” Hmm. Two points: you mean to serve West Virginians, not the state, correct? And we’re all looking for a politician whose core values are honesty, transparency and accountability. We beg to know who they are, because even with the clearest vision, they are nowhere to be found during these most unsettling, turbulent times, not only in West Virginia, but across this great country.

Gov. Andy Beshear told the crowd he would veto a bill aimed at reversing his executive order restricting conversion therapy. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)The Kentucky Board of Social Work says a licensed counselor violated no laws when he wrote a social media post about the LGBTQ+ community in which he said “I personally (and professionally) never want to affirm rebellion against our Creator.” 
The organization representing former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis in her efforts to overturn marriage equality is defending the social worker who was reportedly fired because of what he said in the post.
Florida-based Liberty Counsel said the unnamed counselor was employed by a Leitchfield health and wellness organization and is trying to be reinstated to his job, though it’s unclear how. A spokesperson for the Christian organization said “Liberty Counsel and the counselor are pursuing appropriate remedies” and to expect “more updates in the near future.”  
Liberty Counsel laid out a sequence of events in a response on the social worker’s behalf to complaints that had been filed against him with the profession’s Kentucky governing board. The social worker’s name and that of his employer are redacted in the version of the response, dated July 18, that Liberty Counsel released. The address of his former employer is not redacted.
Liberty Counsel says the man was fired after making a social media post in June in which he wrote, “I’m a licensed mental health professional and there’s constant pressure to compromise beliefs to make people happy in this field (and in all our lives in general).” 
His comments came after his employer made a post honoring Pride Month, held in June to honor the 1969 Stonewall uprisings, during which the LGBTQ+ community resisted police raids of gay bars and other discrimination. 
“I love my career and the people I serve with a passion, but I’m not going to sell my soul for it. While places I work might be a ‘safe and affirming space for lqbtqia+ (sic) community,’ I personally (and professionally) never want to affirm rebellion against our Creator,” the post said, according to Liberty Counsel. “What good does it do if we gain the whole world — my favorite job, perfect mental health even — if we lose our own soul? I’ve recently watched previously sold Christians sell out on this issue. Count me out. I’m His, and sticking to His Word. The rainbow…reminds us He won’t flood the earth with water again because of all this crap, but dang, there’s a fire coming.” 
In follow-up comments, the social worker said he recognizes “the dignity and worth of every person” and said that “loving well is important.” 
“I think it’s a disservice to the counseling profession to encourage people to keep doing things that hurt them,” he said, according to Liberty Counsel. “I know you agree with that. We all have to judge daily. What is bad is judging wrongly or judging with a plank in our own eye. Our disagreement has to be whether or not sex outside of God’s word is mentally injuring. I believe so many disorders are ultimately caused by sin and the fall of man.” 
The Kentucky Board of Social Work reviewed ethical complaints filed against the counselor, according to an August letter shared by Liberty Counsel and a video record of the August board meeting. After reviewing state law, the board “concluded that the facts alleged in this matter do not constitute any apparent violation of Kentucky law governing the practice of social work,” according to the letter sent by the board’s executive director to the counselor.
The board had a brief discussion of the complaints, none of which came from clients, during the August board meeting and ultimately voted that there wasn’t sufficient evidence that the social worker violated ethics or law. 
State law says the board can “revoke, suspend or refuse to issue or renew; impose probationary or supervisory conditions upon; impose an administrative fine; issue a written reprimand or admonishment; or any combination of actions regarding any applicant, license, or licensee upon proof” that the person in question violated Kentucky’s code of ethical conduct or committed other offenses. 
The code of ethics directs social workers to “promote the well-being of a client,” “not illegally discriminate against an individual,” “provide a service to a client in a manner that is respectful and appreciative of the client’s culture” and much more. 
Marc Kelly, the executive director of the Kentucky Board of Social Work, said the documents “speak for themselves.”

“The licensee’s social media posts and other comments are likely distasteful and appalling to most social workers,” Kelly said, but “they were not considered a violation of (the law).” 
“The postings made may have resulted in a dismissal but that is not necessarily a violation of law,” he said. 
Rev. Brandon Long, an ordained minister who lives in Fort Thomas and has been open about his experience with conversion therapy, said this case represents a need to “do better.” 
“We should be honest about what this is. If a licensed professional went online after their employer wished everyone a ‘Happy Black History Month’ and said they could never affirm Black people, or if they responded to their employer celebrating ‘International Women’s Day’ by insisting women should remain silent and submissive, we would immediately recognize that as bigotry, not faith,” Long said. “The same standard applies when LGBTQ people are targeted. It is the same logic of segregation, dressed up in new language.”
The First Amendment and protected class 
One of the complaints filed but then dismissed by the board (and cited in Liberty Counsel’s July 18 response) alleges the counselor’s social media post “was accessible to clients and was viewed by clients (some commented on the post).” The code of of ethical conduct restricts “dual relationships” between counselors and clients, though it doesn’t specifically address being connected on social media.  A dual relationship means a social, personal or business relationship between a social worker and client coexists with their professional relationship.
Liberty Counsel made the case that the speech in the social worker’s social media post was protected by the First Amendment, which protects freedom of assembly, speech, religion and the press; the 14th Amendment; the Kentucky Constitution and the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

“First Amendment speech and religious protections do not disappear when someone becomes a licensed counselor,” Liberty Counsel founder and chairman Mat Staver said in a statement. “These frivolous complaints are a clear attempt to unconstitutionally silence and censor opposing views. There was no jurisdiction or cause here to regulate this counselor’s speech or discipline him based on private expressions of religious and political beliefs. The counselor’s employer should reinstate him immediately and correct this potentially costly mistake.” 
A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky said the First Amendment “only protects people from government prosecution (and) persecution” and that private companies in Kentucky can hire or fire people over speech. 
The employer in this case is redacted in Liberty Counsel’s documents. The organization believed to be the counselor’s former employer said it wouldn’t comment on the issue. 
Meanwhile, Liberty Counsel asserts that “Kentucky law does not recognize ‘LGBTQ’ (or the words for which the acronym stands), nor ‘sexual orientation’ nor ‘gender identity’ as protected classes, but it does recognize ‘religion’ as a protected class.” 
Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Chris Hartman, the executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said that “as a technicality, they are right — that those four words are not included in the protected classes, thus explicitly including LGBTQ people.” 
However, he said, the United States Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County means that “sex as a protected class includes sexual orientation and gender identity,” therefore sexual orientation and gender identity are “implicitly protected in sex discrimination, both federally and statewide.” 
Long, the minister, said any public professional has an “obligation to put personal bias aside in order to care for every client with dignity.” 
“When boards, courts and governments allow this type of discrimination to continue without consequence, they are not protecting religious freedom, they are rebuilding segregation for a new era,” Long said. “We can, and must, do better.”

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last week, asking him not to eliminate mine safety research positions at a Pittsburgh-area federal facility.","Aerial shot of the NIOSH campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County. (Photo from the CDC)State Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Jessica Shirley sent a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last week, asking him not to eliminate mine safety research positions at a Pittsburgh-area federal facility.
“The loss of the [Pittsburgh Research Lab] facility and its subject matter experts would not be in the best interest of miner’s health and safety,” Shirley’s letter said. “Pennsylvania has a long legacy of mining – stretching back hundreds of years – and we owe it to our mine workers, their families, and mining communities to ensure their safety and continue this critical research.”
The letter was first reported by Fox 43, a central Pennsylvania television station.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) employed roughly 300 employees working out of a campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County, before federal job cuts began at the beginning of the year.
The campus is also home to the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, formerly referred to as the Pittsburgh Research Lab, how Shirley identifies it. Its workers study the best ways to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses in mines and currently employs dozens of federal workers. 
The facility is also home to the National Personal Protective Technology Lab, which certifies the nation’s NIOSH-approved respirators.
Lilas Soukup, president of AFGE 1916, the local chapter of the federal employees union representing Pittsburgh’s NIOSH workers, said the exact number of employees still working at the Bruceton NIOSH campus is hard to pin down. She said she’s unsure how many employees resigned, took buyouts or early retirement offers. Since the Trump administration moved to stop recognizing federal collective bargaining contracts at HHS, the agency has stopped sharing certain information about employees with the union, Soukup added.

As it stands, virtually all employees of the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division have been given what’s called a “Reduction In Force” notice, meaning their positions are slated to be eliminated. However, in a lawsuit filed in a federal District Court in Rhode Island, a judge ordered HHS to halt layoffs for the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division and other parts of the agency until the case is resolved.
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS did not answer direct questions about their plans for the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, but said in a statement, “the Trump Administration is committed to supporting miners, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
Shirley said in her letter that the state Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) Bureau of Mine Safety collaborates with the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division to keep Pennsylvania’s roughly 3,000 miners safe.
“[The Pittsburgh Research Lab] and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety have routinely worked collaboratively and cooperatively for many years, to provide training, best practices and tools to aid the mining industry,” Shirley wrote. “The Bureau believes the permanent closure of the PRL facility is cause for concern.” 
Brendan Demich, a NIOSH employee speaking in his capacity as vice president of AFGE 1916, said collaborative work includes training mine rescue teams through a virtual reality program developed by his team, and simulating rescues at their on-site research mine. The underground research mine, Demich said, is the only one of its kind operated by the U.S. government.
Demich said members of his team at NIOSH were also researching best practices to keep miners safe in mines near gas wells, which he said was intended to be shared with DEP.
For months, workers at the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division have faced an uncertain future amid the Trump administration’s efforts to slash and reshape the federal workforce. While all are on administrative leave, some have been called back or continued to come into work.
Slated cuts to mine safety workers have caught the attention of lawmakers from both parties, who have grilled Sec. Kennedy on them at hearings on Capitol Hill.
In June, all seven Democratic members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation signed onto a letter opposing plans to cut mine safety research jobs in Pittsburgh.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CDC-lab-Pitt.jpg,,,2025-09-09 05:57:50.148047

It might be our world-famous natural places, from the mighty Mississippi River in the west to the Appalachian Mountains in the east. 
Or it could be any one of the cave systems, forests, rivers, lakes or parks in between. It might be our historic bourbon industry, which has influenced our nation’s history since the American Revolution. Perhaps you imagine our iconic horse farms, cattle pastures or our rolling fields of soybeans and corn, all of which provide the backbone of our agricultural sector.

No matter what you picture, there is one thing that connects it all — our lands and waters. From hunting to bourbon to agriculture to recreation, our economy and quality of life depend on healthy soil, clean water and abundant natural and working lands. We have been blessed with incredible natural resources, and they have supported our growth and prosperity for centuries. 
However, those resources are not unlimited, and we have a responsibility to invest in their sustainability. State lawmakers in Frankfort have already begun to turn their attention to this challenge by making targeted investments in critical projects like Cumberland Forest and existing programs like the Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund. We deeply appreciate these meaningful commitments, but we must do more. 
The good news is that many of our neighboring states are already providing examples of how to make larger investments in conservation a consistent element of their state budgets. Just to our south, Tennessee’s leaders invest tens of millions of dollars per year into land and water conservation. In comparison, Kentucky averages less than $3 million per year. 
Even Mississippi, a state with a yearly budget half the size of ours, has devoted $12 million annually to conservation through their outdoor stewardship trust fund in recent budget cycles. Given the billions of dollars in economic returns and the priceless cultural, recreational, and health benefits our forests, fields, rivers, and mountains provide, we must do more to conserve them. 
There is a mandate from Kentuckians to act as well, with 96% of us agreeing that we owe it to future generations to protect our natural resources and 86% supporting additional state funding to do so. 
From the simplest solution of appropriating more money to conservation to more targeted pathways like tax credits and sales tax revenue from outdoor gear sales, there are many avenues to increased conservation funding.
 One common sense solution comes to us from Georgia, which began dedicating a portion of its sales tax revenue from sporting goods sales to conservation after 83% of voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018. Without raising taxes by a single penny, that simple change has already resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in new conservation investments in Georgia. 
Kentucky’s lands and waters are not just a connection to our past — they are an integral part of a vibrant and prosperous future. The Nature Conservancy stands ready to serve as a resource and lend our decades of experience to lawmakers as they determine our best path forward. For the sake of our families and our future, the time to act is now.

Pennsylvania’s approach offers a roadmap other states can follow.,"Pittsburgh's AlphaLab Health (Innovation Works' life sciences accelerator). (Photo courtesy of AlphaLab Health)Pennsylvania lawmakers recently announced they will propose bipartisan legislation to regulate artificial intelligence use in health care. While other states scramble to catch up with the rapidly advancing technology, Pennsylvania has been quietly building the foundation for responsible AI innovation in life sciences all along.
The commonwealth’s health care AI ecosystem already embodies the principles this legislation aims to protect: human oversight, clinical validation, and technology that augments rather than replaces clinician judgment. Companies across the state have been developing AI solutions with clinicians as partners since day one, ensuring solutions address genuine clinical needs rather than just deploying the technology as a box to check off.
This approach creates a competitive advantage. Pennsylvania attracts serious innovators who understand that sustainable health care AI requires both cutting-edge science and unwavering commitment to patient safety. Paired with well-respected health networks like Penn Medicine, UPMC, and Allegheny Health Network, the state is uniquely positioned to lead in the responsible use of AI in life sciences.
While the AI health care market races toward $188 billion globally by 2030, according to Grand View Research, Pennsylvania companies are capturing significant funding and developing breakthrough technologies that could change how medicine is practiced.
The proposed legislation codifies best practices that Pennsylvania’s most successful health care AI companies already follow.
Innovation with purpose
Pennsylvania’s health care startup ecosystem has built something special through partnerships with major health systems like Allegheny Health Network. Take DermaBio, a Pittsburgh-based company developing an AI-powered precision medicine platform. Its technology uses a simple non-invasive skin sample to predict which biologic therapies will work for patients’ autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. The clinical impact is significant: Biologic therapy typically involves costly trial and error, wasting over $10,000 per patient when treatments fail, with 25% of patients experiencing no response at all.
But DermaBio doesn’t position itself as an “AI company.” It exemplifies problem-first innovation by using its algorithms to analyze skin biomarkers and clinical data to provide actionable insights, but physicians retain full authority over treatment decisions.
Astria Biosciences tackles a different challenge. The company is developing a blood-based test to detect and risk-stratify cerebral aneurysms, a condition affecting up to one in 50 people that currently requires expensive, invasive diagnostics. Astria’s CAT-7 test achieves 95% sensitivity using AI analysis of blood biomarkers, providing aneurysm detection and risk stratification data that informs, rather than dictates, clinical decisions.
Both companies demonstrate what happens when AI development starts with clinician partnership rather than technology seeking a problem. 
This ecosystem approach extends beyond individual companies. University connections — particularly with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University — create a pipeline from research to commercialization that few regions can match. When research institutions, health care systems, and startups collaborate from the beginning, the resulting innovations naturally incorporate the human oversight and clinical validation that effective AI regulation requires.
A model for other states
Effective AI regulation channels innovation toward meaningful outcomes responsibly rather than stifling it. Pennsylvania’s approach offers a roadmap other states can follow.
By requiring human oversight, transparency, and bias minimization, Pennsylvania is establishing standards that protect patients while encouraging the kind of clinically grounded innovation happening across the state.
This regulatory approach also creates competitive advantages. Companies developing health care AI tools want to work in environments where they can build sustainable, ethical products. States that establish clear, reasonable standards will attract the innovators who are serious about improving patient outcomes.
Health care AI done right creates jobs and builds the kind of high-value industries that drive regional prosperity. Pennsylvania is proving that states don’t have to choose between innovation and patient protection. With the right ecosystem and smart regulation, they can have both.

(Courtesy of CPW)From parenting to work to law enforcement, “three strikes and you’re out” is a concept everyone understands. The same should apply to the attempts to pause or end Colorado’s voter-approved wolf reintroduction.
Since January, cattleman associations, citizen groups, and legislators have tried — and failed — to reverse history.
Almost every news story about wolves in Colorado mentions the “narrowly passed” reintroduction ballot initiative. Yes, it was narrow. But it passed.
Meanwhile, every subsequent attempt by opponents of the wolf program to reverse the initiative has ended in a crushing defeat. Under the three strikes model, the failure of a petition to the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to pause the reintroduction, the defeat of a legislative proposal to halt the program, and the rejection of a ballot initiative to end it — all within 2025 — should signal that Coloradans support the continued success of the wolf reintroduction.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Strike one. On Jan. 8, the CPW Commission heard a petition calling for a pause in wolf reintroductions unless seven concerns were addressed. For the 11-member commission, “narrow” denial might have been 5–6 or even 4–7.  But the petition was rejected by an impressive 10-1 vote.
Strike two. In August, lawmakers convened for a special session after President Donald Trump’s H.R. 1 blew a hole in Colorado’s balanced budget with an estimated a $1.2 billion loss in state revenue. A handful of lawmakers sought to address the budget crisis by pausing the wolf program and redirecting $264,000 of general fund money meant for CPW’s next relocation — cutting the deficit by a minuscule fraction of 1%. In the end, they did get their tiny fortune removed from wolf reintroduction efforts. However, an amendment was passed that removed language preventing CPW from using other funds to continue the reintroduction.
Strike three. Initiative 13, titled “End Wolf Reintroduction,” was filed by Colorado Advocates for Smart Wolf Policy — which actually wanted a “no wolf policy” — on Feb. 19, initiating a six-month attempt to undermine public-supported reintroduction. Their embarrassing result makes this year’s Colorado Rockies performance seem heroic in comparison. To qualify for the ballot, 124,238 valid signatures are required. In practice, that means 160,000–200,000 signatures are needed to account for invalid ones. How many did the group collect? Twenty-five thousand — about one-sixth of the actual goal. Their excuse wasn’t a lack of public support but a lack of money for paid circulators. But that itself is telling: If people believed in the cause, they would have invested time, energy and money to make it successful. It is true that securing donations is part of the modern ballot initiative process. The use of paid circulators is standard practice, but isn’t necessarily required to obtain sufficient signatures. I led the signature effort for last year’s Proposition 127, which would have prohibited mountain lion hunting and bobcat trapping. For that campaign, volunteers collected 117,669 of our 187,147 total signatures; by comparison, this campaign managed just 25,000 — 92,000 fewer on a volunteer-to-volunteer basis.
The failures of this narrow group of anti-wolf special interests are undeniable. Coloradans don’t support efforts to stop wolf reintroduction — not with their votes, signatures or wallets. The people have spoken three times: We want wolves.
The media, lawmakers and others using wolves as a weapon of division should stop and recognize this program for what it truly is: a historic effort, supported by the majority, to restore wolves to their rightful home.

Gov. Josh Stein speaks to members of the media at Kipos Greek Taverna in Chapel Hill after flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The governor of North Carolina earns an annual salary of a little over $200,000 per year. While it’s only about a fifth or less of what the average partner in a big law firm can expect to bring home and a fiftieth what the football coach at the state’s flagship university rakes in, it’s still good money. In a state where the median household income is around only a third of that amount and millions subsist at or below the poverty line, for most people, getting a job with a 200k salary would feel like winning the lottery.
And yet, for the current inhabitant of the Governor’s Mansion – Democrat Josh Stein — it must feel at times like he’s in a job for which no salary could provide adequate compensation.
Consider for a moment how dramatically different Stein’s job is from, say, the one undertaken by Gov. Jim Hunt during the four terms he served between 1977-1985 and 1993-2001.
During Hunt’s 16 years in office, the governor dominated state politics. Even without the ability to veto bills – the governor only won that right after the constitution was amended during Hunt’s final term – Hunt enjoyed mostly good working relationships with the legislature (even during periods when the GOP controlled the state House), as well as congressional leaders and presidential administrations of both parties. His budgets and policy priorities – like the Smart Start initiative, dramatically boosting public education funding, and recovery plans from major hurricanes like Fran and Floyd — were approved by lawmakers with little question.
What a difference a quarter century makes.
While Stein was elected to office by a healthy margin last November and has remained extremely popular with voters ever since, his first months in office could not have been more different from what Hunt (and most other 20th Century governors) experienced.
Even before he took office in January, Republican legislative leaders attacked him repeatedly and personally and moved to reduce his powers. And even on issues that have traditionally led to bipartisan agreement like disaster relief, winning approval for any of his policies has been akin to pulling teeth.
And then, of course, there is the matter of President Trump and his minions in Congress. From Day One of his administration, Stein has found himself in an impossible situation on this front – especially when it comes to his top priority, Hurricane Helene recovery.
Whether telling lies about the situation on the ground in western North Carolina, working to abolish FEMA, or slashing funding for essential relief programs and other critical federal initiatives, Trump and company have made Stein’s job doubly difficult at every turn.
This situation reached a new low last week when Trump – faced with repeated requests from Stein for federal aid to speed the sluggish Helene recovery – went into full bully mode, blasting Stein’s requests as somehow showing that he is “unfit to run the state.”
It was classic Trump bluster – the kind of wild, fact-free and blame-deflecting claim that has long marked his public life and that would understandably provoke many a reasonable politician to respond with fire of their own.
Amazingly and impressively, however, through it all, Stein has refused to take the bait. Somewhat unlike his predecessor, Roy Cooper, who made public warring with the political right – particular GOP legislative leaders — a regular feature of his eight years in office, Stein continues to adhere to a course of remarkable, almost Zen-like, calm and civility.
In response to Trump’s outrageous broadside, Stein kept his cool and stuck to the facts — telling news outlets only that he is “grateful for the federal government’s support” and that the size of Congress’ appropriation to WNC is “simply not enough to get the job done, and it’s much less than what other states have received after similar catastrophic storms.”
That approach echoes how Stein has dealt with the Trumpian legislature since January. While, like Cooper, Stein has issued plenty of vetoes and voiced pointed disagreement on several occasions with the legislature’s actions and inactions, there’s been a notable difference in the volume and tone of how he’s gone about it, and he’s regularly looked for opportunities to extend olive branches to GOP leaders.
How much all of this represents a strategic decision on the part of a disciplined politician with hopes for a career in public service that could extend long after Donald Trump is gone, and how much it simply reflects his personality, is not entirely clear at this point.
Sometimes in politics, when you don’t have the votes to get what you want, you just don’t have the votes and must focus on what you can control. And whether, say, a Gov. Stein in 2029 would be able to continue to project the same chill persona if he were still battling hostile GOP supermajorities and personal attacks seems somewhat hard to imagine.
For now, though, Stein seems intent on sticking to a genteel approach that’s at odds with the rancorous times we inhabit. Would that it turns out to be contagious.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182519-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 05:57:50.148047

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)In Raleigh’s Idlewild neighborhood, where formerly enslaved people once secured land as a foothold to freedom, history is repeating itself in a new way. This summer, shovels hit the ground on 18 homes that will remain affordable—not just for the first buyers, but for every family who comes after them. In a state where housing costs are climbing out of reach, this project is more than construction. It is proof that permanent affordability is not only possible in North Carolina—it’s essential.
The Crisis We Face
The numbers tell the story. In Wake County, rents climbed 46 percent in just five years. Across North Carolina, home prices rose 37 percent between 2020 and 2023. The results are predictable: our communities’ essential workers are being priced out of the neighborhoods they serve. Young families delay homeownership altogether. Seniors on fixed incomes watch their neighborhoods change around them with nowhere affordable to go. Service workers, who keep our economy running, are forced into long commutes or unstable housing.
This is more than an economic issue—it’s a threat to the fabric of our communities. When the people who staff our hospitals, teach our children, and respond to emergencies can’t afford to live nearby, everyone feels the strain. Rising costs don’t just displace families; they weaken schools, erode trust in neighborhoods, and hollow out the diversity that makes our cities strong.
A Permanent Solution
Most approaches to affordable housing offer only temporary relief. Community land trusts (CLTs) take a different path. A CLT holds land in trust for the community, permanently removing it from the real estate market. Homes built on that land are sold at affordable prices, with resale restrictions to ensure they remain affordable—not just for one family, but for every family after them.
At the Cottages of Idlewild, families earning modest incomes—roughly $50,000 to $80,000 for a family of four—will have the chance to purchase homes starting at $145,000. That’s less than a third of the county’s current median.
Deep Roots, Proven Results
The CLT model has deep roots in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, leaders in Albany, Georgia, created New Communities, the nation’s first CLT, as a safeguard against injustice and displacement. Today, more than 300 CLTs operate across the country, including a dozen in North Carolina.
The evidence is compelling. During the 2008 foreclosure crisis, CLT homeowners were far less likely to lose their homes because CLTs act as long-term partners, stepping in with counseling and support when challenges arise. Studies show that CLT homeowners enjoy greater financial stability, better health outcomes, and stronger civic participation. Many eventually buy market-rate homes, using their CLT purchase as a stepping stone to broader security.
The Path Forward for North Carolina
The North Carolina housing crisis is not abstract. It shows up in the teacher commuting an hour each way because she can’t afford to live near her school. It shows up in the service worker forced to move every year as rents rise. CLTs give us a way forward—one that ensures stability for families and permanence for our communities.
That’s why the model matters beyond Idlewild. If scaled across the state, community land trusts could create a permanent stock of affordable housing that grows over time, shielding working families from market volatility and protecting neighborhoods from displacement. Unlike programs that expire, CLTs build affordability into the DNA of a community. They don’t just slow the crisis: they solve for it.
North Carolina now faces a choice. We can keep chasing temporary answers, or we can invest in solutions that last. The Cottages of Idlewild show what’s possible when permanence is the goal.
Because in the end, housing should never be temporary. Every North Carolinian deserves not just a place to live, but a lasting place to belong.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCN0568-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 12:58:28.823025

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, pledges a progressive agenda should she earn a four-year stay at the Executive Mansion. She has laid out ambitious agendas to reform immigration policies, uphold reproductive rights, strengthen public education, expand health care access, and further clean energy goals. 
Spanberger has held a steady lead over her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears this year, although the race has narrowed in recent weeks. A Roanoke College poll released last month found 46% of likely voters would choose Spanberger, compared to 39% who would pick  Earle-Sears. Support has edged up for both candidates since the spring, when 43% said they’d vote for Spanberger and 26% chose Earle-Sears as their candidate. Spanberger has raised over $27 million and has more than $15 million in her campaign’s coffers. Earle-Sears’ campaign has raised over $11.5 million, according to her latest campaign finance filings, with $4.5 million in cash on hand.
A married mom of three daughters, Spanberger is the daughter of a career federal law enforcement officer and a nurse, and grew up in Central Virginia. She worked as a case officer at the federal Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2014, investigating and deflecting terror threats against the country. She represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District from 2018 to 2024 and built a reputation as an effective bipartisan collaborator in the nation’s capital. Just before he left office in January, former President Joe Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act into law, legislation co-sponsored by Spanberger, that aims to boost retirement benefits for some retirees that draw public pensions, such as former police officers and firefighters.
The Virginia Mercury reached out to both campaigns to learn more about their priorities and how they match up with Virginians’, and to learn how they plan to accomplish their legislative goals. Earle-Sears agreed to an interview but canceled on the day of and has not responded to requests to reschedule and other questions. In August, Spanberger sat down with the Mercury’s team at her campaign office in Central Virginia. Here’s an in-depth review of her positions and promises.
 Energy and environment

Utility companies have warned that the power demands in severe weather conditions and the growing thirst from data centers means that the commonwealth has to step up its energy production. With the Virginia Clean Economy Act mandating the transition into renewable energy sources, some lawmakers have proposed eliminating it completely. Democrats, including Spanberger, have rejected that idea but said the state should consider tweaking the law to meet the current and future energy challenges.
“I think (we need) an evaluation of where we have had successes, but also, importantly in some places, where have technologies changed?  Battery storage technology has improved significantly and has a much greater utility than it even did five years ago,” Spanberger said. “And so I think, certainly with the same goals, (we should be) determining … where we should perhaps recalibrate or some places where we can look towards more aggressive forward leaning.”
Virginia is also on the frontlines of climate change impacts, with rapidly rising sea levels in coastal Hampton Roads and devastating impacts of severe weather now reaching all regions of the state, as seen in Southwest Virginia after Hurricane Helene. The federal government recently cut millions of dollars in funding for flood mitigation and other resiliency projects. Spanberger said she plans to return Virginia to the Region Greenhouse Gas Initiative that will bring in dollars that can be used for those projects.
“I think the governor has to lead these conversations and bring resiliency efforts into everything that the state might prioritize. Road investments, bridge investments, new structures coming to Virginia, businesses that we are attracting, agriculture space efforts to make sure that we’re doing everything possible,” Spanberger said.
Spanberger laid out her energy and environment goals in a plan, released in June.

 Health care

Sweeping changes to Medicaid and hospital funding mechanisms are on the horizon, after Congress passed the sprawling reconciliation bill backed by President Donald Trump. As governor, Spanberger or Earle-Sears could sign off on future state budgets and legislation to address the impact. 
Noting her “disdain and sarcasm” in her recent interview with The Mercury, Spanberger said the “only benefit” of Congress’ pending changes having a delayed effect is that “it does give us a little bit more time to plan.” 
As thousands of Virginians could lose their Medicaid coverage, hospitals are also bracing for absorbing higher costs before being faced with cutting services, closing, or negotiating higher rates with private insurers. 
Meanwhile, Congress has until the end of the year to decide whether to renew expiring tax credits that help people without employer-provided health insurance purchase plans. Aetna has already announced it is leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace by the end of the year. The reduction of credits could leave more people uninsured and increase the potential for reliance on free clinics, federally-qualified health centers and hospitals. 
To counter this, Spanberger said she is analyzing “some of the states where the delivery of Medicaid services are just top notch.”
When asked for more details, Spanberger’s team shared that she would invest in both the digital infrastructure and workforce to modernize the state’s Medicaid eligibility system so that case workers can better “help Virginians navigate a burdensome system.”
Earlier in the summer, she also unveiled her broader health care plans that include increasing generic drug manufacturing in the state’s hub of medical manufacturing companies, supporting funding boosts to the state’s free clinics, and supporting forthcoming pharmacy benefit manager reform. Supporters of the latter say it would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat.

 Immigration

Spanberger has made clear she would take a different approach to immigration enforcement than Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
She said she would rescind Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which directs localities to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, calling it a misappropriation of local resources. 
“The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies … so that they can go and tear families apart … is a misuse of those resources,” Spanberger said. She pointed to Prince William County, which she once represented in Congress, where she said a similar partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cost the county more than $1 million in jail expenses.
Spanberger also questioned Youngkin’s claim that joint operations with ICE resulted in the arrest of 2,500 violent criminals, saying such cases should already be documented in the criminal justice system. 
“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed,” she said. She argued that conflating immigration violations with criminal acts erodes trust between communities and law enforcement, making victims and witnesses less likely to come forward.
As governor, Spanberger said she would use the office to press Congress to advance  long-stalled immigration legislation. 
She cited the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, the Dignity Act and a bipartisan U.S. Senate compromise as steps toward overhauling what she called a “broken and outdated” system. 
Spanberger also defended her vote against the Laken Riley Act, which requires ICE to detain immigrants accused of theft and other crimes, emphasizing that she opposed the measure because it imposed costly burdens on localities and stripped away due process. 
“If someone is going to be arrested for a crime, they should be arrested,” she said. “But the bill … wouldn’t have stopped her murder.”
 Public education

Spanberger wants to keep as much public funding flowing into Virginia’s public schools as possible, and vowed to protect LGBTQ+ students’ rights if elected governor.
In her “Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan,” released this summer, Spanberger rejected efforts to divert public funds to voucher programs championed by Youngkin, Earle-Sears and other Republicans in the state. She pledged to bolster child care and early childhood education programs, K-12 schools, and institutions of higher education, while finding solutions to stem the state’s teacher shortage.
Spanberger believes Virginia needs to focus on “strengthening its schools and expanding opportunities for all students, not defunding public schools,” she said, following reports that Virginia ranks last in the country in student math recovery post-pandemic.
As governor, Spanberger would “make it a priority to give public schools the resources to explore best and promising practices through innovative career and technical education programs and work-based learning,” her campaign stated in response to follow-up questions after her interview with The Mercury.
Spanberger also opposes policies that would harm LGBTQ+ children and has railed against reforms by the Youngkin administration that mandate students use school bathrooms that align with their sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity and that teachers address students by the name and pronouns aligning with the students’ gender assigned at birth. Spanberger reportedly claimed the governor’s reforms could be “unconstitutional” and could hurt the commonwealth’s business prospects and economy, The National Review reported.
In her August interview with The Mercury, Spanberger expressed her views on balancing parental rights and children’s privacy. She said she supports more proactive information-sharing that enhances safety without compromising students’ rights. She also believes that Virginia has the potential to lead in addressing communication barriers related to issues such as school overdose incidents and teacher arrests involving children.
During her time in Congress, Spangberger voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023, which prohibits school athletic programs from allowing individuals whose assigned sex at birth is male to participate in programs that are for women or girls. The measure passed 219-203.
 Reproductive rights

Spanberger said she would “absolutely veto” any restrictions on abortions, contraception or fertility treatments should they make it to her desk as the potential next governor. 
She said she supports an in-progress effort to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia’s constitution. Having already passed the legislature once, it must do so again next year before it could appear on statewide ballots for voters’ final approval or rejection. 
Spanberger is advocating for the amendment’s passage now, while the entire House of Delegates is up for election this year with her. Despite other constitutional amendments advancing on a bipartisan basis, every Republican in the legislature has voted against the reproductive rights one this year. 
While Spanberger has not served in Virginia’s state government, she has represented Virginians in Congress for three terms. There, she was part of an effort to repeal the Comstock Act, a dormant federal law that could be used to block the mailing of abortion pills and equipment used to sustain or establish clinics. State governments around the country have already tried to implement the law at the local level, but have been met with lawsuits or failed to advance it. 
Still, Democrats are eyeing the act closely because of its inclusion in Project 2025, a conservative playbook that includes some policies that are already being implemented in President Donald Trump’s current term.

 Elections and voting 

Spanberger said restoring voting rights to Virginians who have served their time would be a top priority if she wins in November, putting her at odds with Youngkin’s current approach.
The Republican governor rolled back his predecessors’ system of automatically restoring rights for people with felony convictions, instead reinstating a case-by-case review that has left many in limbo. Youngkin’s policy reversal has drawn criticism for lacking transparency and consistency, and Spanberger said she would immediately move to reverse course.
“I wholly support the restoration of rights,” she said in her interview with The Mercury. 
“People have basically just languished under this governor, and from the time I am sworn in, I will work to make sure that they, if they are eligible, get their rights restored, and not only do they get them restored, but that we actually communicate it to people so they know, and that there is much greater transparency.”
Spanberger also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would automatically restore voting rights after the completion of a sentence. 
“Getting the amendment passed is going to be important and that is something that I will campaign for,” she said.
On a separate voting issue, Spanberger said she would defer to a state commission now studying whether Virginia should end its off-year elections and shift to even years. She noted the potential for cost savings and increased turnout but said she’s glad Virginians will have a chance to vote this fall. “I support the commission,” she said.
 Housing policy 

Though local governments have most control over matters like zoning ordinances and approval of construction projects, increasingly, state lawmakers are weighing in on how they can help address affordability and supply issues. Spanberger said a top-down approach won’t work.
“I don’t want to mandate to a community ‘you have to say yes to this or you have to say no to this,’” Spanberger said in the interview. 
But she is interested in encouraging localities and state legislators to streamline approval of projects. An idea she suggested: land use developments that have housing components could receive expedited review, leading ultimately to more housing stock in markets. 
She also supports strengthening Virginia’s fair housing protections to prevent discrimination.
 Criminal justice and policing

Spanberger’s background working for the CIA undergirds her more police-friendly stance on some issues — a criticism from some branches of the Democratic party. 
After George Floyd’s murder in the summer of 2020 by a police officer, criminal justice reform advocacy and protests surged nationwide. When Democrats lost ground in congressional elections that fall, Spanberger had criticized further left-leaning members of her party for the “defund the police” rhetoric some had embraced. 
 “If we are classifying Tuesday as a success . . . we will get f—ing torn apart in 2022,” she had said in a call with other party members that was shared with The Washington Post. 
This year, she’s garnered the endorsement of a state police union that typically supports Republicans. A key factor, it said, was her successful law to remove caps on social security benefits for retirees like law enforcement officers while in Congress. 
Though opponent Earle-Sears has claimed Spanberger supported eliminating qualified immunity, Spanberger has not. She did sign onto a 2020 law with provisions to “reform,” not eliminate, the concept that protects officers from lawsuits while in the line of duty. Spanberger also proposed a 2021 bill to study how to incorporate community satisfaction into police performance measurements.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)The International Longshoremen’s Association is suing the Port of Virginia and its chief executive officer, Stephen Edwards, for allegedly violating the union’s master contract by forcing new rail crane technology on longshore workers. 
ILA believes that the implementation of new technology and automated equipment could threaten workforce protections, which the union said was a “contentious” matter before the contract was signed in March between ILA and Virginia International Terminals (VIT), responsible for administering the daily operations of the marine terminals at the Port of Virginia (VPA).
The association believes the Port authority and Edwards have overstepped their authority, using their influence to allegedly violate the union’s contract and federal labor laws.
“As the new Master Contract has gone into effect coastwide, the Port of Virginia has been the most resistant to complying with the new technology provisions when compared to every other port on the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States from Maine to Texas,” ILA stated in its lawsuit. “Again, the ILA and its affiliated local unions have been informed and believe that this resistance is being directed by defendant VPA, in general, and defendant Edwards, in particular.”
As an example of this dynamic, ILA’s lawsuit stated that in April 2025, members found newly purchased, semi-automated rail-mounted gantry cranes being set up and installed on the North Berth of the Norfolk International Terminal “without any prior notice” to the association, as required by the contract.
The association also stated that it has “repeatedly” raised concerns and filed contractual grievances against VIT regarding the contract violation. VIT has “consistently argued that it is unable to comply with its contractual obligations because “it is VPA—not VIT—that was purchasing, installing, and implementing of all new equipment” used to move containers efficiently with machine automation and human oversight. 
Some of the equipment included semi-automated stacking cranes, semi-automated cantilever Rail-Mounted Gantry (RMG) cranes, and semi-automated RMG cranes.
ILA, which is seeking a trial by jury, wants the court to determine if the actions by the Port authority and Edwards are illegal.
The association is also asking the court to prohibit the authority and Edwards from ever again interfering with its union contract or their negotiations, and from interfering with the grievance and dispute resolution procedures.
The association claims that the authority and Edwards violated the contract, which runs from October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2030. VPA created VIT because state law prohibits state agencies from working directly with labor unions on agreements about work conditions or worker pay.
VPA​ operates four general cargo facilities: Norfolk International Terminals, Portsmouth Marine Terminal, Newport News Marine Terminal and the Virginia​ Inland Port in Warren County. The VPA leases Virginia​ International Gateway and Richmond Marine Terminal. 
According to a recent economic impact study from The College of William and Mary, the Port of Virginia​ has helped to create approximately 565,000 full-time and part-time jobs, and generates more than $100 billion in total economic impact throughout the commonwealth on an annual basis. 
VPA has chosen not to comment on the case, and no court date has been scheduled yet.

But homeschooling recently saw another surge with about 53,000 homeschooled students during the 2023-24 school year, according to data from the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. 
The number of homeschooled students in Ohio, according to the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce: 

2023-24: 53,051 students 
2022-23: 47,468 students 
2021-22: 47,491 students
2020-21: 51,502 students
2019-20: 33,328 students
2018-19: 32,887 students
2017-18: 30,923 students

There were about 3.1 million home schooled students nationwide in 2021-22 — quite the jump from 2.5 million in spring 2019, according to the National Home Education Research Institute. 
“Home schooling was already on a slightly slower upward trajectory, and had been for a number of years,” said Douglas J. Pietersma, research associate at National Home Education Research Institute. “What COVID did, from our perspective, is just infused it.” 
He expects the number of home schooled students to keep growing. 
“It’s not going to put public schools out of business or anything like that, but it’s going to be a slow growth that is certainly going to be measurable over time,” Pietersma said. 
Remote learning during the pandemic made parents become more aware of what was being taught in schools, said Melanie Elsey, Christian Home Educators of Ohio’s legislative liaison. 
“I don’t think that it was a mass exodus from the public or private schools into homeschooling, but for parents who felt like they could accomplish more with one-on-one attention to learning … You can tailor the education to meet the needs of their children,” she said. 
Not everyone who switched to homeschooling stayed after the pandemic, Elsey said. 
“Some of them put their children back in because it was too much of a commitment,” she said. “So I think it was sort of a time period that parents felt comfortable trying something different to see if they could help their children learn more.” 
The modern home education movement sprung out of the 1970s and “skyrocketed” in the 1980s, Pietersma said. 
“People were either upset with the quality of education in general,” he said. “Then another group of people, it was more about the content of education.”
Today there are many reasons why a family might opt for homeschooling. 
“Obviously, the quality of education is still one of the big issues,” Pietersma said. “Safety issues are a huge thing. People who have had their children in schools where they’ve been bullied or assaulted or had exposure to drugs … given the size of school, it may be not impossible to prevent some of those things.”
The reason for homeschooling varies and it is not always because a family is not satisfied with their local school district, Elsey said. 
She homeschooled her children, but did not originally think it was for her family. However, she changed her mind after she enjoyed being home with her children through their preschool years. 
“We prayed about it and really felt like it was something that was worthwhile,” Elsey said. 
Jeannine Ramer has homeschooled her four children — two are now in college and two (ages 17 and 13) are currently being homeschooled. 
“Homeschooling has really strengthened our family relationships, my kids are very, very close and supportive of one another, and I think that’s all of the hours spent at home and just really learning together,” said Ramer, who lives in Alliance.
They were not initially planning on homeschooling their children, but Ramer’s sister-in-law homeschooled her children and encouraged them to think about it as their oldest approached preschool age. 
They decided to try it for a year or two, but found it worked well for their family. 
“We loved it,” Ramer said. “We’ve had the ability to tailor each child’s education to that child.”
A parent does not need to be a licensed teacher in order to homeschool their children, Elsey said. 
“It’s amazing how well families do because they have access to resources, really, all over the world, when you can get curriculum from anywhere that meets the needs of your students to learn to pursue their interests,” she said. 
Families who decide to homeschool their children enjoy the flexibility, Pietersma said. 
“They can tailor the education that they’re providing to their child in so many ways that an institutional school can’t just because of sheer numbers,” he said. “One teacher in a classroom with 30 students can’t take the lesson plan and tailor it to each of the 30 students.”
Ramer’s oldest child was interested in printing and design work as a teenager, so they were able to craft his high school education to those areas. Now he is studying industrial and innovative design in college. 
“It just allowed us the ability to foster that,” she said. “There was much more flexibility.”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)President Donald Trump on Monday downplayed the severity of domestic violence crimes, saying that were it not for “things that take place in the home they call crime,” the administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., would have resulted in a bigger statistical reduction in crime.
“They said, ‘Crime’s down 87 percent.’ I said, no, no, no — it’s more than 87 percent, virtually nothing. And much lesser things, things that take place in the home they call crime. You know, they’ll do anything they can to find something. If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime. See? So now I can’t claim 100 percent, but we are. We are a safe city,” Trump said.
The president’s comments were part of a speech he delivered at the Religious Liberty Commission’s meeting at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.
Domestic violence has long been recognized by the federal government as a national public health and safety crisis. A national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 in 10 women and 1 in 4 men have experienced physical or sexual violence or stalking by an intimate partner.
Next month marks the 25th annual Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which coincides with the 2000 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The law increased federal funding to combat domestic violence and other crimes that disproportionately affect women, recognizing the matter as a public health and safety issue, not a private domestic matter.
The federal government is by far the biggest source of funding for anti-domestic violence efforts, and since taking office, the Trump administration has sought to restrict nonprofits’ access to federal domestic violence grants. They have also laid off a top official and several teams working on the issue, threatening to destabilize domestic violence services and prevention efforts nationwide.
In a statement to The 19th, the White House said the president wasn’t “talking about or downplaying domestic violence.”
“President Trump’s Executive Order to address crime in DC even specifically took action against domestic violence,” said Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House. The order urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate housing providers who don’t comply with requirements to “restrict tenants who engage in criminal activity,” including domestic violence.
The White House also pointed out that the administration barred transgender women from women’s domestic abuse shelters, a move that advocates warn makes trans women less safe.
“While President Trump is making America safer, the Fake News is whipping up their latest hoax in real time to distract from the Administration’s tremendous results,” Jackson said.
Some groups focused on combating domestic violence criticized the president’s comments.
“The DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence believes that intimate partner violence is a crime and more than a ‘little fight with the wife’ as President Trump stated earlier today. Per federal and local statute, domestic violence is a crime and one that is not only a precursor to domestic violence homicides, but also a common factor in community violence, including mass shootings, where perpetrators often have a history of committing domestic violence,” said Dawn Dalton, the coalition’s executive director.
“By reducing domestic violence to a ‘little fight,’ President Trump revives a regressive view from an era when survivors were expected to endure abuse alone, without legal protections or public support, said Susanna Saul Director, Legal Programs at Her Justice, a nonprofit that provides free legal services to women living in poverty in New York City. “This does more than trivialize domestic abuse. It emboldens abusers to increase their violence and risks undoing decades of legal and cultural progress that have made safety a community responsibility, rather than a private burden.”
Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Wisconsin who has championed legislative efforts against domestic violence, said such crimes amount to “abuse that devastates families, endangers women and children, and takes lives every single day.”
“As a survivor of domestic violence, I found President Trump’s comments today downplaying domestic violence deeply offensive and disturbing,” she said in a statement. “Trump has a long history of violence against women that makes his dismissiveness unsurprising.”

As many states legalize sports betting, officials are increasingly eyeing a certain type of wager known as a prop bet for increased regulation. (Photo by Shannon Finney/Getty Images for MGM National Harbor)As a bankruptcy attorney, New Jersey Assemblymember Dan Hutchison said he sees clients “all the time” whose betting on football and baseball quickly leads to missed car payments, delinquent mortgages and, ultimately, bankruptcy.
The rise of live, in-game bets — in which a gambler could place more than 200 individual bets during a baseball game if they wager on each pitch thrown — has only amplified his misgivings.
“And I’m like, are you kidding me? I mean, they’re betting on the next pitch, the next play, and it’s constant,” he said. “There’s no pause. It’s just not healthy.”
Worried that those bets can worsen problem gambling and threaten the integrity of sports, Hutchison, a Democrat, introduced legislation to ban New Jersey gambling licensees from offering live bets on individual plays during sporting events.
That bill illustrates growing state interest in regulating proposition bets, commonly called prop bets, a form of sports betting that is popular with fans but worrisome for sports leagues and state officials nationwide.
Growth of sports betting may be linked to financial woes, new studies find

Unlike wagering on which team will win or the point spread of a game, prop bets can center on the performance of an individual player or even a single play that doesn’t necessarily affect the outcome of a contest. Prop bets can include trivia, such as the color of the Gatorade dumped over the Super Bowl’s winning coach, or specific stats, like how many touchdowns a certain quarterback will score during a game or which team will score first.
Critics say prop bets are easier for athletes to manipulate than the outcome of an entire game. They also make individual players more susceptible to online harassment from gamblers and increase the frequency of betting, thus raising the risk of addiction.
Ohio’s Republican governor has called for the nation’s first outright ban on prop betting on professional sports. Already, at least 15 states ban prop betting in collegiate sports, according to data maintained by the American Gaming Association, a trade group.
The heightened focus on prop bets comes amid a rapid rise of legal sports gambling, which is operational in 38 states and the District of Columbia. (Missouri plans to launch its new voter-approved program this December.) While legal betting has boosted state revenues and reshaped sports fandom, Hutchison said bankruptcy attorneys across the country are getting a preview of the financial wreckage it can wreak.
He said some clients are so distraught, he worries about potential suicides related to out-of-control gambling debts.
“That’s the reality of what’s going on. But they don’t make it seem like that when they’re doing these commercials during the football games: It’s normal, everybody does it, if you don’t do it, you’re not enjoying yourself,” he said. “That’s the glamour side of it. I deal with the other side.”
The industry’s rapid rise
The liberalization of sports gambling was made possible by a 2018 Supreme Court decision to strike down a federal law prohibiting gambling.
Since then, legal gambling has transformed the fan experience and propelled sportsbooks into major industry players: Americans are expected to wager an estimated $30 billion in legal sports betting on the NFL this season, according to the American Gaming Association. With so much money and energy flowing into gambling, academic researchers are increasingly raising concerns about the mental and financial consequences.
“The speed at which gambling has been marketed and legalized in this country is way faster than guardrails have been set to protect consumers and to try to give resources for problem gambling,” said Stephen Shapiro, a University of South Carolina professor who researches sports gambling.
Shapiro said a potential ban on prop betting in Ohio would prove a “big step” in gambling regulation. But he expects fierce opposition from the industry and consumers alike.
“They’re very popular. They’re arguably as — if not more — popular than betting on just individual games,” he said. “ … So I think there’ll be some backlash, but I also think over the next few years … there’s going to be an appetite for setting guardrails.”










The speed at which gambling has been marketed and legalized in this country is way faster than guardrails have been set.

The American Gaming Association, which represents casinos and sportsbooks, says that such restrictions would only drive gambling to illegal venues such as offshore betting platforms, where consumers have no protections.
But some sports leagues are ready for more restrictions on prop bets. The NCAA, the governing body for major college athletics, has been pushing federal and state leaders to ban prop betting in college sports.
The organization says 1 in 3 high-profile college athletes has received abusive messages from gamblers — the majority directed toward basketball players during tournament season. Just 12 days after North Carolina legalized sports betting last year — including prop bets on players — the University of North Carolina’s Armando Bacot reported receiving more than a hundred abusive social media messages for not accumulating enough rebounds in a game.
Women’s basketball student-athletes received about three times the number of threats as men’s basketball student-athletes, according to the NCAA.
In a March awareness campaign, NCAA President Charlie Baker said the abuse threatens the well-being of student-athletes and the overall environment of college sports.
“We need fans to do better,” he said in a statement at the time. “We need states to do better and ban player props that target student-athletes and enable detrimental abuse.”
And professional teams have their own concerns. Last month, ESPN reported the NBA and its players union supported further limits on certain prop bets. This summer, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters he would like to see some limits on prop bets.
“There are certain types of bets that strike me as unnecessary and particularly vulnerable,” Manfred said, according to Yahoo Sports.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine wants to ban prop bets after gambling allegations against Guardians players

In late July, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine called on state regulators to outright ban all prop bets — a request he asked the professional sports leagues to support.
DeWine’s proposal followed the suspensions of Cleveland Guardians’ pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase, who are being investigated by MLB. A sports betting integrity firm reportedly flagged two specific pitches Ortiz threw in early June that coincided with a pair of prop bets.
“The harm to athletes and the integrity of the game is clear, and the benefits are not worth the harm,” DeWine said in a July news release. “The prop betting experiment in this country has failed badly.”
The Ohio Casino Control Commission, which regulates sports betting, did not answer Stateline’s questions about the governor’s request. On Aug. 13, the agency said its investigation into the suspicious betting on the Guardians was ongoing.
In a statement responding to DeWine, the American Gaming Association said the Ohio incident is actually evidence that regulated gambling works: “It detects potential misconduct, it reports it, and it helps hold bad actors accountable,” said Joe Maloney, the association’s senior vice president of strategic communications.
In an interview, Maloney said eliminating legal prop betting will only move that activity into unregulated markets with no transparency. He said prop bets are a reflection of sports fandom: Bettors like to wager on their favorite players notching touchdowns or 3-pointers.
“It increases a fan’s engagement with the game they love, with the player they love. And so the idea that eliminating a legal betting market for someone really interested in increasing the level of engagement is going to prevent that activity, it’s just not the case,” Maloney said. “ … It simply will just move the activity into the shadows.”
Leagues endorse some limits
But the leagues are pushing for certain parts of the game to remain off-limits in legal betting markets.
Major League Soccer, for example, successfully pushed Illinois regulators last year to ban wagering on whether yellow and red penalty cards will be shown during a match and whether a specific player will receive a yellow or red card penalty.
Similarly, the state in February banned prop bets on NFL player injuries, player misconduct, officiating assignments, replay results and the first play of the game, following lobbying from the league.
Illinois Gaming Board spokesperson Beth Kaufman told Stateline the regulatory agency doesn’t maintain a list of specific prop bets that are allowed. But the board does require licensees to receive approval from the agency for specific wagers offered, she said.
“The IGB regularly monitors ongoing trends and developments in the industry and in major sports for any possible impact to the integrity of sports wagering in Illinois,” she said in a statement.
States Are Learning on the Fly About Sports Betting Addiction

The NFL has pushed for similar rule changes in other states.
During a late August news briefing on gambling, David Highhill, the league’s vice president for sports betting, said the NFL has consistently objected to certain bets that raise integrity risks and provide limited fan engagement. Those include bets about officiating or player injuries and bets that are controllable by a single player on a single play.
“So things like ‘will this kicker miss a field goal’ are things that we’ve worked collaboratively across the board with operators to make sure those types of wagers are not offered,” he said.
In New Jersey, Hutchison said he doesn’t want to ban all sports betting or even all prop bets. And he knows his bill targeting so-called micro bets — those live, play-by-play bets — will face opposition, both from the industry and sports gamblers.
An avid sports fan himself, he said he doesn’t waste his money gambling on his beloved Philadelphia Eagles: “They don’t build all of those casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas because they pay out winners,” he said.
He said he’s not looking to end legal sports betting, but does think New Jersey needs to instill consumer protections and have a meaningful policy conversation about the societal costs of gambling.
New Jersey lawmakers are also considering a separate bill to ban player-specific prop bets on college sports.
The Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey says it has experienced a nearly 300% increase in calls to its problem gambling hotline since the Garden State launched legal sports gambling in 2018.
In a July statement, Luis Del Orbe, executive director of the nonprofit council, which contracts with the state on gambling addiction issues, urged lawmakers to approve the bill to ban live, in-game bets. The organization says those high-frequency bets can trigger instant dopamine releases in the brain’s reward system, fostering compulsive behaviors that can lead to addiction.
“By limiting the proliferation of micro betting, this legislation takes an essential step toward protecting citizens from the harmful effects of reckless gambling practices,” Del Orbe’s statement said.

Wes Moore (D) makes it official, announcing Tuesday he will run for reelection, surprising no one; Moore's staff gets some new faces; and on the GOP side of the race, gubernatorial hopeful Ed Hale Sr. is, in fact, a Republican.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) in a 2023 file photo, delivering his first State of State address in the Maryland House of Delegates chamber. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) will make it official Tuesday when he announces his plans to seek re-election in 2026.
The announcement, which was widely expected, will be made in a campaign video in which Moore recounts his historic 2022 campaign, which made him the first Black governor in state history, as well as his efforts on crime, budgeting, taxes and the middle class since being elected.
“But while we stand up for middle-class Marylanders, the President of the United States is bending over backwards for billionaires and big corporations … firing federal workers, gutting Medicaid, raising prices on everything from electricity to groceries,” Moore said in a transcript of the video released to Maryland Matters. “The games of Washington are exhausting, and worse, they’re hurting people. I’m not from that world.”
The announcement comes two days after Moore repeated his insistence that he intends to serve a full term as governor and that he is not running for president in 2028 — a rumor that got fresh legs last week after paparazzi photographed Moore and his wife on a boat at the Italian villa of actor George Clooney, considered by some to be a Democratic kingmaker.
Moore, the incumbent and presumed Democratic primary frontrunner, becomes the second Democrat to announce his intentions for the governor’s mansion.
Ralph Jaffe, a retired teacher, filed for the primary race on July 30. Jaffe has run for governor or U.S. senator in eight previous elections, dating back to 1992. In 2022, he finished last in a 10-candidate Democratic primary field with 2,978 votes, about 0.44% of primary votes cast.
Meanwhile, on the second floor … 
Moore on Monday named Lester Davis as his new chief of staff, replacing the departing Fagan Harris.
“Lester is a known problem-solver, and his proven ability to secure improved outcomes for the people he serves will build on the progress our administration has made over the past two and a half years,” Moore said in a statement announcing the appointment. “He brings a commitment to building strong partnerships, uplifting communities, and delivering data-driven results that are in lockstep with the priorities our administration has championed since day one.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Davis joins the administration fresh off a three-year stint as vice president and chief of staff for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. He also served on transition teams for Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.
While in Baltimore, he spent roughly a decade working for Jack Young, first as director of policy and communications for then-City Council President Young and later as deputy chief of staff when Young became mayor after Catherine Pugh resigned while under investigation for fraud related to her “Healthy Holly” books.
Davis holds a bachelor’s degree in print journalism from Norfolk State University and worked roughly four years as a reporter at various publications including the Palm Beach Post. He will start this fall as part of a planned transition. A Moore spokesperson could not immediately provide Davis’ planned salary.
Harris, Moore’s current chief of staff, announced last month that he would leave by the end of the year to become president and CEO of the Abell Foundation, a Baltimore philanthropic institution.
Moore’s lobby shop staffs up
The governor’s office also added two new deputies in his legislative office.
Tony Bridges moves to the lobbying shop after three years as assistant secretary for equity and engagement at the Maryland Department of Transportation. The former Baltimore City delegate held a number of positions with the Transportation Department, including chief of staff at the Maryland Transit Administration.
Also joining the shop is Hannah Dier, who held a number of positions including, most recently, deputy county administrative officer under Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman. Prior to her stint in Anne Arundel County, Dier served six years as a budget analyst in the Department of Legislative Services. Her last three were as senior policy analyst for the House Appropriations Committee.
Bridges and Dier round out a team of seven deputies under Chief Legislative Officer Jeremy Baker. Baker once advised two House speakers overlapping with the service of Bridges and Dier.
Turns out, Hale is a Republican (now)
Ed Hale, who announced he was leaving the Democratic party to run for governor as a Republican, faced more criticism last week regarding his decision to switch rather than fight Moore for the Democratic Party nomination.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey (R-Upper Shore), who announced last week that he was exploring his own run for governor, claimed in an interview that Hale had not yet switched parties.

“He might think he’s a conservative person, he might run businesses, which we do understand, but the fact of the matter is, he’s a Democrat and he’s still a Democrat,” Hershey said in a televised interview Thursday. “I was at the Board of Elections today, Ed Hill has not changed party affiliation yet.”
Turns out, he had.
Hale, a lifelong Democrat, announced Aug. 21 he was switching parties to run for governor as a Republican. A day later, he said during a radio interview he had filed the paperwork to make it official.
After Hershey’s interview, Hale shared with Maryland Matters a photo of an updated voter registration card from Talbot County, where he lives. Dated Aug. 22, it shows Hale registered as a Republican. Maryland Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis Monday confirmed that Hale had switched parties Aug. 22 in Talbot County and was issued an updated voter registration card.
“Why is he making fun of me,” Hale wrote in a text to a reporter. “Seems disingenuous.”
Hershey did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Hershey has been highly critical of Hale’s party switch, calling the Baltimore businessman a political opportunist and a newly minted Republican of “convenience rather than conviction.” It seems unlikely Hershey is going to drop the issue any time soon: During the Fox 45 interview, he made it clear if he enters the race for governor, Hale’s party switch will be campaign fodder.
“I don’t know what makes him think he can come into our party after years and years and years being a lifelong Democrat and saying at the last minute, I’m going to be a Republican and therefore embrace me,” Hershey said. “Right now, Ed Hale is looking for a party … someone to welcome him. I don’t think that the Republican Party welcomes him, but that will be a campaign issue, and if that’s what we have to talk about, I certainly welcome the opportunity to run against a Democrat in the Republican primary.”
Hale is not yet an official candidate, according to a check of the Maryland State Board of Elections website Monday night.

Photo credit: Georgia House of Representatives and Ross Williams with the Georgia RecorderThe upcoming race for governor won’t be the only wide-open constitutional office on the ballot next year. 
In addition to choosing Georgia’s next chief executive, lieutenant governor (and possibly Secretary of State), voters will also be selecting the state’s next attorney general. It’s just the latest in a game of political musical chairs playing out at the state Ccapitol as Gov. Brian Kemp enters his final year in office.
Incumbent attorney general Chris Carr, a Republican, is one of many candidates hoping to take a seat in the governor’s chair as the sun sets on Kemp’s two-term tenure, leading to an open race to become Georgia’s chief litigator.
Democrats are hoping that the lack of an incumbent, along with Georgia’s shifting political terrain, put this race in play. Republicans, meanwhile, are hoping to maintain a nearly two-decade-long grip on Georgia’s executive offices.
Republicans appear to be locked in a competitive primary between two prominent state senators, while Democrats are set to choose between two candidates who have served in the state House, including one currently.
State Sen. Bill Cowsert was the first Republican to join the contest. An Athens Republican, Cowsert is the longest-serving member of his caucus and once served as the chamber’s majority leader. He will quickly tout himself as the candidate with the most experience, saying he has spent more time in courtrooms than all of his opponents combined.
He also helped lead the state Senate’s scrutiny of Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who made national headlines for charging then-former President Donald Trump and more than a dozen of his allies for their roles in trying to overturn the 2020 election. The case has been stalled after defense attorneys uncovered her romantic relationship with the lead prosecutor, which led a top court to sever her office from the case entirely.
Cowsert also leaned into public safety, with an important emphasis on his hometown, which was the scene of the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley on the campus of the University of Georgia last February at the hands of a Venezuelan migrant.
“When Laken Riley was murdered last year, it rocked [Athens],” he said during a brief interview. “And when it became apparent that Athens is a sanctuary city and made declarations that were very welcoming to illegal immigrants, it’s very much becoming a public safety issue.” 
His opponent in the primary, state Sen. Brian Strickland, is striking a similar tone of fighting crime and defending conservative values. The McDonough attorney and former state representative chairs the Senate’s powerful judiciary committee, which deals with legal and judicial issues.
Strickland said he would welcome an endorsement from President Donald Trump, who has acted as a kingmaker in Republican politics since his first run for the White House a decade ago.
“I’ll take a Trump endorsement,” he said during an interview with Atlanta’s 11Alive News. “I think I’m someone that lines up with his views. And I’m someone that will fight for the values of Georgia. I’ll take those fights I’ve had at the statehouse across the street to the courthouse.”
Democrats, meanwhile, are seeking to win the attorney general post for the first time since 2006. Two state lawmakers, one current and one former, believe they have what it takes to break Republicans’ two-decade-long hold on the office.
What started off as a seemingly quiet race suddenly raised a few eyebrows last month when State Rep. Tanya Miller announced her bid. A Democrat from Atlanta, Miller’s legal career began in New York as a federal prosecutor before relocating to Georgia to work in the Fulton County District Attorney’s office. Only in her second term as a legislator, she has already risen to the No. 3 spot in the House Democratic Caucus, where she has been a vociferous critic of Kemp’s litigation overhaul and many of his legislative priorities.
With Republicans already attacking Democrats as obstructionists who only want to go toe-to-toe with Trump for political points, Miller is pledging to put politics aside. 
“In all my years of being a prosecutor, I’ve never asked a victim whether they were a Republican or a Democrat. I’ve never asked the accused whether they were a Republican or a Democrat. Your job is to represent the people – all people. And it’s unfortunate that in this political process, the [attorney general’s] office is being politicized.”
Former state Rep. Bob Trammell, who served as House minority leader and who is now Miller’s opponent in the Democratic primary, is also distancing himself from Republican attacks. Hailing from a small Meriwether County community called Luthersville, Trammell was the first Democrat to formally enter the contest and believes that the description of the job he is running for can only be summed up in two words: “protect Georgians.”
“If the attorney general is literally waiting on instructions from the White House on what to do and what not to do, who is the client in that situation? Is the client Georgians whom you are charged constitutionally with protecting, or is your client the political occupant of the White House?” Trammell said. 
With contested primaries in both parties, the attorney general’s race is already one of the marquee races on the ballot next year. But in a state where Republicans have dominated down-ballot contests for most of this century, it’s Democrats who need to convince voters that now is the time to end two decades of GOP leadership at the state level.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/agcandidatescropped-1-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-09-09 05:57:50.148047

(Photo by Jackyenjoyphotography/Getty Images)Lawmakers on both the federal and state levels have spent much of 2025 workshopping and debating changes and cuts to Medicaid, the nation’s public health care program for people with low incomes or unique needs.
The Republicans behind the changes have looked to the program for cost-savings and claimed they’re just trying to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. Democrats, on the other hand, have decried the cuts as cruel and argued their sole purpose is to fund tax cuts for the ultra wealthy. In the end, Republicans, who control both Congress in Washington and the state Legislature in Concord, succeeded on most counts in enacting their desired changes to the program.
From work requirements to premiums, here’s a look at where lawmakers landed and what that means for New Hampshire’s health care landscape.
Work requirements
Both Congress and the New Hampshire Legislature enacted plans to implement work requirements for Medicaid enrollees this year.
When the Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a new budget in late June, it also kickstarted the state’s work requirement system. In addition to funding the state government, the budget legislation instructs the state Department of Health and Human Services to devise a work requirement system for Medicaid and submit it to the federal government. Because Medicaid is a program run jointly by the state and federal governments, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must approve changes through what is known as a demonstration waiver. The details of that work requirement plan need to be approved by New Hampshire’s Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee before being sent to the federal government.
In arguing for work requirements on the Senate floor in March, state Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican, argued “Medicaid and other welfare programs should be a bridge for non-aged, non-disabled adults, not a destination.” He and his Republican colleagues framed the work requirements as a way to encourage employment and help people get jobs.
However, research compiled by the Brookings Institution and other research organizations suggests work requirements for Medicaid and other social programs don’t increase employment and often strip benefits from eligible people due to the burdensome bureaucracy necessary to administer the requirements.
Before the work requirement plan was added to the budget bill, it was part of a standalone piece of legislation. That legislation failed, but its provisions were incorporated into the budget as a nongermane amendment.
And then the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed Congress. The behemoth omnibus bill, which had been in the works for months and was signed into law in July, has been the signature legislation of President Donald Trump’s second term in office so far. Among the hundreds of provisions in the law is a work requirement system for Medicaid. The law mandates able-bodied Medicaid enrollees work 80 hours a month or lose coverage.
It is unclear how the federal work requirements will interact with the state-level requirements. Kathy Remillard, deputy director of communications for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said in an email to the Bulletin: “The Department is reviewing the new federal and state work requirements language to ensure program changes comply with state and federal law. We are working with the Governor’s office and the Legislature to identify differences and determine next steps.”
Federal cuts
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act affects Medicaid in New Hampshire in several ways.
It eliminates some financing that the federal government has been providing to states since 2010 for the expansion of Medicaid. It restricts states from using special funding — known as state-directed payments — to pay Medicaid providers higher rates than Medicare. It also limits retroactive payments, requires enrollees to prove their eligibility every six months instead of yearly, and freezes states’ ability to charge Medicaid providers taxes, among other changes. In all, it’s expected to revoke roughly 15% of New Hampshire’s federal baseline Medicaid spending through these and other provisions, according to analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
KFF’s analysis also estimates the bill will result in between 17,000 and 29,000 people in New Hampshire losing health care coverage by 2034. Nationwide, the foundation estimates roughly 10 million will lose coverage.
Premiums and increased copays
Back at the state level, New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte entered office in January with a series of fiscal priorities. One was to save money on Medicaid. To do that, she proposed a number of changes to the program in New Hampshire.
The most significant of those was to introduce premiums for some enrollees. Ayotte proposed that families that earn at least 255% of the federal poverty level (or 100% and up for those without children) be required to make a payment of up to 5% of their household income in order to receive coverage.
For reference, a family of three earning 255% of the federal poverty level would be bringing in an annual salary of $59,962.50, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Ayotte proposed these premiums as part of the budget. However, when the Legislature got its turn to work on the budget, lawmakers altered it to be a fixed price based on the size of a family rather than a share of the income.
In the final version that was signed into law, enrollees making 100% of the poverty line or more will pay between $60 to $100 per month, depending on the size of their families; enrollees making at least 255% of the poverty line will pay $190 to $270 monthly.
The family of three earning $59,962.50 is set to pay $233 a month, based on 2025’s poverty level guidelines. A family of three earning $26,650 is set to pay $90 a month.
In an interview at the time, Ayotte defended these premiums by pointing out how broad New Hampshire’s eligibility requirements are compared to other states.
“New Hampshire has among the highest eligibility in terms of who’s covered for Medicaid in the nation,” she said. “People aren’t even eligible to get Medicaid above 255% of poverty in 26 states.”
Indeed, as of January, the most recent data available, New Hampshire ranks fourth (tied with Connecticut) among U.S. states and territories for most expansive Medicaid income eligibility requirements for children, according to KFF.
Democrats lambasted the premiums, likening them to an “income tax on the poor.”
The legislation instructs DHHS to devise a plan to implement the premiums by July 2026
Ayotte also looked for cost savings in copays, the portion of prescriptions that enrollees are responsible for. The budget legislation changes the amount Medicaid recipients pay for their prescriptions from $1 or $2 to $4 per prescription (unless that exceeds 5% of household income).
The new copays go into effect in January 2026.
Name-brand drugs
Another of Ayotte’s cost-saving measures, unlike the premiums or copays, saw bipartisan support.
New Hampshire’s Medicaid program has long been prohibited from buying name-brand drugs when a generic version is available because historically the name brands are more expensive. However, in recent years, some name-brand drugs have become cheaper than their generic counterparts, so lawmakers altered that rule this year. With the enactment of the new budget, New Hampshire Medicaid is allowed to purchase name-brand drugs if they’re cheaper than the generic.
Jake Leon, DHHS director of communications, told the Bulletin the state won’t know how much money is being saved until the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of the fiscal year (the second quarter closes at the end of December). However, Leon said the department budgeted savings of just under $1 million in the fiscal year that started in July and just under $3 million in the year after that.
The trigger law
A big fear among Democrats and Medicaid proponents in New Hampshire has revolved around the state’s 2018 trigger law.
In 2014, New Hampshire expanded Medicaid using funding provided by the federal government through the Affordable Care Act. Today, roughly 60,000 New Hampshire residents are able to receive Medicaid through that expansion, which is funded 90% by the federal government. (Roughly 186,000 people are on Medicaid in New Hampshire in total.) In 2018, however, New Hampshire passed a law that would revoke Medicaid from these 60,000 people under the expanded eligibility if the federal funding falls below 90% of the cost of the program. (Previous laws had also set triggers but at different thresholds.)
As Republicans in Washington debated cuts to Medicaid, many in New Hampshire, particularly Democrats and those working in Medicaid, feared this so-called trigger law would be activated.
In order for the trigger law to be activated, the federal government would’ve had to reduce its share of the cost of that expansion below 90%, which it has been contributing to states that opt in since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. That hasn’t happened so far with this round of Medicaid cuts.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/medicaidcutshospital-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 05:57:50.148047

Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.
The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.
Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.
While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.
“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”
According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.
In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.
Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.
Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.
The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.
In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.
Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.
But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.
Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.
“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.” 
In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.
While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.
“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects. 
In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.
One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.
“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.” 
In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.
Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections. 
However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.
“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.
Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.
Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)
“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”
Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.
Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.
Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.
Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output. 
A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.
Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.
“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.
At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.
State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.
Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.
“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”
Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.
While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.
“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”
Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 05:57:50.148047

The survey ranked 257 colleges and universities after receiving responses from more than 68,000 students who were surveyed via College Pulse from Jan. 3 through June 5. 13 Ohio colleges and universities were ranked between No. 49 and 224, and the state’s average speech climate grade is an F, which matches the national average. 
This is the sixth consecutive year FIRE has done this survey, which now gives universities letter grades. A majority of universities surveyed — 166 out of 257 — received a failing grade for their campus speech climate. 
To come up with an overall score for each college, FIRE summed 12 components: comfort expressing ideas, self-censorship, disruptive conduct, administrative support, openness, political tolerance, the Chicago statement, institutional neutrality, FIRE’s spotlight rating and various speech controversies on campus. 
Claremont McKenna College in California received the highest ranking with an overall score of 79.86 and B- grade. Barnard College in New York City was the lowest ranked with an overall score of 40.74 and an F grade. 
Here’s where Ohio colleges and universities ranked on FIRE’s list:
49. Wright State University — 63.32 overall score, D climate grade and 275 students surveyed. 
64. Ohio University —  61.47 overall score, D- climate grade and 371 students surveyed.

Kent State had the biggest negative change and was ranked No. 113 on last year’s survey. 
“Kent State’s decline is the result of students reporting a considerably higher amount of self-censorship and comfort expressing political views,” said Sean Stevens, FIRE’s Chief Research Advisor. 
Statewide, Ohio received failing marks on censorship, administrative support and political tolerance, according to the survey. Ohio earned a C+ on disruptive conduct, a C- on openness and a D on comfort expressing ideas, according to the survey.
A third of Ohio students said using violence to prevent someone from speaking on campus is acceptable in some rare cases, according to the survey. 
Nearly three-fourths of Ohio students said shouting down a speaker to prevent them from speaking is acceptable in some rare cases and 44% of Ohio said they have self-censored on campus at least once or twice a month, according to the survey.

Here is what you need to know.
Tens of thousands of voters in 193 precincts across six Cleveland-area municipalities have choices to make Sept. 9. Already, more than one thousand have voted.
For each candidate race, the top two vote-getting candidates will advance from Tuesday to the general election on Nov. 4.
Cuyahoga County is the only county in the state to have a September primary. All races are designated as nonpartisan. The (i) after someone’s name means they are the incumbent.
The ballot
City Council
Cleveland City Council wards 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 12 all have seats up.
The districts are shrinking from 17 wards to 15, so incumbents may now be combined into one district.
Seat 1: Juanita O. Brent, Aylwin S. Bridges, Marc G. Crosby, Joe Jones (i), Lesa Jones Dollar
Seat 3: Deborah A. Gray (i), Sharon M. Spruill, Erich V. Stubbs
Seat 5: Rebecca Maurer (i), Beverly Owens-Jackson, Richard A. Starr (i)
Seat 7: Austin N. Davis, Mohammad Faraj, Mike Roglaski
Seat 8: Stephanie Howse-Jones (i), Leon Meredith, Charlotte Perkins, Tony Perry (Write-In), Teri Ying-Liang Wang
Seat 9: Alana Belle, Kevin Conwell (i), Tony Evans, Jr.
Seat 12: Andrew DeFratis, Danny Kelly (i), Tanmay Shah
“The reason why there are so many Cleveland wards that are not in the election is because the field of candidates is already two people,” Cuyahoga County Board of Elections’ Mike West said.
Maple Heights City Council has District 7 up.
Seat 7: Edwina K. Agee (i), Travian M. Atkins, Samantha C. Scales
Mayoral
Mayoral races are being held in East Cleveland, Garfield Heights and Cleveland Heights.
East Cleveland: Juanita Gowdy, Sandra Morgan, Vidah Aminah Saeed, Lateek R. Shabazz (i), Sean L. Ward
Both Sandra Morgan and Lateek Shabazz acted as mayor at some point during 2025 after former Mayor Brandon King was convicted of corruption. However, a court decided that Shabazz is the rightful mayor.
Garfield Heights: Matt Burke (i), James S. Feeney, Cathy Mack
Cleveland Heights: Deanna Bremer Fisher, Marty Gelfand, Laura Kinsley Hong, Jim Petras, Davida Russell
Recall
Current Cleveland Heights Mayor Khalil Seren isn’t up for reelection; however, voters are being asked whether to recall him, removing him from office.
The recall comes as Seren has been under the microscope of scrutiny for months, stemming from a civil rights complaint regarding his wife, a discrimination lawsuit, a delayed budget 2025 budget process and high staff turnover.
“This is important because we have zero confidence in Mayor Seren’s ability or willingness to conduct city business, lead City Hall, or execute the mayor’s duties in accordance with the city charter. Each day that he holds office, the city of Cleveland Heights continues to be put at risk and harmed,” one of the recall organizers, Josie Moore, told News 5.
Although residents submitted more than 4,000 signatures to get his removal on the ballot, not everyone agrees.
“He has to devote all his time and energy to making sure all his projects are ready to hand off to the next mayor. That’s going to take a lot of work and if he’s fighting a recall at the same time, that’s going to really distract him,” Drew Herzig said. “Their claim is that every day he spends in office does irreparable damage to the city, which is ridiculous. I mean, they started a fire. They poured gasoline on it, and now they’re blaming the mayor for the smoke. I think this is ill conceived and it will do damage to the city if they can move forward with it.”
Liquor issues
Cleveland Ward 7, Precinct J has the option to allow SoHo Chicken + Whiskey to sell alcohol on Sundays.
Lakewood Ward 1, Precinct B has the option of allowing Rood Food and Pie to sell alcohol on Sundays.

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)In 1979, I bought my first parcel of farmland. It was near Tribune, and I was a proud new landowner. As I recall, the purchase price was $350 per acre. Today, that land is probably worth somewhere in the $2,000-per-acre range. That mirrors trends in farmland values in other parts of the United States.
In the years since that initial purchase, I have seen many changes in the agricultural sector. They include a decline in planted wheat acres in Kansas from about 12.1 million in 1979 to 7.6 million for the 2024 crop (according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service). Corn, soybeans and milo have filled much of the gap. Other examples are the decline in the number of farms from about 75,000 in 1980 to about 55,500 in 2024.
Macro trends that have affected U.S. agriculture in the past two decades include the following:

The advent of large-scale corn-based ethanol production, which went from virtually nothing to over 5 billion bushels of corn used for that purpose by 2021.
Greater use of technology in the forms of improved varieties of seeds, precision application of crop inputs and crop monitoring from the sky.
The addition of about 398 million acres of cropland since the turn of this century, notably in Brazil and India, but also in other regions.
Declining population growth trends in major importers of U.S. crops, especially China.

For me, the backdrop for all of these trends is my experience going through the farm crisis of the 1980s. Some of those memories will stay with me for all of my life. When I think about the current status of agriculture in America, and especially in Kansas, I have deep concerns. The health of the Kansas economy is highly dependent on the viability of the farm sector, and I see a combination of factors — the likes of which we have not faced in my lifetime — that are disturbing.
The chaos of the Trump administration is undermining agriculture in Kansas and across the nation. We are seeing traditional importers of U.S. grains, notably China, go elsewhere. The tariffs imposed by our government are doing far more harm than good for farmers who are being hit hard on the cost side of the equation.
Take your pick — wheat, corn, soybeans, milo — not a single crop shows a positive cash flow. That’s before considering the opportunity cost of the capital used for the inputs, let alone any land debt service. When I refer to opportunity cost, I simply mean that that same capital could be invested in a safe financial instrument, such as a CD, where it would earn interest at a rate above 4% annually.
In recent weeks, I have spoken with bankers in Kansas and nearby states that have heavy concentrations of agricultural loans. All of them told me that they are dreading “renewal season,” which is the time when farmers renew operating loans for the 2026 season. There will be some very difficult conversations, because in some instances the farmer borrower will have little choice but to sell some land to improve his or her financial situation.
Other borrowers will see unpaid balances on this year’s operating loans termed out in the hopes that, over time, they can be repaid. In other words, the can will be kicked down the road. Land equity does not pay the fertilizer bill; it takes cash flow to do that.
All of this raises the question: What will happen to farmland values?
In the past decade, it seemed few things could get in the way of increases. A significant amount of outside capital was invested in farmland. The land was sometimes referred to by investors as gold with a coupon. While farmers continue to be the primary buyers, there is no doubt that this outside capital provided some support for land values. That capital is now looking at less-volatile assets.
I have had conversations with investors who have put hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. farmland. Their mood now reflects the concerns that investors have when uncertainties come into the picture. Those uncertainties are in large part the result of the Trump chaos factor.
Recently, I was approached by a farmer who wanted me to team up with him to buy some land to expand his operation. He and I share the same emotional attachment to the land that is a cornerstone value for most farmers. But both he and I are struggling with buying an asset in a market that is headed one way — south. When you cut through all of the chatter, there is one word that defines the agriculture sector today.
That word, whether in Kansas or South Carolina, is unsustainable.  
 All of this has big consequences for the small towns that undergird Kansas. When farmers tighten their belts, fewer dollars flow into those communities, and that only hastens the depopulation so apparent in many areas of the Great Plains. A way of life is at risk. If the current administration has its way, America will be remade into an island, isolated from the rest of the world. That is not a viable business or social strategy.
The result is that our competitors will gladly fill the void. They are already doing so.
Some observers have suggested that the current situation in U.S. agriculture is different than in the ’80s. That is true in respect to interest rates. There are also fundamental factors at work not present in the 80s. They include the items that I have noted above, along with a troubling trend towards isolationism. Kansas farmers and their peers produce way more grain than can ever be consumed in the United States in a given year. Without reliable export markets, the results cannot be good.
I have heard all of the arguments in favor of higher land values, such as: “They aren’t making any more of it, “Everything will work out” and so forth. Folks, things are not going to work out if the present approach continues. And, yes, as noted above, “they” are adding more land in other countries.
I love the land, and I have great admiration for those who produce our food and fiber. For all of us who are in the ag sector, silence is not an option in light of the fact that we have a looming crisis on our hands. Inaction will have serious consequences on land values for Kansas farmers as well for the state as a whole.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tractor-e1757392127730-1024x604.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 04:56:31.903543

The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the country’s founding document, in 2026. Twenty years later, America will celebrate the 250th anniversary of President George Washington’s Farewell Address, which was published on Sept. 19, 1796.
The two documents are the bookends of the American Revolution. That revolution began with the inspirational language of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote much of the Declaration of Independence; it ended with somber warnings from Washington, the nation’s first president.
After chairing the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and serving eight years as president, Washington announced in a newspaper essay that he would not seek another term and would return to his home in Mount Vernon. The essay was later known as the “Farewell Address.”
Washington began his essay by observing that “choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene” while “patriotism does not forbid it.” The new nation would be fine without his continued service.
But Washington’s confidence in the general health of the union was tempered by his worries about dangers that lay ahead – worries that seem startlingly contemporary and relevant 229 years later.
 Focus on the domestic

Washington’s Farewell Address is famous for the admonitions “to steer clear of permanent alliances” and to resist the temptation to “entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition.”
Important as those warnings are, they are not the main topic of Washington’s message.
During the four decades that I have taught the Farewell Address in classes on American government, I have urged my students to set aside the familiar issues of foreign policy and isolationism and to read the address for what it says about the domestic challenges confronting America.
Those challenges included partisanship, parochialism, excessive public debt, ambitious leaders who could come to power playing off our differences, and a poorly informed public who might sacrifice their own liberties to find relief from divisive politics.
Washington’s address lacks Jefferson’s idealism about equality and inalienable rights. Instead, it offers the realistic assessment that Americans are sometimes foolish and make costly political mistakes.
 Rule by ‘ambitious, and unprincipled men’

Partisanship is the primary problem for the American republic, according to Washington.
“It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration,” he wrote. Partisanship “agitates the community with ill founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection” and can open “the door to foreign influence and corruption.”
Though political parties, Washington observes, “may now and then answer popular ends,” they can also become “potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.”
Washington’s fear that partisanship could lead to destruction of the Constitution and to the rule of “ambitious, and unprincipled men” was so important to him that he felt compelled to repeat the warning more than once in the Farewell Address.
 Politicians’ ‘elevation on the ruins of public liberty’

The second time Washington takes it up, he says that “the disorders and miseries” of partisanship may “gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual.”
Sooner or later, he writes, “the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.”
So why not outlaw parties and rein in the dangers of partisanship?
Washington observes that this is not possible. The spirit of party “is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind.”
Americans naturally collect themselves into groups, factions, interests and parties because that’s what human beings do. It’s easier to be connected to local communities, states or regions of the country than to a large and diverse nation; even though that large and diverse nation is, by Washington’s assessment, essential to the security and success of all.
The central problem in American politics is not a matter of devious leaders, foreign intrigue or sectional rivalries — things that will always exist.
The problem, Washington warned, lies with the people.
 Excesses of partisanship

By their nature, people divide themselves into groups and then, if not careful, find those divisions used and abused by individual leaders, foreign interests and “artful and enterprising” minorities.
Political parties are dangerous, but can’t be eliminated. According to some people, Washington observes, the competition between parties might serve as a check on the powers of government.
“Within certain limits,” Washington acknowledges, “this is probably true.” But even if the battles between political parties sometimes have a useful purpose, Washington worried about the excesses of partisanship.
Partisanship is like “a fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume.”
Where is America today? Warmed by the fires of partisanship or consumed by the bursting of flames? George Washington suggested that provocative question more than two centuries ago on Sept. 19, 1796. It’s still worth asking.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)As Maine students return to campuses and schools against a backdrop of changing federal laws, increasing immigration enforcement and national scrutiny of the state’s inclusive policies, local rights groups partnered to release a guide to ensure students know their rights.
The guide, published by ACLU, Equality Maine and national legal advocacy group GLAD law,  includes advice for families and schools on keeping students safe. It explains what rights groups of marginalized students — including immigrant, LGBTQ+ and unhoused students — have on campus, what they can do to request support from schools and under what circumstances educational institutions have to comply with law enforcement. 
“Throughout the country and right here in Maine, politicians, school boards, and others have made clear their commitment to banning books, censoring classroom discussions, and curtailing other constitutional rights,” said ACLU of Maine Legal Director Carol Garvan in a statement.
“These efforts undermine a central purpose of our education system: to expose students to a diversity of ideas and prepare them to live in our multicultural democracy.”
Rights of LGBTQ+ students
Despite several attempts at the state level this year, Maine’s protections for transgender students remain intact as enshrined in the Maine Human Rights Act. 
“Despite the overreach by the federal government recently, the Maine Human Rights Act is still the law in Maine, which aims to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination in schools. Every student has the right to a safe learning environment,” said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine. 
That means students are guaranteed legal protections that go beyond general anti-discrimination policies. State law also requires public schools to ensure students are not discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and obligates districts to adopt policies that actively prevent bullying and harassment. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Maine Department of Education also has issued guidance on model policies for LGBTQ+ students, reminding districts that they are required to follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which continues to protect trans students’ rights to access affirming facilities at school. 
The document explains that this means Maine students have the right to use restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity, to be addressed by their chosen name and pronouns, and to participate in school activities — including sports — in line with their gender identity. They also have the right to express themselves through clothing and other personal choices without fear of punishment or harassment.
Advocates stress that these rights are backed not only by Maine’s Human Rights Act but also by federal law, including Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.
Immigrant students’ rights
Despite the uptick in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, the guide emphasizes that federal law requires that all students — regardless of immigration status — have access to free public education. Schools cannot deny enrollment based on citizenship or demand proof of immigration status. 
Under Maine’s Human Rights Act, protections in school also extend to bullying and harassment tied to one’s national origin or family background. Schools are also required to provide instruction and support for English language learners, and aren’t allowed to exclude them from classes.
Federal privacy laws also forbid school staff from sharing student education records with outside agencies without parental consent or a court order. That means immigration officials, including ICE, cannot simply request records or student information from schools. 
Some school districts with large immigrant populations, such as Lewiston or Brunswick, issued letters and guidance to families in January, establishing protocols for staff members if ICE agents show up on campuses. 
To protect students, the ACLU says all schools should adopt policies that require legal review before responding to subpoenas or information requests. Neither the Maine Department of Education nor the Maine School Superintendents Association track district-level policies, but Maine superintendents “are committed to creating schools that are safe, welcoming, and centered on every student’s success,” association President Eileen King in a statement.
Families can opt out of allowing directory information — such as a student’s name or address — to be shared, closing off another potential avenue for outside access.
In the event that a parent is detained, the guide instructs schools to rely on emergency contact forms provided by the family, not immigration authorities, when determining who can pick up a child. The guide encourages families to update those contacts regularly to ensure continuity of care.
By spelling out these protections, the ACLU underscores that schools are not enforcement arms of federal immigration agencies and have a responsibility to safeguard students’ privacy and access to education.
Book bans and access to education
The document also addresses the increase in efforts nationwide to challenge access to books, although this has not been a widespread issue in Maine schools. 
The document still warns against a national wave of efforts to restrict access to materials that deal with race, gender identity and sexuality, as most banned or challenged books are about marginalized communities.
According to the guide, students have a constitutional right to receive information and ideas, a protection the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized for decades. That means public schools and libraries cannot remove books simply because they contain unpopular viewpoints or because some parents object to their content.
While schools do have discretion in developing curricula, and Maine stresses local control, meaning the state allows districts to choose what to teach and what books to use, the guide notes that removing library books for political or ideological reasons violates the First Amendment. All students, the guide notes, are entitled to a library that reflects a wide range of perspectives and experiences.
The document also encourages students who encounter book removals to document what happened, raise concerns with administrators, and, if necessary, seek legal support. 
“Access to information is a cornerstone of education,” the guide states. “When schools start pulling books, it’s not just about one title—it’s about silencing ideas.”

(Getty Images)My daughter Freya Grace was perfect. Five pounds, fourteen ounces, twenty inches long. Her eyelashes, her tiny fingers and toes, the peach fuzz on her back, I’ve memorized every detail. We went into the hospital at 39 weeks, bags packed, ready to bring home our healthy baby girl.
Instead, we left with empty arms and a broken future. When the nurse couldn’t find her heartbeat, I was naïve enough to show her where Freya’s feet were, where her little tushy always pressed against my belly. I thought surely they just needed a better machine.
In that hospital room, as reality set in, the doctors and nurses also were shocked. I could see the heartbreak on their faces. They had followed the guidelines they were given, caring for us with kindness and attention. But those guidelines weren’t enough.
At 36 weeks, Freya’s growth was slowing down, but they told us she would stay above 10th percentile, the cutoff where they start to worry about stillbirth. No one explained what that meant for her survival or prepared us for any danger ahead. The word stillbirth never entered the conversation.
After she was gone, we learned her placenta was “small and old.” Our past ultrasounds and growth scans had measured Freya’s size and the placenta’s location, but not the placenta’s size or function. The pathology report showed her placenta percentile was .060%. Freya was trying to survive on a failing organ, and we had no idea.
Half of stillbirths are linked to placental issues. Yet we don’t routinely monitor the placenta’s size or health in this country. There are tools, like Estimated Placental Volume scans, that could save babies like Freya, but they aren’t standard practice.
It’s devastating that I have to say this: My daughter’s death was preventable. Freya’s stillbirth wasn’t the result of one failure. It was the result of two preventable gaps in care: the lack of tools to detect when a placenta is beginning to fail and the outdated way we’re taught to monitor fetal movement.
I thought I was doing everything right. I thought I had the correct information. I thought our extra monthly growth scans would alert us to issues. I thought feeling any movement at all meant she was okay. What I didn’t know is that changes in movement matter just as much as movement itself.
I look back and wonder, was she trying to tell me something before she died? The day before we went in, she had a series of sudden, jarring movements. Sharp, strong, unlike anything I’d felt from her before. I told myself it was a good sign. I had heard babies move less before labor. I had been told she was probably just “running out of room” or “getting ready to deliver.” Now I know that wasn’t true.
Had I known to watch for what was normal for her, had I known that sudden, intense movement can be a sign of distress, I would have gone in right away. I wouldn’t have waited 18 hours for our scheduled induction.
Instead, I trusted the reassurance I was given. I silenced the little voice inside me that said something didn’t feel right. I didn’t know she was trying to speak to me with her body, in the only way she could.
Stillbirth is a hidden crisis claiming 21,000 American babies each year. In Nebraska, an estimated 112 babies are lost annually, though poor data hides the full toll.
At least 25% of stillbirths are preventable, yet Nebraska’s latest health needs assessment ignored stillbirth prevention entirely. The U.S. is among the worst of wealthy nations for stillbirth rates and among the slowest to improve.
This is not just about statistics. It’s about babies who should be alive. About mothers who should be kissing soft cheeks instead of visiting gravestones. About siblings who should be sharing giggles and secrets, not grieving the sister they’ll never know.
I share Freya’s story because this grief, this emptiness, will be with me forever. Yet if speaking out can save even one baby, it’s worth my pain.
As a mother and a stillbirth survivor, I’m begging our medical community: Please start monitoring placental health routinely. Teach parents about fetal movement monitoring. Talk honestly about stillbirth risk. No family should leave the hospital without their baby when tragedy could have been prevented.
Freya should be here. And I will keep saying her name — and fighting for change — so other babies might live.

The bill passed and was signed into law. (Photo by Michele Jokinen/Session Daily)Minnesota House Democrats picked Rep. Zack Stephenson as their new caucus leader Monday, signaling a desire for continuity after the assassination of their late leader Melissa Hortman in June. 
Stephenson, who has represented the Coon Rapids area in the House since 2019, was Hortman’s 2004 campaign manager as an inexperienced, early 20s college student. Hortman was a mentor to Stephenson for 20 years, teaching him about campaigning, fundraising and serving a Twin Cities metro swing district. Stephenson was also a good friend of Hortman’s and served as a pallbearer during her funeral.
In a closed-door meeting, Stephenson garnered votes from the majority of the 66 House Democrats. The circumstances of Hortman’s death made choosing her successor challenging, but multiple contenders campaigned for it, including DFL floor leader Jamie Long and Reps. Tina Liebling, Dave Pinto and Cheryl Youakim.
“I am honored to have the support of my colleagues to serve as caucus leader,” Stephenson said in a statement released by House DFL Monday. “Speaker Hortman is irreplaceable — as a leader, a strategist, a colleague and a friend. While I’ve been chosen to lead, it will take all of us, working together, to move forward, honor Speaker Hortman’s legacy, and build a Minnesota where everyone can succeed. We are all still grieving, but I am confident we can carry our shared work into the future.”
Stephenson is likely to follow Hortman’s well-thumbed political playbook: raise money, recruit sound candidates and incessantly knock on doors.
The House is expected to return to a 67-67 tie between Republicans and Democrats after a Sept. 16 special election to replace Hortman in a solidly blue suburban Brooklyn Park district. Stephenson will need to negotiate with Republicans to pass any legislation, deftly say “no” to unrealistic member demands of his own caucus and raise piles of money to campaign in 2026.
If House Democrats take back control of the House next year, Stephenson will be a frontrunner for House speaker.
Rep. Aisha Gomez, the co-chair of the House Taxes Committee and a leader of the left flank of the party, called Stephenson “smart, tough, capable, empathetic,” in a text message to the Reformer. “He studied at (Hortman’s) side and she trusted him completely. He wants to do right by her and by us and the people of our state. Our caucus is united behind him and collectively we have a lot of brilliance and heart to bring to the work ahead of us.”
Stephenson served as a House Ways and Means committee co-chair this year, putting him at the center of budget negotiations with legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz. He’s also compiled a significant legislative resume, including authorship of the House bill legalizing cannabis in 2023 and a bevy of consumer protections enacted when he was chair of the Commerce Committee in 2023-24. 
Stephenson is also a Hennepin County prosecutor. 
Stephenson will have to hit the ground running: Walz said he will call a special session on gun control following the Aug. 27 mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, and Stephenson will need to work with House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, to pass any sort of gun or school safety measures. 
Hortman and her husband Mark were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a political assassination by a man who was targeting Democratic elected officials and abortion rights advocates, prosecutors say. Sen.

If there is a viable path of resistance people respond to the events as the existential crisis that is apparent.
A soft coup is insidious and diabolical. It is the choice of recent new autocrats.
If you focus the entire force of the country on one target at a time,  the target usually has no choice but to yield. Most citizens are glad it’s not them and it’s tolerated with a distant fear. 
It takes very little research to see the fate of those who engaged in capitulation and appeasement. The coup occurs in the background with little notice and alarm. This is the method the current administration is engaged in. 
Donald Trump has four goals. He is trying to take revenge on everyone who slighted him since high school, he looks for all opportunities to glorify himself,  he as found ways to monetize the presidency in the billions and is determinedly pro racist.
We are at stage three of four in this soft coup, my opinion. The enforcement branches, the Defense Department,  Justice Department, Homeland Security, the FBI and CIA are all firmly in control by the administration. Congress has seceded all their authority and guidance.
The Supreme court seems to be rooting for this takeover, abolishing one by one all the judicial safeguards that have been established over the decades. They seem to be blissfully unaware that they are sealing their own fate. They will inevitably try to resurrect some boundaries in the future, but it will be too late and seen as an intolerable interference.
Possibly the only weakness is that Trump in becoming king is doing what kings inevitably do. He is banishing all advisors that provoke disfavor and acting on his own convoluted and irrational view of the world. His goals are contradictory to the wellbeing of most of the population.
The administration is already testing all means at fixing, delaying or cancelling the next midterm election. This goes beyond expecting a political party to be our saviors.
Ordinary citizens can only vote and protest. Collectively those who wield power, the extremely wealthy, managers of institutions, lawyers, judges, academics, educators, scientists, veterans and the business community need to coalesce into a private resistance.
If five members of Congress or three members of the Supreme Court could somehow become aware that our democracy is being extinguished right as we approach our 250th anniversary, we could put an end to this.
It is hard to believe that there are no true patriots left on the right. Time to act is rapidly dwindling.

It is a time of transition when physicians can make a real difference by screening for mood disorders, substance use, school concerns, and sexually transmitted infections. For thousands of teenagers in Connecticut, this healthcare is inaccessible due to their documentation status. Husky 4 Immigrants is looking to change that. 
As an internal medicine – pediatrics physician in New Haven, I see young patients in my office for a wide range of reasons. Whether it’s a broken bone or a vaccine visit, consistent care is necessary to identify concerns and intervene early in a young person’s life. The biggest barrier to healthcare access is insurance coverage. In Connecticut, Husky Medicaid covers children up to 15 years of age regardless of immigration status. But for noncitizens aged 16 and older, healthcare is limited to emergency room visits or expensive self-pay options. 
Husky 4 Immigrants, a coalition created in 2019, is committed to creating a future where every person can access healthcare regardless of immigration status. They have already started to make this vision a reality. Since 2021, they have successfully changed policy to increase Medicaid coverage for undocumented children and pregnant individuals in Connecticut, resulting in a healthier and more productive community. The next step? Expanding coverage to all teens and young adults. 
This idea isn’t a pipe dream—it is a viable policy decision. A recent study asked: “What would happen if we expanded Medicaid to the adolescent and young adult population?” Researchers entered the data into a microsimulation, and the results were impressive. Removing immigration status from Medicaid requirements would substantially reduce the uninsured rate among this population at a relatively low cost to Connecticut. 
We wouldn’t be the first state to make such a decision. Seven states, including California, New York, and Washington, provide Medicaid to some income-eligible adults regardless of immigration status. Studies show that immigrants in these states are less likely to forgo or delay medical care. They are also more likely to utilize primary care offices rather than crowded emergency rooms for routine care. This is a cost-effective benefit for everyone in these states, decreasing hospital overcrowding and increasing the overall health of the workforce. This could be a reality for Connecticut if elected officials are willing to take the data seriously. 
Over the next few months, state representatives will meet to determine the upcoming legislative agenda. They must listen to Husky 4 Immigrants and vote to expand Medicaid coverage for 16- to 25-year-olds regardless of immigration status. At a time when our federal administration is actively making Medicaid cuts, Connecticut needs to set an example by prioritizing the health and well-being of our young people.  
When I return to my clinic, I want to focus on counseling teens about vaping or cyberbullying —not watching them fall through the cracks of a broken system. Immigration status should never stand in the way of comprehensive healthcare. Investing in our youth means investing in our collective future. Connecticut must act now.

Macsata, Guy Anthony and Jonathan Sosa",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/09/the-hidden-health-crisis-no-one-wants-to-talk-about-medical-debt/,"Medical debt has become a full-blown public health emergency; delaying care, worsening illness, deepening inequality, and destroying hope.","When we talk about the U.S. healthcare crisis, the conversations often turn to buzzwords: skyrocketing premiums, pharmaceutical greed, hospital consolidations. However, the real emergency isn’t just what’s happening inside hospitals or insurance plans. Instead, it’s what’s happening to millions of Americans: crushing medical debt.
From the frontlines of patient experience and health policy alike, it’s clear: medical debt is no longer just a financial problem. It’s a full-blown public health emergency. It’s delaying care, worsening illness, deepening inequality, and destroying hope.
Thirty-five years ago, Congress authorized the 340B Drug Pricing Program to “stretch scarce federal resources, allowing them to reach more eligible patients and provide comprehensive services.” When the Affordable Care Act was passed into law some fifteen years ago, it included provisions to strengthen the 340B Program – among them asking 340B hospitals to further help poor patients by offering charity care, which is “financial assistance”, as “free or discounted” health services.
Sadly, according to a report published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, nearly 75% of adults with medical debt owe some or all of it to hospitals. Many of these hospitals, namely 340B eligible hospitals, are also engaged in predatory collection schemes to shake down patients for money rather than offering charity care to them.
A recent nationwide survey of patients paints a grim picture:

Nearly three in four respondents (73.6%) currently carry medical debt
82.2% of that debt is owed to hospitals
66.1% are already in collections
77.4% are skipping or avoiding medical care altogether
70.7% are not filling prescriptions
70.4% say the debt has directly harmed their health
A staggering 79.1% believe they will never pay it off

This isn’t just a financial burden but a vicious cycle. People get sick, they incur debt, avoid care, get sicker, and fall deeper into debt.
Medical debt isn’t a side effect of the healthcare system; it’s the system functioning exactly as designed. But let’s be clear: medical debt is not just a financial issue; it’s a racial and economic justice issue. 
Communities of color face double the burden of poor access to care and, oftentimes, punitive billing practices. Black and Hispanic communities are 39% more likely to face debt collection judgments. And according to the Urban Institute, people of color are also more frequently targeted by collection agencies for medical bills in collections.
Limited access, worsening outcomes
The consequences are devastating. Patients are ignoring symptoms, avoiding routine checkups, and rationing life-saving medications.
This isn’t because they don’t value their health, but because they simply can’t afford it.
Delayed care is not hypothetical. It’s someone’s undiagnosed cancer or unmanaged diabetes. It’s the stroke, heart attack, or overdose that could have been prevented if only care had come sooner.
It’s also not just the physical care people are denied. It’s the emotional toll they carry. Medical debt drives stress, anxiety, and depression, which in turn worsen physical health.
There is clearly a cycle happening where poor health creates debt, and debt creates poorer health.
Imagine knowing you need help but staying silent because the last bill broke you. Imagine believing, like nearly 80% of survey respondents, that you’ll never be free of the financial consequences of getting sick.
That’s the cruel reality for millions of Americans.
A system rigged against the sick
Medical debt affects millions, not a few. It’s a systemic issue. Yet 87.2% of people in the survey said they didn’t even know about resources that might help.
What does it say about a society when the price of survival is unpayable? What does it say when the very hospitals that are afforded lucrative tax breaks in return for “community benefits” – such as charity care – fail to live up to their end of the bargain?
It’s time to change the narrative. Medical debt isn’t the result of bad budgeting. It’s the result of bad policy. 340B hospitals are choosing not to set reasonable prices and offer robust financial assistance. They sue their patients rather than provide free charity care, as is required by law. The 340B Program was designed to help patients, not pad the pockets of these healthcare providers.
We’ve normalized a system where illness is punished with lifelong financial trauma.
To fix this, we need:
●      Transparent pricing and billing
●      Patient-first reforms to hospital and drug discount programs (like 340B)
●      Increased public education about available support
Medical debt is not just a policy failure but also a moral one.
It suggests to patients that they’re alone and that getting help will cost them everything and that survival comes with a price tag that is too much for them to handle.
In other words, the healthcare system is forcing people to suffer in silence.
Unsurprisingly, it’s working exactly as it was built. And it must be rebuilt with urgency and compassion so that it can heal, not harm.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)A former state office building on Guilford Avenue in Baltimore has a unique honor: It is the only surplus state land that has been targeted for new affordable housing development after three years of trying under current state law.
It’s an underwhelming result for lawmakers who hoped to be able to offer unused state land for new housing development and cut down on Maryland’s shortage of affordable housing.
That’s one reason the Moore administration included language to streamline the current cumbersome framework for identifying surplus property as part of an executive order last week aimed at helping the state meet its ambitious housing goals.
“We need to move faster to build new homes,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said as he signed the order. “We need to move faster to make homes more affordable and protect our renters. We need to move faster to create a housing market that is more competitive.”
The surplus property proposal is just one of several in the order designed to fast-track housing development and cut into the estimated 96,000-unit shortage that officials say Maryland currently faces.
Need for speed: Executive order aims to reduce administrative hurdles to new housing

It’s not a new proposal. Lawmakers in 2022 required the state to develop a list of qualifying surplus land that could be used for affordable housing. But in the three years since that law passed, only one property ever qualified, according to a staffer from the Department of Housing and Community Development — the Guilford Avenue site.
The 2022 law prompted DHCD to work with other state agencies to identify qualifying state properties that could be used for housing. The original law said that the department “shall” deem a property qualified if it met five metrics: It was located in an area already targeted for economic development, was identified as surplus, had access to utilities, was large enough for residential use and had feasible entry and exit points.
The department was allowed to consider other factors, but those five points were requirements.
Lawmakers came back in 2024 and updated the law, to give DHCD more flexibility in the process, removing the “shall” language and letting state officials take more factors into consideration when determining whether any surplus properties qualify. That change led to the identification of 2100 Guilford Avenue as potentially suitable for housing.
“I think unfortunately there weren’t a ton of state properties that could actually be used for the development of affordable housing,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), a sponsor of both the 2022 and 2024 bills in the Senate. “If we can do it in a way that is more coordinated and expeditious, I think that’s a win for everybody.”
Expeditious is what the Moore administration has in mind for the third try at the plan to turn over surplus property to developers for affordable housing projects, hoping that the third time’s the charm.
Under the executive order, the housing department will work with the Department of General Services to create a list of surplus properties that are state-owned and appropriate for new housing development. But among other measures, the order grants DHCD more decision-making power in identifying which surplus properties could be sold or donated to developers for affordable housing projects.
The building at 2100 Guilford opened 1928 as the State Motor Vehicle Commission, an earlier version of what is now known as the Motor Vehicle Administration. It later housed the Division of Parole and Probation, only to be shuttered in 2019.

In 2022, Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced that the location would be redeveloped into a new headquarters for the Department of General Services, but the lot building currently sits empty.
On Dec. 31, 2024, Housing Secretary Jake Day said in a letter to legislative leadership that a “request for proposal is currently being drafted … for an excess state property (2100 Guilford Ave in Baltimore City) to be redeveloped as affordable housing, and that proposal will go to the Board of Public Works sometime in the near future.”
As of September, that proposal had not been presented the Board of Public Works, according to state documents.
But the slow pace so far has not daunted the Moore administration, which wants more state properties in the running. One of the biggest changes in the executive order is it gives the housing department more authority to evaluate state properties and create a list of land that could be used for housing on its own — and not have to wait for other agencies.
“The executive order’s intent is to review existing state-owned land more holistically to identify additional opportunities for surplus property that may be suitable for housing development,” according to an email from DHCD. “No State-owned properties have been deemed suitable for redevelopment as affordable housing until this year, so no reports have been released.”
It’s not clear how much more state land would qualify for affordable housing projects under the executive order. Housing officials say they will get a better idea down the line, noting that a report on state-owned properties suitable for redevelopment as affordable housing will be released in December.
Del. Julie Palakovich Carr (D-Montgomery), who sponsored the 2022 and 2024 legislation in the House, says that the executive order is a step in the right direction.
“I am really encouraged that Governor Moore and his administration are continuing to fight for housing,” Palakovich Carr (D-Montgomery) said. “It’s a huge issue in Maryland that’s affecting Marylanders across the state at all income levels. We need more housing, and this is a really great step in towards meeting those needs.”

Jim Pillen, left, and Attorney General Mike Hilgers. July 16, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission will cap cultivators for the new medicine to grow no more than 1,250 flowering plants at one time, adding a limit that the governor had requested.
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a Thursday letter to the five-member commission, said while he appreciated commissioners’ work to “ensure the cannabis industry is properly regulated,” he would not sign new emergency regulations the commission approved Sept. 2 without the group setting a limit on how many plants cannabis cultivators grow. 
“Leaving the cultivators without a limit would increase [the] likelihood of an overabundance of cannabis product that creates an unregulated, unintended black-market supply,” Pillen wrote. 
He continued: “If an inclusion of plant population limits for permitted cultivators can be included, I will support the remainder of the proposed emergency regulations to go into effect.”
Last week, the commission said it would license only four medical cannabis cultivators. The first round of cultivator applications meeting the new regulations are due by Sept. 23. Licensing must begin by Oct. 1.
Placeholder limits expanded
The Medical Cannabis Commission built its discussion on top of a placeholder draft put forward by Bo Botelho, the general counsel for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services who is advising the commission pursuant to an inter-agency agreement.
Swapped out: New Nebraska medical cannabis regs advance to final approval, draw public ire

DHHS has opposed medical cannabis in the past, which is why advocates sought and ultimately won voter approval to house the new Medical Cannabis Commission elsewhere, that being the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission.
Botelho said he worked backward from Missouri’s plant limits, noting the neighboring state grows plants for recreational and medicinal use. He proposed a much more stringent limit than allowed in the neighboring Show-Me State.
He had proposed the following placeholder limits:

Indoor facilities: 200 flowering plants.
Outdoor facilities: 500 flowering plants.
Greenhouse facilities: 300 flowering plants.
A combination of the three types: 200 flowering plants.

“The numbers that I came to isn’t the result of any real math,” Botelho said. “I just put some numbers in there to start with.”
Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln led a push to increase the number of plants allowed. He noted some plants might be lost to crop failure while others might not meet new commission testing requirements. Bailey said he also wanted to be sure there was enough supply for Nebraska patients.

Four of Nebraska’s six bordering states have legal medical cannabis programs, with the percentage of residents in those states using the programs as follows: Iowa, 0.55%; Colorado, 1.05%; South Dakota, 1.26%; and Missouri, 1.95%, according to the Marijuana Policy Project.
Using a rough ratio of one plant serving every two patients, Bailey and other commissioners worked toward serving approximately 1% of the state, or a prospective 20,000 Nebraskans.
Meeting patient demand
Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, an addiction prevention specialist with Heartland Family Service, said Nebraska also might not have 20,000 patients “right off the bat,” and joined with Commissioner Kim Lowe of Kearney, voicing an intent to review the numbers in the future.
Mueting said that in the limited time between Pillen’s Thursday decision not to sign on and the commission’s “emergency” Monday meeting, she had researched that 2,000 indoor plants might be able to produce enough tinctures for 2,300 patients each year.
“I don’t know how all this translates into plants, because, again, … how much flower a plant can produce depends on how it’s grown, how it’s cultivated,” Mueting said.

Rather than set specific limits for indoor, outdoor or greenhouse facilities, Bailey proposed the 1,250 plant limit, no matter the type of facility. That would mean that with a total of four cultivators, there could be 5,000 active plants at once with two harvests anticipated annually, meeting the 10,000 plant goal.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the nonprofit that led the successful 2024 petition campaign, said the commission was going to “starve” a program before it could start. 
“On your hands will be the blood of the patients in the state,” she said.
Lia Post of Springfield, who has complex regional pain syndrome, again urged the commission to see her and other Nebraskans as patients.
“My illness doesn’t change at state lines,” Post said. “I guarantee you I’m going to use cannabis instead of opioids or benzodiazepines or sedatives or ketamine, and if the most offensive thing I can do is cuss at you or tell you what a bunch of idiots you are, freedom of speech has gone to hell in Nebraska.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission is scheduled to meet next at 1 p.m. on Sept. 30.



What would the latest medical cannabis emergency regulations mean?
If approved, the latest set of emergency medical cannabis regulations would replace an earlier set that would expire by Sept. 28. The new set would be in effect for a new 90-day period. 
The latest regulations would establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” and also make Nebraska’s program essentially a low-THC variety.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. Of that, patients could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within a 90-day period. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
The amended regulations would maintain a limit of up to 12 medical cannabis dispensaries statewide arranged by judicial district. That would mean one dispensary each in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data.
The rules would still prohibit dispensaries from selling smoking or vaping products and edibles of any kind. While the earlier rules would have allowed the sale of non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, the revised rules would not. Oral tablets with a “thin layer” of flavoring to make the products swallowable would now be allowed.
Under current law, a patient or qualified caregiver with a recommendation from any health care practitioner can legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, in any form. But no licenses have yet been issued, so cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska yet.

(Photo by Airman 1st Class Gracelyn Hess/U.S. Air Force)More study of changing conditions in the Arctic, a region where Russia and other nations are increasing their military presence, is needed to support U.S. national defense, according to a new federal report.
The U.S. Arctic Research Commission, an independent federal agency that advises the White House and Congress, made the recommendation in a brief report released last month.
“The Arctic region is critical to the defense of our homeland, the protection of U.S. national sovereignty, and the fulfillment of our nation’s defense commitments. Research is critical to ensuring that the United States sustains strategic and tactical advantages over our competitors and adversaries as Arctic conditions evolve,” the commission said.
The commission said its report is intended to help guide the next federal five-year Arctic research plan, for 2027 through 2031, that is being developed by the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, a collaboration of 18 federal agencies. The U.S. Arctic Research Commission and Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee are related organizations, both created by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984.
Along with military security, other Arctic issues that should be the subject of further research are also classified in the commission’s report as aspects of security.
One is energy, which is expensive in rural Alaska. Although the report does not specifically mention renewable energy, it advocates for research into a variety of energy sources.
“Energy that is locally produced, affordable, and from diversified sources is required to greatly enhance energy security for Alaskan communities, commercial development, and military installations,” the report said.
Another need that the report said research should address is “economic security.” Alaska fisheries deserve special attention, said the report, which noted that the state is the world’s seventh largest seafood exporter and that the industry generates more than $5 billion in annual revenue.
More study of seafood issues is important to Alaska Natives, the report said. Native communities “have relied on fishing for centuries to sustain their customary and traditional way of life,” it said. “Changes that impact these fisheries are occurring both on land and in the ocean, and research and infrastructure that allows continuous environmental monitoring are needed to understand the impact of these changes and ensure viable and prosperous fisheries.”
Meanwhile, a separate research organization with non-governmental partners is set to end operations in a few weeks.
The Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, a research-coordinating organization that traces its history to the late 1950s and was formally established in 1988, plans to shut down at the end of this month. The commission, with partners that include the University of Alaska’s Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program, the Anchorage Museum and the Eskimo Walrus Commission, had been mostly funded by the National Science Foundation. The Trump administration axed that funding this year.

Deaton is sponsoring the new congressional district map being debated in a special session. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)The Missouri House on Monday moved the new congressional district map demanded by President Donald Trump one step closer to passing.
The only drama during the more than four hours of debate was whether any Republicans would vote against the revisions intended to give the GOP safe seats in seven of Missouri’s eight congressional districts. 
When the vote came to give preliminary approval to the new map, 12 of the chamber’s 107 Republicans — including House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit — voted against it, along with all Democrats present. The vote was 89-63, setting  up a final vote Tuesday that will send the bill to the state Senate.
Once the debate began, state Rep. Dirk Deaton, the Republican from Noel who is sponsoring the new map, said the legislation is an attempt to “improve” the redistricting plan approved at the end of tumultuous debates in 2022. 
Deaton denied that the map was designed in the White House and given to lawmakers to pass.
“This map came from the governor’s office, and it was written at the governor’s direction by the staff,” he said.
Under questioning from state Rep. Jo Doll, a Democrat from St. Louis, Deaton said redistricting was not an issue in the regular session earlier this year because there was no consensus, no “groundswell of support” to work on redistricting during the regular legislative session.
Doll responded by accusing Republicans of manipulating the electoral process for one reason — because Trump demanded it.
“This is nothing more than the Republican Party pandering to Donald Trump and his agenda,” Doll said. “We all heard the directive. We’re not stupid over here, we know where this came from. And it’s not the governor’s office.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, speaks to reporters Monday prior to the House’s session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, said at a news conference before the debate that she expected most Republicans who oppose the bill to remain silent.
“It’s what they do day in and day out in this building,” Aune said. “It is exhausting to watch, but it is their normal, and I’m certain that it will happen again.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe called the special session after weeks of speculation following a report in late July that Trump wanted Missouri to redraw districts so the GOP could take the 5th District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. 
Texas lawmakers were already meeting to find Republicans five additional seats in the 34-member delegation from that state. California has followed suit, putting a new map on the ballot for November intended to shift five seats to Democrats.
With those large states cancelling each other out, the fight has moved to smaller states like Missouri. With a 219-212 majority in the 435-seat House of Representatives — four seats are vacant, including three previously held by Democrats — Republicans are worried that a small shift in voter sentiment could put them again in the minority.
Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The state Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times. 
Democrats seem resigned to losing the initial battle in the legislative chambers, but hold out hope for defeating the measure in court or at the ballot box.
The lack of clear authority for mid-term redistricting, as well as procedural questions in the special session, are ripe for the courts to decide, Aune said.
“It’s unconstitutional from the start to the finish,” she said during the news conference.
Cleaver has vowed to sue if lawmakers pass a new map. 
Deaton also defended the map as constitutional, arguing that Democrats’ warnings they will sue would be doomed to failure.
“There’s no evidence to support this,” Deaton said. “There’s nothing to back this up, just ‘this is unconstitutional.’”
The bill was given first-round approval without an emergency clause that would make it effective with Kehoe’s signature. If the bill is passed as expected, opponents would have 90 days to gather signatures to force a statewide vote on the bill.
St. Louis Public Radio reported Monday that the Missouri AFL-CIO is considering whether to launch a petition drive to force a referendum vote. If enough signatures are gathered before the law takes effect, it would be held in abeyance until after the vote.
Missouri Republicans are pushing to enact this map to revise congressional district lines in a special session. The GOP’s goal is to win the 5th District seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat (Screenshot from Missouri House website).
The bill makes many changes to the current districts to bring enough Republican voters into the 5th District to flip it to the GOP and distribute Democratic votes to dilute their impact on other districts.
The 5th District does see the most substantial changes. Previously encompassing nearly all of Kansas City, the district now only includes the city’s east side, then stretches east to encompass Jefferson City all the way to Phelps County. It also includes the northern portion of Boone County, but not the Democrat-leaning areas of Columbia. 
The 5th District also picks up six counties from the 3rd District — Cole, Cooper, Howard, Maries, Moniteau and Miller counties as well as Morgan County from the 4th District.
The 4th and 6th Districts are where the Kansas City voters who previously all lived in the 5th will be moved. 
The 4th District loses parts of Columbia, along with Sedalia and Warrensburg to the 5th District in order to pick up downtown Kansas City. It is represented by Republican Mark Alford. 
The 6th District runs across the entire northern half of the state, picking up a piece of Kansas City north of the Missouri River. 
Two districts would be untouched — the 7th District in southwest Missouri and 8th District in southeast Missouri, both represented by Republicans. It only tinkers with the 1st District, based in St. Louis and represented by Democrat Wesley Bell.
Other changes made on the east side of the state would swap voters between the 2nd and 3rd districts. 
The 2nd District, represented by Republican Ann Wagner, moves south of the Missouri River, taking in southern St. Louis suburbs along with Gasconade,  Crawford, Jefferson and Washington counties. 
The 3rd District, represented by Republican Bob Onder, takes over all of St. Charles and Warren counties, adding Audrain, Lincoln, Monroe, Pike and Ralls counties as it stretches north to Hannabil and encompasses nearly all of Columbia.
As Aune predicted, there were few Republicans willing to buck the party majority to oppose the bill.
State Rep. Marty Joe Murray, a Democrat from St. Louis, said Republicans had told him in whispers that they didn’t believe in the bill.
“Why aren’t they here, saying that on the microphone?” he said.
Several GOP members had said, when the idea was first being floated, that they didn’t want to go through redistricting again. Only one Republican spoke against it on the floor.
State Rep. Tony Harbison, a Republican from Arcadia, said he’s concerned about senior centers in his district being able to provide meals and property taxes that are forcing people out of their homes.
“Our plate is full of things that need to be done for the people of this state,” Harbison said, “and this ain’t one of them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Deaton-patterson-01302025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 21:58:24.214891

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/california-cap-and-trade-negotiations/,California lawmakers are rushing to extend the state’s landmark cap-and-trade climate program through 2045 amid opposition from unions and industry.,"In summary
California lawmakers are rushing to extend the state’s landmark cap-and-trade climate program through 2045 amid opposition from unions and industry.


California lawmakers are scrambling to finalize a last-minute deal that would extend the state’s landmark greenhouse gas reduction program – known as cap and trade – through 2045. 
At the center of this year’s reauthorization fight are a number of controversial concessions that former Gov. Jerry Brown gave to various industries – including oil and gas – when the Legislature last renewed the program in 2017. Those include giveaways that allow fossil fuel companies and others to emit greenhouse gases free of charge, as well as permission for some market participants to purchase questionably effective carbon offsets to meet emissions targets.
To the chagrin of environmental advocates, Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this summer proposed reupping the program as-is, an early sign of his blossoming friendliness with the fuel industry as he eyes a presidential bid in 2028.
The twist? There’s no bill. And even if the text of legislation comes out by the Wednesday deadline to introduce it, opponents argue that such a critical policy should not be rushed through at the last minute.
“We are in the last week of session, and no one has seen the language of what a program would look like,” read a pamphlet that lobbyists from the business community were circulating to members in the Capitol Monday. “Rushing a bad deal to determine the next 20 years of climate policy is the wrong approach.”
Even some environmental advocates who want to see the program renewed have griped about the opacity of the negotiations, which have primarily unfolded behind closed doors. While the Assembly has circulated draft language that closely resembles Newsom’s proposal, the Senate has kept its language under lock and key. According to two people familiar with the negotiations, Senate President Pro Tem’s Mike McGuire’s staff  has only allowed members to view the proposed legislative text in person and prohibited them from bringing copies – printed, digital or photos – back to their staff. 
Environmental justice advocates have long criticized the cap-and-trade program for failing to reduce pollution at refineries and other industrial sources, which are often located in low-income and minority communities. Because cap and trade allows companies to comply with greenhouse gas limits by buying credits, large polluters can continue operating in low-income neighborhoods without improving air quality or reducing emissions
Proponents of swift reauthorization say the carbon market needs certainty that the program will continue to exist in order to keep pulling in revenues. Over the past 11 years, almost $13 billion from cap-and-trade auctions has paid for electric vehicles, public transit, clean energy and other projects to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change.
A flurry of appeals to lawmakers
As lawmakers entered the Capitol on Monday, a welcoming committee of lobbyists and advocates descended on them, armed with pamphlets urging the members to halt negotiations over cap and trade and kick the conversation to next year.
The opponents included representatives from the fossil fuels industry, business groups and even the state’s influential trade unions, who often have the ear of Democrats in Sacramento but many of whose members are employed by the oil and gas industry and other major polluters. 
They argued that a rushed plan to reauthorize cap and trade would unnecessarily raise costs on industries ranging from cement production to oil and gas and manufacturing and push them out of California. That, the groups argue, would result in job losses as well as higher prices as companies pass their increased costs along to consumers. 
“No deal is better than a bad deal,” read a notice sent to members from the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California and obtained by CalMatters. “Negotiations on this complex and essential policy should be halted and picked back up in the earliest days of 2026 when the Legislature reconvenes.”

The union argued that the Legislature’s proposals would lead to “massive industrial job losses” and “skyrocketing fuel and retail costs” that would harm California families. 
“We are disappointed that the Legislature has not been able to work with the Building Trades and the energy industry to advance a clean extension of cap and trade that prioritizes affordability,” the pamphlet read.
The California Chamber of Commerce, a business advocacy group that often finds itself on the opposite side of the trades union, agreed that the shortened timeline wasn’t sufficient to produce a “robust and responsible” piece of legislation. 
“For months, we have heard promises that issues affecting California’s affordability were at the top of the list,” said Jennifer Barrera, group’s president and CEO. “But this vital issue will have to wait.”
While mainstream environmental groups like Environmental Defense Fund generally support reauthorizing the program, they’re irked about the obscure nature of the negotiations. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates say that the flood of last-minute lobbying to delay the reauthorization came because they were finally making progress at the negotiating table. 
“They’re saying that because they’re losing ground,” said Katie Valenzuela, a lobbyist for environmental justice groups. “These folks have unprecedented access to members in the building, and so for them to argue that there needs to be more public process is just comical.”
“Everyone is still at the table and working towards a negotiated proposal,” said Santa Barbara Democrat Sen. Monique Limón, the incoming Senate president. “So long as everyone is still working collaboratively, the possibility to get this done remains.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090123_Suspense_RL_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 21:58:24.214891

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The top oil-producing company in Alaska is planning significant layoffs, it announced last week.
In a series of statements, the oil giant ConocoPhillips said it will be firing between 20% and 25% of its global workforce of about 13,000 people. That would mean between 2,600 and 3,250 layoffs worldwide.
“We are always looking at how we can be more efficient with the resources we have. As part of this process, we have informed employees that a 20% to 25% reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, is anticipated. The majority of these reductions will take place in 2025,” said Rebecca Boys, director of external affairs for ConocoPhillips Alaska, on Thursday.
Boys declined to say how many people the company employs in Alaska, but prior documents published by the company say that it has “about 1,000 people in Alaska,” and of those, about 80% live in the state.
Altogether, the oil and gas industry employed 8,800 people in Alaska as of July, according to state statistics. If ConocoPhillips were to lay off a quarter of its Alaska workforce, it likely would reverse an upward trend for the oil and gas industry here.
Since bottoming out at 6,100 people in November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, the number of people employed by the oil and gas industry rose throughout President Joe Biden’s administration.
ConocoPhillips produces the most oil of any company operating on the North Slope and holds the second-most oil and gas lease area in the state.
According to state data, ConocoPhillips leases about 490,000 acres of Alaska land and water for oil and gas drilling. That’s behind only privately owned Hilcorp, whose holdings exceed 500,000 acres.
ConocoPhillips is developing the large Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is expected to begin producing oil in 2029. 
According to the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas, ConocoPhillips is also planning to drill four exploration wells in other parts of the reserve this winter.
On its production side, ConocoPhillips was planning to drill 12 new production wells this year and next from the Kuparuk oilfield west of Prudhoe Bay.

(Courtesy of Getty Images)As Pennsylvania’s budget stalemate entered another week, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced a measure that will provide a two-year funding solution for the largest mass-transit agency in the state.
On Monday, Shapiro directed state Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Secretary Mike Carroll to approve the Southeast Transportation Authority’s (SEPTA) request to use $394 million of their capital dollars from the Public Transportation Trust Fund (PTTF) for operating expenses. 
The decision comes three days after SEPTA leadership sent a letter to Carroll requesting the move, since lawmakers have not been able to come to a long-term funding solution since the June 30th budget deadline passed.
“This plan will preserve service for about 800,000 Pennsylvanians for the next two years,” Shapiro told reporters at an unrelated event in Philadelphia on Monday.
Mass transit agencies across the commonwealth, including SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT), have sounded the alarm over the past year about the impact of not having a long-term solution on services in urban, suburban, and rural areas.

While Shapiro and House Democrats sought a long-term funding solution that would bring new, recurring revenue for the state’s mass transit agencies, Republicans in the Senate majority rejected their proposals.
SEPTA instituted service cuts a few weeks ago and fare increases were set to go into effect, as well.
As a result of the transfer at the request of SEPTA, the service cuts will be rescinded on Sunday, Sept. 14. However, the 21.5% system-wide fare increase will also be reinstated on that same day.
“This is not the long-term funding solution we need to address our $213 million budget deficit,” said SEPTA General Manager Scott A. Sauer. “But over the last two weeks, we have seen the devastating effects of the service cuts on our customers. Our riders deserve better, and they deserve stability.”
Shapiro said the decision was made in part because “folks were struggling to get to work and wondering how they were going to get to their destination, get their families where they needed to go.”
The governor highlighted the 63% increase in Philadelphia schools of late arrivals and 50% of schools having higher absenteeism rates since the start of the school year, when these service cuts went into effect.
“I must tell you that that really tugged at me in my conversations with (Philadelphia school) Superintendent (Tony) Watlington. It was just clear to me that is not something we can allow to continue,” Shapiro said. “And of course, we are looking at not just the daily needs of this great community, but starting next year, millions of people will be descending upon the city of Philadelphia and our entire commonwealth as we celebrate the 250th birth of this nation, and we needed to get this done.”
The Associated Press reported on Monday afternoon that PRT is “likely” to provide a similar request as SEPTA to avoid service reduction and fare increases. 
Shapiro says he expects a final budget “will not include recurring funding for mass transit”
The topic of mass transit funding has dominated discussion over a state budget, which has still not passed the General Assembly.
House Democrats have been advocating for a long-term funding package for mass transit agencies by sending an additional 1.75% of the state’s total sales tax revenue their way.

Republicans in the Senate have largely balked at this request, citing other priorities and fiscal concerns in the budget. Instead the GOP-led Senate approved a proposal along party lines that would allow those transportation entities to transfer a limited amount of those capital funds to operations, while also requiring fare increases indexed to inflation in 2026, 2027 and every other year thereafter (leaving open the possibility to seek a waiver). 
That measure was rejected by Democrats who said those funds were intended for long-term capital and maintenance projects, and preferred to fund the state’s transit authorities by increasing the share of sales tax diverted to them.
Shapiro told reporters on Monday that his action was not mirroring the GOP proposal previously approved by the Senate.
“It is clearly two different packages,” Shapiro said. “The Senate proposal, which was flawed and was dead on arrival in the House and would not have gotten my signature, would have required mass transit systems to utilize their current capital funding in order to fill the gap, and there would be no revenue source for the future.”
“They would have taken money from existing projects away, and importantly, they would have taken half of the Transit Trust Fund money and sent it to road and bridge repair,” he added.
Shapiro said that while he understands the importance for repairing roads and bridges, he would not support using money that was set aside for mass transit to fund road and bridge projects.
Republicans, including those who have voted for mass transit funding, have previously criticized Shapiro for flexing federal highway funding towards SEPTA to prevent immediate service cuts and fare increases. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) framed the proposal to send mass transit funds to road and bridge repair as something of a reprisal during debate last month.
“We are now allowing SEPTA to use $394 million of future capital dollars that have not yet been earmarked for particular projects in order to operate their system over the next two years,” Shapiro said.
The action also requires SEPTA to report-in periodically to PennDOT on changes that they are making to create a more efficient transit system.
When discussing the current state of budget negotiations, Shapiro said that the issue of mass transit was a reason Senate Republicans gave for not passing a final budget.
“The issue that they had been highlighting as a reason to not get it done is now off the table,” Shapiro said. “It is time to close this out.”
Senate Appropriations Chairman Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) told reporters in Harrisburg that having the “SEPTA issue off the table is one component that was kind of intertwined with this, but there’s still other major issues that we have to discuss.”
“One of the biggest being the fact that we have this massive structural deficit and what are we going to do to rein this in as best as possible,” Martin said. “So I would say from that perspective, we’re not where I can say that I’m ready to ascertain who’s voting for what.”
Shapiro said he spent time over the weekend with the leaders in budget negotiations, including Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa. While Republicans hold a multiple seat majority in the Senate, Shapiro said the final budget would need some Democratic votes.
“It has become abundantly clear that Leader Costa is going to need to put up votes in order for any budget to pass in the Senate,” Shapiro said.

Martin told NBC10 on Aug. 28 that a long-term solution for SEPTA was “not going to happen” for the current budget.
Shapiro said that he’s pleased that the agency will be able to continue to run for two years as a result of the transferring of funds, and that he’d continue to fight for recurring revenue for all mass transit agencies in the state.
“What I expect now is a final budget deal that will not include recurring funding for mass transit,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star. “The Senate Republicans have made clear they will not do that.”
“So…I expect a commonwealth budget deal that will include all the other important initiatives, from funding our schools to funding our cops, to funding our veterans, mental health and much more,” he added.
Rep. Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia), who chairs the House Transportation Committee, credited Shapiro for approving the transfer of funding for SEPTA to provide lawmakers two years to come up with a long-term solution, although he emphasized that other transit agencies across the state will not benefit from this latest action.
Neilson also did not say that a long-term transportation funding solution was off the table.
“There’s not one thing off the table, including transit funding, including, let me be clear, until that budget goes to that second floor for the governor to sign. There’s not one thing off the table,” he said.

The bill, passed twice in the House, including this year, has so far failed in the Senate. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Supporters of federal legislation that would impose requirements for voters to prove they are U.S. citizens stopped in Annapolis for a rally Monday.
About 60 people attended a rally for the SAVE Act — Safeguard American Voter Eligibility — in the shadow of the Maryland State House. The bill would mandate that state elections officials require and document proof of U.S. citizenship from new voters before they could vote in federal elections.
Currently, all states require new voters to attest to being a U.S. citizen when registering. Supporters of the federal bill said those efforts are not adequate.
“The bottom line is we have to start with the most obvious, only citizens should vote now,” said Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), chair of the House Freedom Caucus in Congress. “By the way, they’ll tell you, well, it’s not true.
“We need the SAVE Act. We need it sooner rather than later,” Harris said.

“Now I find that interesting from a county that’s completely governed by Democrats locally in their state delegation,” Morgan said. “So, if they’re willing to enforce this on something as trivial as entering the fair, they should be able to do this for something as important as your federal, state and local elections. That is only common sense.”
But opponents of the bill say it will restrict the right to vote for millions of Americans.
“We’ve seen this before,” Michael Waldman, president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in a March letter to Congress. “When Kansas and Arizona tried to implement their own proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting, they blocked tens of thousands of eligible American citizens from registering.
“This year in New Hampshire, which recently enacted a similar requirement, eligible voters have already been turned away at the polls because they didn’t have citizenship papers on-hand,” Waldman wrote. He said the bill, if passed, would be “the worst voting bill to be passed by Congress in memory, likely ever.”
A similar bill passed the House of Representatives in 2024 but died in the Senate. That bill passed the House again this year on a mostly party-line vote in April, but has again stalled in the Senate, where a companion bill has yes to get a hearing. Even if it got out of committee in the Senate, the bill would need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster before it can get a final vote.
Harris, the only Republican in Maryland’s congressional delegation, was the only vote from the state in favor of the bill. All seven House Democrats from Maryland opposed it.
On Thursday, advocates said they hoped to clear the Senate hurdle this year.
The tour is sponsored by the group Tea Party Patriots Action. The stop in Annapolis is the 20th before the group arrives in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday for the final stop of the tour.
“Our goal is to get the Save Act passed, and to get it passed, we’ve got to at least get a vote in the Senate,” said Tea Party Patriots Action Honorary Chairman Jenny Beth Martin said. “If we can’t get it passed in the Senate, then we need to look at attaching it to must-pass legislation.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Martin said those efforts could include shoehorning the language into the National Defense Authorization Act or a spending bill such as a continuing budget resolution to keep the government operating.
“These are bills that usually — eventually — the minority party in the Senate votes for because they don’t want to have a government shutdown going on forever, or they feel like they must pass the National Defense Authorization Act,” Martin said. “So, if we can attach it to a bill like that, then we have a better chance of passing it.”
The change would only affect federal elections. State and local elections would be unaffected. Several municipalities in the state including the Frederick, Hyattsville, Mount Rainier and Takoma Park allow undocumented immigrants to vote in city elections only.
The bill, if passed into law, would require elections boards to document proof of citizenship from voters. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.

The letter stated the move does not promote public safety. Instead, it “is an unprecedented, unscrupulous power grab that undermines states’ rights,” the Democrats wrote.
The letter also states that deploying Georgia troops to another state conflicts with the Constitution because it does not grant “the power, nor the authority, to send Georgia’s National Guard troops into another jurisdiction that does not consent.”
“Georgia cannot invade another state or district, even at the president’s request,” the letter stated.
The Trump administration was sued last week by D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb over the ongoing presence of National Guard troops in Washington, arguing the deployment amounts to a military occupation and violates the district’s right to self-rule.
Democrats also raised concerns about the cost of the deployment. Since the Georgia National Guard is not a federalized force, they argued that Georgia taxpayers will pay the cost of sending troops to Washington and asked Kemp to provide the estimated cost of the deployment, along with the scope and scale and a timeline of the mission.
“Georgia doesn’t need or want an authoritarian governor unilaterally sending our Georgia troops to augment Trump’s political agenda. We demand an immediate recall and reversal of this policy,” Georgia Democrats wrote.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC0628-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 19:56:56.885151

The state’s lawsuit said they have been exposed to rats, spoiled meals and no clean water.","In summary
About 14,000 people are housed in L.A.’s jail on a daily basis. The state’s lawsuit said they have been exposed to rats, spoiled meals and no clean water.


Citing “inhumane conditions” and a “shocking rate of deaths,” Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday announced that the state is suing Los Angeles County over conditions in its jail system.
“We can’t wait any longer,” Bonta said at a press conference. “We need comprehensive reform and we need it now.”
The lawsuit, filed on Monday, seeks to compel the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and Correctional Health Services to implement widespread changes, including to its health care, conditions of confinement and grievance procedures.
“Our lawsuit will be the driving impetus to make those changes reality,” said Bonta. “Every person in custody deserves safety, health care, dignity.”
About 14,000 people on average are housed in L.A.’s jail on a daily basis. The state’s lawsuit said they have been exposed to rat infestations, spoiled meals and no clean water. 
Over the past decade, nearly 40% of deaths in the Los Angeles County jails were caused by preventable circumstances, the lawsuit said. According to the lawsuit, three dozen custody deaths have already taken place in Los Angeles County jails this year. 
Despite decades of court monitoring over Los Angeles County jails, perilous conditions and constitutional violations continue to persist, the lawsuit stated. Meanwhile, the county has spent millions of dollars to defend and settle litigation regarding those violations. 
“Instead of addressing root causes or devoting resources to resolving acknowledged violations, Defendants have engaged in a longstanding pattern of resisting oversight and accountability,” the state attorney general’s office wrote in the complaint.
The Los Angeles system is the state’s largest, operating eight jails throughout the county. The county is one of several that has faced scrutiny for poor conditions and preventable deaths. The state last year appointed an official charged with investigating jail deaths and Bonta’s office previously opened a civil rights inquiry focused on the Riverside County jail. 
And, last year, CalMatters reported that deaths in local jails increased even as their population declined because of changes to state sentencing laws. 
The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This story will be updated when the department responds.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utahns now have a new resource to help resolve homeowners’ association disputes, with the newly-created Office of the Homeowners’ Association Ombudsman. 
Officially launched on Monday under the direction of the Utah Department of Commerce, the office is a result of a bill — HB217 — passed by the Utah Legislature earlier this year to regulate homeowners’ associations, or HOAs. 
Now, the Office of the Homeowners’ Association Ombudsman will review requests from either HOAs or their residents, then issue an opinion — however, the office will only deal with questions surrounding state law, not specific rules enforced by individual HOAs. 
“The focus here is not to try and weigh in on whether your garbage cans come in on time or what color your house is,” said bill sponsor Rep. Neil Walter, R-St. George, during the legislative session. 
Instead, Walter said, it could target things like financial disclosures, laws pertaining to political yard signs or other matters related to Utah code.  
In addition to advising HOAs and its members, the office will also maintain a registry of all Utah HOAs, and offer educational resources and training sessions for residents and HOAs. 
“Our office is here to make a tangible difference by offering practical, accessible services like impartial advisory opinions on questions of state law and valuable educational resources,” said Erin Rider, who will lead the office, in a statement. “We are dedicated to helping residents and associations navigate issues and build stronger relationships.”
All HOAs must register with the office or face disciplinary action from the state that may include not being able to enforce liens against homeowners.

Sept. 8, 2025 | ScreenshotU.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, previously the president and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, visited a Detroit high school on Monday, and then later spoke at Hillsdale College, igniting criticism from Michigan Democrats and education groups as the federal government continues talk of cutting education funding and as Michigan schools started this month without funding from the state.
In a statement, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said McMahon’s visit comes as Republicans in Congress and the state Legislature both work to dismantle public education.
“Linda McMahon’s visit to a Michigan high school underscores Republican attacks on our public schools, and they’re hoping we don’t notice,” Hertel said. “Here in Michigan, state House Republicans are cutting millions from the education budget and ripping free school meals away from working families. … Whether it’s state House Republicans or underqualified loyalist Linda McMahon, the Republican Party is raising costs for families and failing to support teachers and schools.”
The administration of President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in the U.S. House and Senate crafted a 2026 fiscal year budget with billions in dollars of cuts to public K-12 schools across the nation. Meanwhile, Michigan House Republicans have proposed K-12 spending cuts, but also dramatically changing the way schools are funded – if their budget priorities prevail in the final round of budget negotiations with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Democratic-led state Senate. 
Schools in Michigan have been warning that they are now operating without real budgets that reflect the dollars they’ll actually be receiving from the state in the next fiscal year. Some school groups have said that layoff notices have already been issued because of the standoff.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

The Detroit Federation of Teachers also said that it was deeply disappointed in the visit from McMahon, as well as Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall, given their ongoing support for deep cuts to Michigan public schools.
“These visits are nothing more than staged photo opportunities designed to sell policies that will hurt our students and our schools,” Lakia Wilson-Lumpkins, president of Detroit Federation of Teachers, said in a statement. “At a time when Detroit children need smaller class sizes, better resources, and stronger supports, Secretary McMahon and Representative Hall are advancing their schemes to expand school vouchers and strip away funding, resources and opportunity from the most vulnerable, our impoverished and students receiving special education assistance. Love is an action word, it’s time they show us how much they love our nation’s schoolchildren and educators.”
The group noted that Detroit’s institutions of public education have long faced inequitable funding, staffing shortages and aging infrastructure. School funding depends on a community’s local tax base, but the group said Monday that the model has placed Detroit children at a systemic disadvantage.
“Our children – and our future – do not have a price tag,” Jason Posey, the group’s executive vice president, said in a statement. “We should be pouring everything we have into the next generation of leaders, not stripping away the resources they need to succeed. Public schools should be a promise, not a target for cuts.”

Michigan Department of Education President Pamela Pugh, in a statement, said McMahon also visited the Great Lakes Bay region of the state, prompting her and other leaders in Saginaw, Bay City and Midland to call foul on the trip as Michigan Republicans continue to be part of the problem in broken budget negotiations.
“While students, families, and state workers face uncertainty, House Republicans are spending time at the fairgrounds hosting a political event with the former World Wrestling Entertainment executive – now the U.S. Secretary of Education – instead of completing the work of governing,” Pugh said. “Michigan still needs a transparent, student-centered budget that keeps kids fed, counselors and social workers on staff, and teachers in classrooms. Do the job. Pass the budget.”
Pugh, who is also a candidate for state Senate, added that McMahon, at the federal level, is pushing to shrink the U.S. government’s role in education, creating uncertainty for states, districts and families.
“That threatens school meals, teacher retention, and school-based mental-health services students depend on,” Pugh said. “Working families and our children deserve better.”
She also called out Hall and his Republican colleagues for proposing cuts to things like free school meals by rolling up that funding into per-pupil dollars schools receive for each student.
“Michigan students and educators need stability now – meals on trays, counselors and social workers in buildings, and teachers supported to stay in our classrooms,” Pugh said. “Instead, Lansing is mired in a House GOP-driven stalemate that would roll universal school meals, per-pupil mental-health and school-safety supports, and other essentials into a single block grant, leaving districts in limbo at the start of the school year. Our children and their educators are becoming the casualties of callous policies that disregard people and shift public dollars toward privatization and instability.”

So… Matt Hall and Donald Trump’s Secretary of Education showed up at Renaissance High School in Detroit today.
They’re on their “returning education to states” tour.
One problem – because of Hall and Republicans, our schools still don’t have a budget.

Democratic state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, who is also one of several candidates for the U.S. Senate in 2026, said Hall and House Republicans failed to pass a budget for months, then proposed $1.4 billion in cuts, only to host McMahon in Michigan just a month later.
“This morning, a Trump cabinet official slipped into one of our high schools for a closed-door meeting about defunding public education,” McMorrow said. “If they have their way, special education, after school programs, and even school lunches will be slashed. We will fight their efforts to take away resources from our kids and our communities.”

Laura Kelly related to demands by the administration of President Donald Trump to release personal information about Kansans enrolled in the SNAP food aid program. Joining Kobach at a news conference were state Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, left, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, right. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a lawsuit Monday against Gov. Laura Kelly to force disclosure to federal officials of names, Social Security numbers, birthdates and home addresses for everyone enrolled in SNAP.
Kobach said he filed a motion in Shawnee County District Court to compel the Democratic governor to comply with his interpretation of state and federal statute on sharing information sought by the federal government. The Republican attorney general said he chose to act before a Sept. 19 deadline that could lead to loss of $10.4 million in federal aid to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
SNAP serves 188,000 Kansans and makes use of $400 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds annually.
Kobach said it was rare for an attorney general to directly file suit against a governor, but he felt compelled to do so for the second time in three years because “when a governor flagrantly violates the law it is necessary for the state, represented by its attorney general, to take action.”
“She appears to be playing a game of chicken, apparently unaware of her obligation under Kansas statute and perhaps also unaware that federal law requires her to provide this information,” Kobach said.
Kobach said he didn’t have a personal conversation with the governor in an attempt to resolve the conflict prior to filing the suit. He was joined at the news conference by House Speaker Dan Hawkins, who advised the governor capitulate to the Trump administration’s requests.
“Attorney General Kobach and Speaker Hawkins are engaging in what can only be described as low-rent political theater,” the governor said. “We learned last week that the attorney general made vague statements about suing me in Alaska. My chief of staff made requests to both the attorney general and speaker for meetings to discuss this issue on Friday, and both declined to meet.”
“Now, in a rushed press conference rife with false statements and incorrect law, we learn there is going to be a lawsuit filed. A copy of which my office has yet to receive,” said Kelly, who is chair of the Democratic Governors Association. “The attorney general is known for not doing his homework or placing priority on protecting Kansans’ private data. I have always worked to protect Kansans, especially from federal overreach, and I will continue to do so.”
For several months, USDA has applied pressure on Laura Howard, secretary of the Kansas Department for Children and Families, to divulge all personal data in its possession on SNAP recipients. USDA indicated the information could be used for about a dozen purposes, including an attempt to figure out why about 10% of the people awarded SNAP benefits in Kansas might not be eligible.
Howard, who also was named in Kobach’s lawsuit, told the USDA the state was leery of contributing to a federal database that could be shared with entities not “legally allowed to access that information.”
Kobach said existence of a California lawsuit challenging a federal data request shouldn’t be used by Kelly to justify refusing to cooperate in Kansas. The Kelly administration also endorsed a multistate lawsuit in Massachusetts challenging demands placed on states by the administration of President Donald Trump.
“The idea that a random lawsuit of dubious merit in a distant jurisdiction … somehow allows a governor in another state to refuse to follow the law — that’s crazy,” Kobach said. “Her argument is lawless and absurd.”
Kobach was joined at a news conference by Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi and Hawkins, both Republicans from Wichita.
“The Department for Children and Families must comply with the law and cooperate with the federal government,” Blasi said. “The governor’s refusal to comply with this law jeopardizes benefits for our most needy Kansans.”
Hawkins said he was confounded that the Kelly administration had an elevated error rate in distribution of SNAP benefits.
“The governor is stonewalling,” Hawkins said. “When the secretary refuses to provide the data, she is not only dodging accountability but also breaking the law.”
Kobach said he wanted a district court judge in Shawnee County to expedite the lawsuit to prevent interruption of federal funding earmarked for SNAP. He said the petition submitted to the district court pointed to state law requiring the governor to cooperate in the administration of food stamps and to comply with requests for information on the program. U.S. law sets a system for penalizing states for noncompliance.
“For anyone thinking that the Trump administration is doing this because they just got a wild hair and decided, ‘You know what, let’s go after the states on this.’ No, this is required by federal statute,” the attorney general said.
He asserted Kelly was on the verge of committing a constitutional violation by inviting an avalanche of financial penalties that could eventually deny Kansans access to SNAP.
“It is unclear to me why the governor thinks it’s okay to take food off the table of needy Kansans so that she can demonstrate to the world that she is opposing the Trump administration,” Kobach said. “She has a First Amendment right to say all she wants about the administration in Washington, D.C., but she cannot violate the law and she should never place her desire to perform political theater over the livelihoods of needy Kansans.”
Meanwhile, U.S. Ron Estes and U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, both Kansas Republicans, sent a letter to Kelly urging her to surrender information to USDA about SNAP.
“We are demanding Governor Kelly work with the USDA to strengthen the SNAP program in Kansas and correct the waste of our constituents’ hard-earned dollars,” Estes said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blasi-Kobach-Hawkins-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 19:56:56.885151

Photo by Erick Diaz VelizGenesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, a Democrat running for governor in 2026, on Monday issued a call for peace and humanitarian aid to flow freely in the war between Israel and Hamas-controlled Palestine.
Swanson, in a statement released by his gubernatorial campaign, said seeing children suffering in Gaza as the war rages on “hurts my soul, and I know I’m not alone.”
“For 33 years, I’ve seen people at their very worst moments,” Swanson said. “That’s what I’ve seen in Gaza, and my heart is broken by the desperation and suffering.”
Swanson said that a first step toward a lasting peace must be a ceasefire that enables the immediate delivery of food, medical aid and the release of all hostages.
“I recognize there’s been some effort to help feed and provide emergency supplies, but it’s not even close to enough,” Swanson said. “Air drops are not sufficient. The convoys of aid trucks that sit just miles away must be given immediate access.”
For Swanson, the issue wasn’t about supporting either side in the conflict, and he noted that he deployed Genesee County Sheriff’s Office patrol cars to safeguard worshippers at Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques on Oct. 7, 2023.
“My duty is to protect and serve everyone in my community, no questions asked,” Swanson said. “As I travel the state of Michigan, I hear crushing personal stories from those who have friends and families living in the Middle East. They’re caught in the middle and have no voice. They too want an end to violence and bloodshed. Both sides deserve to live in peace and dignity.”
Swanson is in the Democratic side of the governor’s race alongside Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Marni Sawicki, the former mayor of Cape Coral, Fla. 
The Republican side of the race includes former Michigan attorney general Mike Cox, former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard, former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, William Null and Karla Wagner.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is running as an independent candidate for governor, and will face the eventual winners of the Democratic and Republican primary contests in August of next year.
Three state Democrats call on federal electeds to stand against Israel’s genocide in Gaza
Meanwhile, on Saturday, three Michigan representatives sent a letter to the state’s U.S. senators and its delegation in Congress, urging them to “take a strong stand against Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The letter was authored and signed by state Rep. Alabas Farhat of Dearborn, Rep. Erin Byrnes, also of Dearborn, and Rep. Dylan Wegela of Garden City. It also calls for federal lawmakers to block any additional monetary or military aid, through weapons sales or otherwise, to Israel, and to stand against the U.S. Department of State’s decision to suspend visitor visas for people from Gaza seeking medical treatment.

Farhat, Byrnes and Wegela also indicated that there will be an upcoming resolution introduced by state representatives in the House, calling for an arms embargo against Israel, the full restoration of humanitarian aid, and for U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to provide medical-humanitarian visas to those targeted in what Amnesty International and other scholars have called a genocide in Gaza.
The letter sent Saturday was addressed to U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), as well as U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and the state’s entire congressional delegation.
In response, Peters told Michigan Advance that he has continuously called for the U.S. to negotiate a lasting ceasefire.
“It is the most viable path to ensure desperately needed food and aid reaches innocent civilians in Gaza, secure the release of the remaining hostages, and support peace and stability in the region,” Peters said in a statement to the Advance. “I know this is an issue that deeply impacts a lot of people in our state, and I will continue pushing for an end to this conflict.”
Peters also recently joined a group of his U.S. Senate colleagues in urging the administration of President Donald Trump to resume diplomatic efforts in brokering a Gaza ceasefire – one that ensures a robust expansion of humanitarian aid deliveries to innocent civilians and secures the release of the remaining Israeli hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that started the most recent round of hostilities.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) also responded to a request for comment on the letter, but her office deferred to a statement she made on the war issued in early August.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Water shutoffs are happening earlier than usual for some irrigators in the Yakima River Basin.
Reservoir levels are at the lowest seen since 1971. Non-senior water rights holders in the Yakima basin are expected to receive 40% of their allotment this year, an estimate that has held since August’s meeting, according to a release from the Bureau of Reclamation. Senior water rights holders will continue to receive full allotment.
Storage in the reservoirs on Sept. 1 was 20% full with 218,000 acre-feet of water, or 44% of average.
The Yakima Basin has been in a drought since 2023.
A decline in snowpack and early meltoff, especially this past winter, have led to current conditions. Sometimes called the “sixth reservoir,” snowpack makes up the difference in water supply and allotments. Reclamation’s Yakima Project has about a million acre-feet in storage, but there are about 2.5 million acre-feet in water rights allocated in the basin.
Scott Revell, manager of the Roza Irrigation District, estimates deliveries will end on Sept. 23, about a month earlier than usual.
“It’s better than it could have been. I’m glad that the percentage didn’t drop further,” Revell said.
There wasn’t enough precipitation to help the storage situation this year. April through July rain was a little less than half of average, Revell said, adding, “It’s been terrible.”
The early shutoff has implications for the late harvest crops of the Roza. About two-thirds of the district’s crops, such as apples and wine grapes, are harvested after Sept. 15.
Growers like to “put the crop to bed wet” because a plant’s cold tolerance is diminished when dry, he said. Not having late season water is already a disadvantage for the following growing year.
But Revell looks at bright spots in challenging years like this one, such as the conservation efforts taken and strong relationship the district has with the Bureau of Reclamation.
The Bureau of Reclamation saw staff cuts at the start of the year, but “they did a really good job keeping everybody up to speed,” Revell said, including giving mid-month updates so that districts can adjust and plan accordingly. “Our communications with the Bureau are very strong.”
The Kittitas Reclamation District shut off on Aug. 13, about two months early, because of the lack of water. The Ellensburg-based district supplies water for hay and tree fruit growers.
District Manager Urban Eberhart said that the year was “tremendously difficult” for the district’s growers.
Kittitas Reclamation District and Roza Irrigation District are working with state agencies and Washington State University on a study to better understand the impacts to production and quality of crops in multiyear droughts, Eberhart said.

Lab officials will be allowed to release a radioactive gas into the air as soon as this fall, following approval from state environment officials on Sept. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Los Alamos National Laboratory)New Mexico environment officials on Monday gave permission for Los Alamos National Laboratory to vent a radioactive gas within the next six months.
The decision came on the heels of federal officials urging the state in a recent letter to make a decision, and pushback from anti-nuclear and Indigenous groups about the proposal.
Specifically, LANL aims to vent four waste containers filled with tritium and hazardous waste that it packed in 2007 and left at the lab’s disposal site, called Area G. In 2016, LANL officials discovered the drums were building pressure and could potentially explode. In a worst-case scenario modeled for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency —  which the lab said was unlikely — a rupture of all four containers could expose people to a dosage of 20 millirem, double the airborne radiation limit that LANL is allowed to release for all operations for a whole year.
Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear research. The EPA characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin, and is only considered hazardous in large quantities from inhalation, skin absorption or consumed in tritiated water – a replacement of one of the hydrogen molecules with tritium.
Rick Shean, Resource Protection Division director for the New Mexico Environment Department, told Source NM that state officials and U.S. Environmental and Protection Agency officials will be onsite during the planned venting across 12 to 16 days during weekends.
“We will be there, us and the EPA, [so] if something does go wrong, there’s a discussion with [U.S. Department of Energy] that we can observe,” Shean said. “We’ll step in and stop it if we have to.”
Among several provisions in a Sept. 8 letter from the environment department to the National Nuclear Security Administration and the lab’s contractor, environment officials will require LANL to keep the release below 6 millirems as a “hard stop limit,” which is lower than the 8 millirems LANL proposed. Shean noted that a typical release of tritium throughout the year from the lab is between zero to 1.5 milirems.
Indigenous groups including Tewa Women United, Honor our Pueblo Existence and anti-nuclear groups have raised concerns that federal limits for tritium exposure levels of a of 10 millirem were based on men, not pregnant women or young children.
Shean said the department’s mandate takes the concern raised by the groups into consideration.
“We do understand the concern around thresholds being put out there, the standards being based on typically male adults,” he said. “That was one of the reasons guiding our decision to lower the threshold to this event to six milirems.”
In addition to the concerns about exposure levels, anti-nuclear activists and Indigenous groups also recently raised objections about what they described as restrictions on public participation and transparency at a recent meeting on the proposal. The state environment department previously set four conditions for NNSA and Triad to meet for approval, including a public meeting and tribal consultations.
The Sept. 8 letter concludes with an admonishment from state officials, saying the operation is necessary because of LANL’s “failure to properly manage hazardous waste at the time of generation followed by almost a 20-year disregard of compliance obligations under state laws and rules,” the letter said.
In a statement Monday, National Nuclear Security Administration Public Affairs Specialist Toni Chiri said laboratory officials will be in contact with Congressional, state, local and tribal governments to release the dates for the tritium venting expected this fall and will ensure the venting does not overlap with Pueblo Feast days or other events.
“This operation will be conducted with the utmost considerations for safety to LANL employees, the surrounding communities, and the environment,” Chiri said. “LANL engineers have done careful analysis of the controlled depressurization process and will monitor it in real-time to ensure safety.”
Emails requesting comment from the nearby Pueblos of San Ildefonso and Santa Clara went unreturned as of publication.
Joni Ahrends, executive director at Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, called the release a “pattern of practice,” saying that LANL has been contaminating air, land and water in the more than 80 years since the Manhattan Project.
“Who’s going to pay the price? The people of Northern New Mexico,” she said. “And there’s never an answer to the question: ‘when is it going to stop?’”

(Photo by Alicia Stearns/U.S. Forest Service)In 2001, the United States recognized the environmental, economic and cultural significance of over 58 million acres at the heart of our national forests and granted them additional protections known as the Roadless Rule. 
Last month, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced plans to advance reversing the Roadless Rule, which would open millions of acres of federal lands to industrial development. The U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz falsely claimed that America’s flourishing national forests are “dangerously overstocked.” Reversing the Roadless Rule would open up 9.3 million acres of the Tongass National Forest, and 5.4 million acres of the Chugach National Forest to development, allowing for roads and structures that will have negative impacts that could last many lifetimes. 
Contrary to what Trump administration officials believe, if the Tongass, Chugach, and other national forests are “overstocked,” then society has a cultural and economic responsibility to keep it that way. 
For thousands of years, the Tongass National Forest has provided for the people and wildlife who have lived below its canopies and along its shorelines. National forests are managed to create optimal resources for uses including fishing, logging, subsistence and sport hunting. The lands protected by the Roadless Rule are the delicate habitats that allow the rest of the forests to thrive. 
Resource development, while sometimes necessary, almost inevitably changes or destroys habitats essential to the flora and fauna humans depend on. The nutrients from the forests are responsible for the health of the waters that make up our fisheries, which contributes more than $6 billion annually to Alaska’s economy. Tourism from the Inside Passage through the Tongass National Forest contributes to an estimated $5.6 billion in economic output for Alaska each year. National forests are also vital to recreation such as sport fishing and hunting. The elimination of the Roadless Rule would immediately impact the ways we are able to feed ourselves and our children. 
Reversing the Roadless Rule will not only damage the economy Alaskans depend on, but threaten thousands of years of heritage. Since time immemorial generations of Alaska Natives have thrived based on the health of the forests. So far, several resolutions have been passed, including by the Organized Village of Kasaan, the Organized Village of Kake, and the Hoonah Indian Association, amongst others, supporting the Roadless Rule. As former President Bill Clinton noted when the protection was enacted, the vital ecosystems leave an inheritance for our children and our grandchildren. An inheritance that local leaders have long stewarded.
With a government focused on putting profits over people, it is no surprise that Sec. Rollins would prefer to use the 58 million acres for short term commercial interests. The American public should be outraged at the prospect of tarnishing our national forests and potentially depleting their resources forever. The national forests are not “overstocked” – they are performing a vital function to support our everyday livelihoods. 
By disturbing the delicate ecosystems at the hearts of our national forests we would be denying future generations a vital inheritance. Americans will instead be left with destroyed lands, dirty air, soiled waterways, and depleted resources.
As the public comment period for the Roadless Rule revision comes to a close on September 19, we all have the opportunity to speak out to continue to protect the national forests of Alaska and across the country for the sake of our environment, economy and our heritage.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/52503189645_4f1b6a490c_o-1024x589.jpg,,,2025-09-08 18:57:17.221821

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An online education program serving 33,500 public school students is at risk of running out of money and closing next year unless the Oklahoma Legislature adds more funding, state officials say.
State funding dropped to zero this fiscal year for the Horizon Digitally Enhanced Campus, which offers free online Advanced Placement classes and other virtual courses at discounted rates to Oklahoma school districts.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which is in charge of Horizon, said it will ask the Legislature for a $3.4 million supplemental funding package to restore the program’s budget when lawmakers convene their 2026 session in February. 
The head of the board, Brian Shellem, said lawmakers told him the lack of funding was the result of an “oversight.”
But, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, who leads two Senate committees on education, gave a different explanation.

He said the Legislature initially was told Horizon needed only a one-time appropriation in fiscal year 2025. That’s why the current state budget for fiscal year 2026 dedicated no further funding.
State lawmakers likely will be on board with providing supplemental dollars to keep the program going, Pugh said.
“What I’ve been told is that (Horizon) is a very good resource,” he said. “I haven’t experienced it myself, but if that is the case, that’s a good thing, and I think that’s something the Legislature would absolutely be interested in continuing.”
Shellem said the program is currently operating on cash reserves, but if it doesn’t receive more funds, Horizon won’t be able to exist in the 2026-27 academic year.
He said the board and its staff hope lawmakers approve a supplemental funding package as soon as February.
“We hope it’s one of the very first things that they take care of,” Shellem said. “Every legislator I’ve talked to understands the need, especially as you’ve seen the growth with all these small and rural districts.”

Horizon’s catalog of online courses includes 58 classes, including 26 for AP credit, taught by in-house instructors available to public schools for free.
Horizon also contracts with third-party education vendors to provide hundreds more course options that students can request through their public school.
Out of the 509 school districts in Oklahoma, 380 use the Horizon Consortium to collectively negotiate with these vendors for cheaper prices to provide the courses. Students then take these classes at no cost. 
Districts saved $3.69 million this fiscal year with the discounted rates, a greater amount than Horizon’s requested budget, according to the statewide board’s staff.
A supplemental funding package from the Legislature would provide needed money before the next fiscal year begins, so Horizon can execute vendor contracts in the spring for the following school year and accommodate the program’s significant growth, staff said.
Demand began growing exponentially last school year once a state law took effect requiring all public high schools to provide at least four AP classes. 
More than 33,500 students take online classes through third-party vendors or are enrolled in Horizon’s own courses. In 2022, the program served 7,211 students.
Pugh said he’s not surprised the program now needs a supplemental funding package.
“That means it’s an in-demand resource, and the kids are getting services,” Pugh said. “And I think that’s a win that we should be happy about.”

A Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles working group is poised to examine portions of the state’s towing law that range far beyond its original mandate, potentially leading to more extensive reforms than those passed by the legislature last session. 
The 10-member committee, which met for the first time Monday, must report its recommendations to lawmakers by February. It was originally tasked with examining a piece of the Connecticut law that requires proceeds from sales of towed cars to be remitted to the state, but members said they also want to study the way vehicles are valued by towing companies and other aspects of the sales process. 
The committee, which is chaired by DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera, includes three tow company owners, two consumer advocates and other DMV officials. At its first meeting, the group discussed several issues still plaguing the towing industry even after the legislature overhauled the state’s more than 100-year-old law in May.
The legislation passed with bipartisan support following reporting from The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica which revealed that Connecticut allows tow truck companies to start the sales process in 15 days on cars valued under $1,500, one of the shortest windows in the country. The stories also explained how this and other laws favored towing companies at the expense of low-income residents.
The bill, which will take effect Oct. 1, requires towing companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or are parked in a handicapped accessible spot.
Under the bill, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but they will now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle and the actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
The bill also created the working group to study the remittance mandate in state law. Under that law, towing companies can sell a vehicle if the owner doesn’t reclaim it, but they are required to hold onto the proceeds for a year so the vehicle owner can claim the money. If the owner never comes forward, companies are required to turn over the proceeds to the state after subtracting their fees. 
Earlier this year, Guerrera told lawmakers the DMV never set up a system for this process to occur and wasn’t aware of any money being remitted to the state by towers. He said the DMV has been reviewing the issue and that the committee would be prepared to address it in the report.
Guerrera said Monday that the working group should expand its mission to study broader changes that make it easier for low-income residents to get their cars back.
“There’s got to be a way, too, to make sure that people know what’s going on when their car gets towed,” Guerrera said. “That’s important because that $1,000 vehicle is a lifeline for them, and they need to get it back. So how can we get it back in a way that doesn’t keep accumulating more fees?”
Committee members discussed creating a new way to monitor who actually owns a vehicle by having DMV require the owner to submit a record of sale. Currently, towers try to reach the last registered owner of the vehicle after they tow it but that process is not reliable because when people buy cars they aren’t always registered right away. The new legislation does allow the vehicle owner to submit a title or bill of sale instead of a registration to get their car back.
“A huge part of the problem is the fact that we can’t get a hold of the owner of the vehicle. People are buying a car, they don’t register them, it gets towed, and everything’s going back to the last person that owned it a few years ago,” said Sal Sena, owner of Sena Brothers and Cross Country Automotive in Hartford.

The committee also tackled several other issues, such as developing a standardized form to determine the value of a car that has been towed.
“How do the towers … come up with a value of a vehicle based upon that, especially for under $1,500?” Guerrera asked. “If it’s borderline, I’m saying, if you’ve got a car that’s three grand or four grand, next thing you know, it’s valued under $1,500. How did that happen?”
A wide-ranging discussion ensued on how to inform people when their vehicle is towed and whether to raise the threshold number for the 15-day sale from $1,500 to $2,000. 
Connecticut Legal Services attorney Rafie Podolsky said how the towers value the cars has long been an issue for consumers.
“We’ve had a long-standing concern about the way in which motor vehicles are disposed of,” Podolsky said. “We’ve had a fair amount of experience with car owners who’ve been unable to get the cars back for a variety of reasons. I’m hopeful that either the department or the industry will have data that will allow us to kind of make some comparisons between the presumed value of the car, the dollar amount that comes in on a resale and even what happens after resale.”

Towing company representatives said another priority should be modernizing the DMV’s process for getting permission to sell someone’s vehicle. 
Eileen Colonese of Farmington Motor Sports said they spend weeks sending paperwork back and forth through the mail to DMV and vehicle owners.
“There’s portals out there for all kinds of things. Why is there not a portal for this?” Colonese said. “Everyone can submit everything electronically and have access to a more standardized and modernized system.”
The working group  must submit a report to the legislature’s Transportation Committee by February and Guerrera said it’s important to produce something that all members support.
“If we go to the legislature with a piece of information that says we have met with the industry on both sides, and this is what we’ve come up with, we’re in good shape,” Guerrera said. “If we bog down now again, you know, now it’s in the hands of the legislature and we don’t know what could happen.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0908_SR_TowingMeetingDMV_106-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 18:57:17.221821

Jeffrey Ramon Diaz, 43, of Roswell, will face up to 10 years in prison following his guilty plea last month to four counts of “malicious threat to injure by fire or explosive,” according to Tessa Duberry, a spokesperson for the United States Attorney’s Office of New Mexico, in a news release.
Prosecutors said Diaz identified himself by name, after calling himself “perdido,” or “lost” in Spanish, before threatening in phone calls Feb. 14 to light on fire or bomb offices of a United States senator, New Mexico Second Judicial District Court, the Doña Ana County Magistrate Court and the Pennsylvania governor.

While court documents do not identify individuals Diaz admitted to threatening, the criminal complaint lists a phone number for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) as one of the numbers Diaz called. 
In the plea agreement Diaz signed, he admitted that he called the Bernalillo county courthouse and directed the following threat toward a judge: “I stated, amongst other threats, ‘that I am threatening you, l am threatening your [expletive] life…and your building, I am going to blow you [expletive] up, I’m going to set you on fire.”
The other threats Diaz admitted to were similar, according to court documents. Diaz did not have any bombs, according to prosecutors, but “made the threats intending to cause fear, panic, and intimidation,” according to a news release.

Rick Rose resigned as head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and as state chief operating officer, a post he held since August 2024, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday. His resignation is effective Sept. 26.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond last week sent Stitt a letter accusing Rose of “refusing to process a statutorily authorized transaction for my office – presumably at your instruction.”
Rose refused to process the purchase of vehicles for agents in his office, Drummond wrote.
“His stated reason for doing so is that I have not responded to an unrelated inquiry from his office seeking information he already has,” Drummond wrote.
Drummond asked Stitt to remove Rose from office if he was not acting on a request from Stitt. Drummond said if the action came at Stitt’s request, the governor’s actions “represent a serious misuse of your authority, causing direct harm to the ability of my law enforcement agents to do their job.”
The Office of Management and Enterprise Services handles a number of functions for state agencies and offices, including finance, human resources and information technology.
Drummond’s office provided the letter shortly after Stitt announced that Rose was leaving office.    
Drummond asked Stitt to take immediate action to resolve the matter.
Stitt’s office and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In an Aug. 18 letter received by Drummond, Rose asked the agency to fill out a form with questions about why the office’s staffing had increased since 2019. It was not clear how many offices and agencies received the letter.
The questionnaire indicated the Attorney General’s Office had a staffing level of 201 in 2019, a figure which rose to 321 currently. The Oklahoma Legislature over the years has assigned the office additional responsibilities.
Drummond, who is running for governor,  became attorney general on Jan. 9, 2023, after defeating John M. O’Connor, who Stitt tapped to replace Mike Hunter, who resigned.
Rose previously served as chief of staff and special counsel to former Oklahoma House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, who termed out and is running for governor.
Drummond said he believes his letter to Stitt played a role in Rose’s departure.
Stitt and Drummond have disagreed on  numerous issues, including the use of state dollars for a Catholic charter school, tribal relations and dual-office holding.

Free.,Democrats share alleged Trump birthday note to Epstein,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-share-alleged-trump-birthday-note-epstein,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Democrats on Monday revealed a lewd image and inscription they alleged was a birthday note that President Donald Trump provided for the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday book compiled by the financier’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led by Kentucky Republican James Comer, obtained the drawing via a subpoena for records in the government’s 2019 federal sex trafficking case against Epstein.“We got the Epstein note Trump says doesn’t exist. Time to end this White House cover-up,” Rep. Robert Garcia of California wrote on social media. Garcia is the top ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee. Comer had not issued a comment or statement as of late Monday afternoon on social media or on the committee’s website, where the committee chair has been posting updates on the Epstein probe.The image of the birthday note shows a cryptic message about a “wonderful secret” written within the outline of a woman’s body and breasts. A doodle depicting the name “Donald” — that appears similar to Trump’s signature — is placed in the location of the woman’s pubic hair. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the birthday message in July. Trump promptly sued the news outlet and denied that he created the note.The Journal also published the image Wednesday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement on social media Wednesday criticizing the news outlet’s latest story as a “hatchet job” and asserting that the president’s lawyers “will continue to aggressively pursue litigation.”“The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire ‘Birthday Card’ story is false. As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,” Leavitt wrote on X.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries declined to comment on the birthday note at a previously scheduled press conference Monday afternoon.Trump’s past relationship with Epstein has been under a microscope since the Department of Justice declared in July it would not be releasing any further information on the case, and that no incriminating client list of Epstein’s existed.Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019, awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors.Trump campaigned on releasing what he and his followers call the ""Epstein files.”The uproar over the investigative materials related to the government’s case has revealed a rupture among Trump’s voter base and some House Republicans who have reliably supported him.Victims who shared stories of abuse inflicted by Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted on federal charges of sex trafficking minors, stood alongside Democrats and Republicans, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, on Capitol Hill Sept. 2.Massie’s discharge petition, co-led with Rep.

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.
The calls may come from teens hiding inside high school bathroom stalls, from overwhelmed parents or from widows or widowers now living alone..  
But all Rhode Islanders who call 988, the federally run crisis number that went live on July 16, 2022, really need someone to talk to.
Rhode Island callers have a wait time of about 1.9 seconds on average to reach a trained counselor, the lowest nationwide according to state officials.
“Although every call is different, our goal remains the same,” Stephanie Clifford, a clinical supervisor at Rhode Island’s 988 hotline center, said at a Monday morning press event at the State House. “To provide hope, validation and a path forward for each caller beyond the crisis.”
Clifford joined a long roster of state leaders and a former New England Patriot and two-time Superbowl champion to commemorate 988 Day and Rhode Island’s robust uptake of the suicide prevention and crisis help hotline. The free-to-call program was designed as an easy-to-remember alternative to the previous 1-800 number for callers in crisis. The service’s nationally scaffolded network of help centers connects callers via phone, text or chat to state-funded, local crisis centers, where counselors can provide referrals, resources or simple conversation to ease a troubled mind. 
Clifford offered an anecdotal picture for the crowd: “An elderly woman in her late 80s will call for the first time on a Sunday afternoon, her voice soft and apologetic, ‘I’m sorry to bother you. I just haven’t spoken to anyone in three days.’ Or an older gentleman who’s deeply grieving, telling a counselor, ‘I just wanted to hear another voice.’”
Rhode Island’s 988 center — which is based in East Providence, right near the Seekonk, Massachusetts, border — has received 28,582 calls since it went live in 2022. Another 35,745 calls were forwarded to the call center by predecessor 414-LINK, making for a total of 64,327 calls answered by the call center since its inception. Nearly all calls that originate in Rhode Island — 98% — are answered by in-state operators.
In the past 12 months, the lowest number of calls received was 768, in April.
Those callers aren’t always experiencing suicidal thoughts or wishes to harm themselves, although suicidal thinking does appear in 53% of callers according to state data. (According to state data, that metric was first collected in Jan. 2023.)
Emceeing Monday’s event was Margie O’Brien, the director of RI Capitol TV, the state-run broadcasting service which thoroughly covers all happenings at the State House. In her opening remarks, O’Brien recalled using the 411 directory assistance number as a “tween” growing up in Natick, Massachusetts,  a simple phone call opened up a world of information.
“You could dial it on your rotary phone, and you could get the phone number of that cute boy in your science class or an address for your parents to drop you off at a birthday party this weekend,” O’Brien said.
The 988 hotline, O’Brien emphasized, can be an even sturdier lifeline for people in need. and an accessible one, added U.S. Sen. Jack Reed in his turn at the podium. Reed, who helped spearhead the legislation that created the national hotline, characterized the service as one example of a wise adage gleaned from his military days: “KISS,” or, “Keep it simple, stupid.”
The previous crisis hotline number, Reed said, was “a 1-800 something, something, something no one can remember, particularly in a crisis.”
Reed praised the tiniest state for having the highest answer rate in the country. He then took a broader stance to swing at President Donald Trump’s administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as examples of what not to do when it comes to mental health funding, especially for LGBTQ+ youth.
In July, the Trump administration ended the LGBTQ-specific counseling option that allowed callers to press “3” when dialing 988.
“Now, if it’s not bad enough, Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. —  and I emphasize ‘Junior’ — has proposed eliminating SAMHSA, that’s the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Agency,” Reed said. “We’re going to take out the experts in the federal government and just let everyone go their own way, I suppose.”
Reed thought it ironic that Trump — who signed the 2020 law creating the 988 hotline — is now presiding over cuts that threaten its reach, which he dubbed “cheap political gimmicks.”
The “Press 3” option that once connected callers to national counselors specializing in LGBTQIA+ youth issues remains disconnected in Rhode Island, confirmed Karen Jeffreys, a spokesperson for Horizon Healthcare Partners, the consortium of agencies that coordinates the 988 network in Rhode Island.
Those calls are now routed directly to Rhode Island’s crisis counselors, Jeffreys said, and staff have undergone additional training to support LGBTQ+ youth. Counselors can also refer young people to the Trevor Project hotline, Jeffreys added.
Gov. Dan McKee, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo, and Rhode Island Senate President Valarie Lawson also attended the event, with everyone except Matos, who had to leave early, speaking to the crowd. Rep. Joseph Solomon Jr., a Warwick Democrat, attended and spoke on behalf of House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi.

Men wanted
In Rhode Island, the 988 service has seen a 212% increase in calls since its inception. O’Brien construed that as a positive, and told the audience it translates to more people being willing to seek help when they need it most. To close out the event, O’Brien proposed a challenge: Tell three friends about 988, one for each digit in the number.
“Just like the Fabergé shampoo commercial from yesteryear,” O’Brien said. “Hopefully they will tell three friends and so on and so on and so on, and the word will get out that help is available.”
Also speaking at the event with hopes of evangelizing to new crowds was Tully Banta-Cain, the former New England Patriots linebacker. After he strode to the podium, Banta-Cain took in the opulent surroundings of the State Room and commented, “This place is beautiful,” said Banta-Cain, who is a member of the Horizon Healthcare Foundation. 
He encouraged the audience to think of 988 as a teammate they can call when “things get tough.” Football has long been his stress relief, he told the crowd, which is why he started the Beach Football League to give athletes and young people an outlet.
“No matter how strong or successful someone may look on the outside,” Banta-Cain cautioned, “wWe all face challenges on the inside. That’s why resources like 988 are so important. Just like we train our bodies, we have to train and take care of our minds.”
Darrell Waldron of the Rhode Island Indian Council also emphasized the room’s lavish decorations, albeit in a different way. He motioned at the portraits of “men of war” lining the State Room, and linked the omnipresence of war in American history to generations of “suppressed historical trauma” and its present day toll on Native communities.
“Every Native event that I’ve been involved with, there’s someone or many who have a family member [who] died of suicide,” Waldron said.
Waldron also pointed out that there weren’t many men in the State Room Monday morning. The 60-something chairs and standing room were mostly packed with women, Waldron observed. 
“Men need to get involved,” he said, calling it “difficult to get men into mental health.”

The U.S. House last week passed a resolution overturning Biden-era restrictions on resource extraction across millions of acres in eastern Montana, bringing Montana’s all-Republican delegation closer to stated goals of bolstering the state’s mining and energy sectors.
But conservation groups said the change — which needs approval in the U.S. Senate — reverses environmental gains and ignores local stakeholders
House Joint Resolution 104, carried by the state’s eastern Congressman, Rep. Troy Downing, passed on near-partisan lines, with all but one Republican in favor and all Democrats opposed.
“The Biden Administration’s outright ban on coal leasing in the Powder River Basin is an intolerable threat to domestic energy production, U.S. national security, and the prosperity of the communities I represent,” Downing said in a statement. “I’m proud to be leading the charge in the House to reverse the Miles City Field Office RMPA to improve access to the affordable, reliable energy that brings the American dream that much closer to hand for countless families in Montana and across the country. I appreciate the support and advocacy of my colleagues from the Treasure State in this fight, and I look forward to seeing this resolution pass the Senate and signed into law by President Trump.”
All four of Montana’s congressional delegates, all Republicans, support the resolution, with Sen. Steve Daines sponsoring companion legislation in the upper chamber. Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy are cosponsors on their chambers’ respective bills.
The Miles City Resource Management Plan amendment prohibited future coal leasing in the Miles City field office district.
The bill was one of three passed by the House last Wednesday rescinding resource management plans on nearly 30 million acres of public land in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska.
Downing’s legislation overturns a rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management that halted future coal leasing on roughly 1.7 million acres of federal land in Montana’s Powder River Basin, which contains roughly a third of the nation’s coal reserves.
The record of decision for the Miles City Resource Management Plan amendment, released last November, provided for existing leases at two mines — Spring Creek and Rosebud — to continue for at least a decade, but the bureau said the rule came following analysis that coal markets would continue to decline and coal-fired plants were likely to close or be converted to utilize renewable energy.
“The approved RMP Amendment makes unavailable 1,745,040 acres of BLM administered coal from further consideration for leasing in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a proxy for climate change. The BLM would not accept new coal lease applications,” the decision said.
Last year the Bureau of Land Management said in 2022, the two mines had produced about two-thirds the coal they produced in 2007.
Meanwhile, the federal government earlier this year authorized an expansion for the Westmoreland Rosebud Mine, which fuels the Colstrip power plant, allowing it to extract roughly 70 million tons of coal and operate through 2039.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. coal production to drop from 610 million tons in 2022 to 450 million tons in 2040, and Western U.S. production to drop from 335 million tons to 224 million tons over the same period.
Coal taxes in Montana benefit public education in the state, with money going into a trust that funds public school construction and upgrades, infrastructure projects, housing and economic development, among other things.
In a letter sent to the Trump administration, Gov. Greg Gianforte urged the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana to benefit national security, provide reliable energy and boost Montana’s educational systems.
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.
While industry groups and Montana politicians praised the passage of the bill conservation groups decried the move as a step backwards for environmental protections and criticized Congress’ vote as a workaround of the federal rule-making process.
“Congress just jumped head first down a slippery slope that creates a dangerous precedent that will surely backfire. Using the Congressional Review Act not only repeals the current management plan, which was carefully crafted by local leaders and stakeholders, but it puts at risk future efforts to responsibly manage public lands. It’s not just wildlife habitat and hunting and fishing access at risk here; it’s all decisions made at the local level,” said Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation, in a statement. “At a time when Montana’s public lands are facing numerous threats, land managers need flexibility and tools to respond, not more interference from Washington.”
Justin Meuse, government relations director at The Wilderness Society, said Congress was overturning decisions over land management in an “unprecedented way” and could expose “thousands of permits, leases and rights of way to legal challenge.”
But Daines emphasized that Montana’s economy was at the forefront of his decision to back the move.
“Joe Biden’s Miles City RMPA halts all future coal leasing in the region and will cause hardworking Montanans to lose their jobs,” Daines said in a statement. “It will also stifle our state’s growing economy and increase our dependence on foreign nations for coal and energy production. It’s critical that we remove this outdated and harmful plan.”
Downing’s office said overturning the resource management plan will keep roughly $46 million in coal tax revenue secure and generate $15 million in new federal energy revenue.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DBleizeffer-coal-haul-truck-BT-1-1-e1734111827905.jpg,,,2025-09-08 17:57:57.690604

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Two more Republican candidates, Joe Mitchell and Christian Schlaefer, have declared their campaigns for congressional seats in Iowa.
The GOP primary race for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District opened up last week when incumbent U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson entered the 2026 U.S. Senate race after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she would not seek reelection.
Following Hinson’s announcement, several Republicans expressed interest in running for the now open seat, including former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum and Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta. State Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, officially announced his campaign for the position Sep. 4, writing in a social media post, “as one of Iowa’s first endorsers of President Trump and supporters for his reelection campaign, I understand the Republican platform and the importance of an America First agenda.”
On Monday, Joe Mitchell joined the primary field. Mitchell, a former state lawmaker and the founder of Run Gen Z, a young conservative organization, most recently worked for the Trump administration as a regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He also previously served as chief of staff at the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

In a statement on his campaign website, Mitchell said he is running for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District because “too many Iowans have been left behind by a broken political system that works for insiders and lobbyists, not for us.” He said he would work to lower government spending and support President Donald Trump if elected.
“For too long, politicians in Washington have wasted our tax dollars and cut backroom deals while working families pay the price,” Mitchell said. “I’ll work with President Trump to end reckless spending, secure our borders, protect our farmers, and build an economy where hard work pays again. It’s time to take power back from the insiders and return it to the people of Iowa — where it belongs.”
But Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Katie Smith said Mitchell himself was a “Des Moines insider and career politician.”
“He’s just the latest in what’s going to be a long line of out-of-touch Republicans running in Iowa’s 2nd district and fighting over who will best cater to Washington special interests and billionaires,” Smith said in a statement. “We’re going to flip this seat because Iowans are ready for someone who takes on business-as-usual to lower families’ costs and put their communities first.”
There are currently three Democrats running for the seat — state Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, Matthew 25 Founder  Clint Twedt-Ball and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
Christian Schlaefer enters 4th District GOP primary, calls for debate
In Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, a new Republican entered the race. Christian Schlaefer, a 29-year-old software consultant from Lakota, launched his campaign for the GOP nomination Saturday at the Clay County Fair. He and his wife have a homestead farm, and he also serves as a firefighter and guest preacher in his community.
Schlaefer said in a news release that he is running for the seat in 2026 to “preserve American values” through conservative policies.
“I’m not a career politician. I am just a farmer and workingman with passion for Iowa and the American People,” Schlaefer said in a statement. “It’s time we restore small-town America — built by Main Street and the Church — and fight for what it truly means to be an American.”
He is joining a crowded GOP primary field for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who has an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor. Among the Republican candidates running to succeed Feenstra are former Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan, farmer and land appraiser Kyle Larsen and Iowa Tea Party Founder Ryan Rhodes.
Schlaefer called for a GOP primary debate to narrow the field.
“There are five candidates in this race,” Schlaefer said. “That’s too many. Rather than wasting time and money of everyday Iowans, I ask that they join me in debate — so the People, not political consultants, decide who can best carry their voice to Washington.”
Two Democrats — Ashley Wolf Tornabane and Stephanie Steiner — have also announced their campaigns for the 4th Congressional District, which is considered a longtime conservative stronghold.

Rep. Fiona McFarland, representing part of Sarasota county, is the new chair of the Information Technology Budget and Policy Subcommittee, the only subcommittee touching policy and budget.
Rep. John Snyder, representing parts of Martin and Palm Beach counties, previously served as chair of that subcommittee. Rep. Kevin Steele remains vice chair.

The Agriculture and Natural Resources Subcommittee will now be led by Snyder. Previously, it was led by Rep. Tiffany Esposito.
Since Republicans control the chamber, all of the new chairs belong to that party.

Non-budget committee switch-ups include Rep. Berny Jacques, representing part of Pinellas County, who previously chaired the Careers and Workforce Subcommittee; now he will chair the Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee. Esposito picked up the Careers and Workforce Subcommittee chair vacated by Jacques.
With Rep. Alex Rizo handing the Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee gavel to Jacques, he will now chair the Student Academic Success Subcommittee. McFarland has been chair of that panel.
Two of the higher-profile panels, the Budget Committee and Health Care Budget Subcommittee, will keep the same leadership. The Health Care Budget Subcommittee chaired by Rep. Alex Andrade was the venue for the probe into Hope Florida. Rep. Lawrence McClure will remain Budget Committee chair.
The Health Professions and Programs Subcommittee chair will remain Rep. Kaylee Tuck, but the new vice chair is Rep. Robbie Brackett. Vice chair was previously Rep. John Temple.
The Higher Education Budget Subcommittee chair will still be Rep. Demi Busatta. She will have a new vice chair in Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman. Former Rep. Mike Caruso was the vice chair, but he left the House after Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him as Palm Beach County court clerk.
Rep. Chip LaMarca was chair of Joint Legislative Auditing committee. Now, Rep. Randy Maggard will help chair that joint House-Senate committee.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the past two years, Rhode Island League of Women Voters volunteers have helped over 1,700 new American citizens register to vote at weekly naturalization ceremonies at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Johnston.
“It’s a routine,” Christine Stenning, president of the Newport League of Women Voters, said in an interview Monday. “And it seems to work.”
But when volunteers arrived at the Johnston office the morning after Labor Day, they were told the Trump administration had ended their routine. A new policy quietly enacted the Friday before the holiday weekend prohibits all nongovernmental groups from registering voters at naturalization ceremonies.
The new rule, issued Aug. 29 by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), leaves voter registration duties at naturalization ceremonies solely with state and local election officials.
“We didn’t know about it,” Stenning said. “This happened over that weekend — it’s almost as if this was intentional from the administration.”
In a two-page memo on the new policy, the USCIS wrote that the change was made as part of its aims to make administrative naturalization ceremonies “positive and memorable moments” in the lives of the participants.
“USCIS does not believe that aliens or nongovernmental organizations have any reliance interests related to representatives of nongovernmental organizations being present at naturalization ceremonies,” the memo states.
The agency claimed that use of nongovernmental organizations for voter registration at naturalization ceremonies was “sporadic and varied based upon the location” and that ​​ensuring the groups are nonpartisan was an administrative “burden.”
A USCIS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what those burdens entail.
The agency’s memo also states the change “in no way impacts new citizens’ access to information and applications to register to vote” because those materials will still be provided by local election officials or USCIS staff.
The state offers several ways for new residents to register — including automatic registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles, online and mail-in applications, or in person at local boards of canvassers. But not all new citizens may be aware of those options, said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island.
“It’s unbelievable that they’ve decided they should kick the League of Women voters of all groups out of doing that,” he said in an interview.
Marion said as far as he was aware, only league volunteers have set up voter registration assistance at the Johnston USCIS office.
Stenning said keeping groups like hers out of naturalization ceremonies undermines democracy.
“This is a step toward stopping peoples’ voting rights,” she said. “This is not just going to hit Rhode Island, this is going to hit the entire United States.”
Secretary of State Gregg Amore too was disappointed by the Trump administration’s decision, chief of staff LeeAnn Byrne said in an email.
“The Rhode Island League of Women Voters have been excellent partners in registering new voters, both at naturalization ceremonies and other events,” Byrne wrote.










It’s unbelievable that they’ve decided they should kick the League of Women voters of all groups out of doing that.


– John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island


Naturalization ceremonies are typically held weekly at the USCIS’s Johnston office and monthly at the federal courthouse in downtown Providence. They’ve also happened at the Roger Williams National Memorial, half a mile up the road from the courthouse.
On average, 100 new citizens and their family members attend naturalization ceremonies at the Providence park, said Park Ranger Kevin Klyberg. So far, he said, park rangers have not received any guidance on who is allowed to attend.
“It’s everyone’s park,” he said. “So anyone who wants to come by can come on by.”
Ceremonies themselves typically last an hour and are public events at which individuals who have undergone the process of becoming citizens take their oath of allegiance and typically could then apply for their U.S. passport and register to vote, Marcela Betancur, executive director of the Latino Policy Institute in Providence said in an interview.
Betancur said she was very concerned that the new federal rule creates a barrier to the ballot for new Rhode Islanders.
“If as a country we want to ensure that individuals are here and American citizens, then why wouldn’t we want them to be registered to vote?” she said.
The state offers several ways for new residents to register — including automatic registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles, online and mail-in applications, or in person at local boards of canvassers. But not all new citizens may be aware of those options, Marion said.
Byrne said the Secretary of State’s office is in communication with the Rhode Island Board of Elections and the Johnston Board of Canvassers to ensure new citizens know where to register to vote following their ceremony at the Atwood Avenue location. 
“But, Secretary Amore hopes the Trump Administration will reverse its decision and allow trusted nonpartisan organizations to resume offering this service,” Byrne added.
Stenning said she hoped to see solutions as soon as possible. One idea she floated was having the Secretary of State’s office deputize league volunteers as official election workers. 
Byrne said the office has not considered the idea as of Monday, adding doing so may be complicated as there are strict definitions for election workers, who generally are employed full time by the state or as poll workers.
“I don’t know if we could say that off the top of our heads, but that’s an interesting idea,” she said.

The bill passed largely along partisan lines, with five Republicans voting in opposition. It needs to be approved by the House one more time before heading to the Senate. If it passes that chamber, it goes on the ballot for voter approval.
Under the proposal, constitutional amendments put on the ballot by voters would need a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts to pass. This means that a small percentage of the state’s voters could defeat any ballot measure. 
During last year’s general election, 311,915 votes were cast in the 1st District out of the state’s 2,960,266 votes. So 156,000 voters — or about 5.3% of the statewide vote — could prevent a measure from passing.
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

Constitutional amendments placed on the ballot by state lawmakers would not have the same standard. Only citizen-led initiative petitions would be affected.
The bill initially also targeted changes to state law placed on the ballot through the initiative petition process. But the proposal’s sponsor — Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis of Moberly — said during Monday’s debate that he wanted to “decouple” changes to state statute from constitutional amendments.
“If we’re to change the constitution, there should be broad support,” he said, “support in each congressional district.” 
State lawmakers, in concert with changes to the initiative petition process, are considering a new congressional map under a request from President Donald Trump.
The amendment also bans ballot measure campaigns from accepting contributions from foreign nationals, aligning the resolution with Gov. Mike Kehoe’s request.
Earlier this year, the legislature passed a law barring foreign spending on state ballot measures.
State Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Democrat from Columbia, asked why Lewis had this piece in the legislation since the spending is already illegal.
Lewis said it would add the restrictions to the Missouri Constitution, whereas they are currently only enacted in state law.
Smith labeled the provision “ballot candy” aimed at tricking voters into supporting changing the initiative petition process. 
“It is extremely sloppy when it talks about foreign adversaries,” he said. “But the reason it was left in here is for ballot candy.”
The proposed summary that would appear on the ballot next year leads with a ban on foreign nationals “providing funding to influence ballot measure elections.”
Through recent ballot measures, Missourians have legalized abortion and recreational use of marijuana and voted to increase the minimum wage and mandate paid-sick leave. In November, the abortion-rights amendment passed with just shy of 52% of the vote with large support from the state’s urban, more-populated areas. Voters in all but eight of Missouri’s 115 counties opposed the amendment.

Initiative petitions in recent years, Lewis said, have been “controversial and partisan,” specifically calling out the marijuana and abortion amendments.
Lewis has been sponsoring legislation to raise the threshold to pass initiative petitions since 2021, when he proposed raising the minimum amount of signatures required to certify petitions.
Earlier this year, Missouri Republicans championed a resolution that would have required a majority of votes in five out of eight congressional districts. Kehoe, in his request for a special legislation session, asked for a majority in all districts.
“Everyone knows it is too strict,” Smith told Lewis during the floor debate. “Even your own party knows it is too strict.”
House Republicans filed amendments, which were not presented Monday, with less rigorous standards than Lewis’.
State Rep. John Simmons, a Republican from Washington, filed an amendment that would have required three-fourths of districts.
State Rep. Rudy Veit, a Republican from Wardsville, proposed raising the minimum for approval from a simple majority to 55% of voters statewide. His proposed amendment did not include requirements for a majority in constitutional districts.
Veit was one of five Republicans who voted against the bill on Monday. The others were state Reps.

(Photo by Perry Beeman/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A handful of Iowa farmers fired up their combines this week to start harvesting corn, according to the latest crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
More than a quarter of corn acres across the state have reached maturity, according to the report, which is ahead of both last year and the five-year average for the reporting period. West central Iowa and the northern regions of the state had lower percentages of mature corn than the rest of the state. 
Eighty percent of corn has dented, which is also ahead of last year, but on par with the five-year average. The report did not give a percentage of the state’s corn crop that has been harvested, but noted harvest of corn silage was a field activity for the period, along with cutting and baling hay.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig noted “initial reports of farmers picking corn” in his statement about the weekly report. 
Iowa soybean progression is ahead of last year’s schedule, but slightly behind the five-year average. Across the state, 44% of soybean acres were coloring and 11% were dropping leaves during the reporting period from Sept. 1-7. 
Soybeans rated 58% good and 18% excellent, slightly below conditions of the previous week. Corn rated 57% good and 23% excellent, also slightly below the crop condition rating from the week prior. 
The third cutting of alfalfa hay is just about wrapped up across the state, with 93% of acres completed. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan reported that while most of the state had dry conditions and rain accumulation of less than an inch, southwestern Iowa had “unseasonably” wet conditions. 
Glisan wrote in the report that 15 weather stations in the southwestern area reported 2 or more inches of rain on Sept. 1. Across the state, the average precipitation was just 0.39 inch, which was below the climatological norm of 0.86 inch. 
Temperatures across the state were also below average, with some regions clocking temperatures 10-12 degrees below normal for the period, which is 67.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The average for the state, which Glisan called “unseasonably” cool, was 59.5 degrees. 
Cover crop cost-share sign up extended
Secretary Naig said last week it was a good time for farmers to think about their fall cover crops. 
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Friday it had extended the deadline for farmers to sign up for the cover crop cost share program through Sept. 18. 
IDALS said in a press release it extended the deadline due to “record demand.” 
“We’ve seen incredibly strong demand for cover crops cost-share this summer and fall, to the point that we’ve already set a new record for investment, and our county offices are reporting that requests continue to roll in,” Naig said in the release. 
Under the program, farmers who are planting cover crops for the first time are eligible for $30 per acre and farmers who have planted in the past are eligible for $20 per acre in cost share funds. The cost share benefits are capped at 160 acres per participant. 
Farmers who are implementing no-till or reduced till practices for the first time are also eligible for additional cost-share assistance through the program. 
The practices are all part of the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which aims to reduce the amount of nitrogen and other nutrients from running off of the fields and into Iowa’s streams. 
Interested farmers can sign up at their local USDA Service Center.

Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) speaks at a press conference in January 2025. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez of Milwaukee is leaving the Assembly Democratic caucus — a decision that comes after leadership alleged that she made comments about shooting three of her colleagues. 
Ortiz-Velez has been at the center of several disagreements over the last several weeks with her colleagues, including a public dispute with the newly-formed Hispanic Legislative Caucus over resolutions to highlight Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Ortiz-Velez said she was excluded from being an author on the resolution, though the leader of the caucus Rep. Priscilla Prado (D-Milwaukee) has said the caucus agreed to limit authors to members. Ortiz-Velez had earlier declined to be a part of the caucus. She decided to write her own resolution honoring Hispanic Heritage Month, and her resolution, which has Republican and Democratic cosponsors, is now being set up to be voted on this week.
Last week her access to the Wisconsin State Capitol was revoked due to an alleged threat, though Assembly Speaker Robin Vos’ office said the revocation was done in error, the threat was found to be not credible and her access restored. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) initially confirmed that Ortiz-Velez had left the caucus but declined to speak on the issue. 
On Friday, however, eight Democratic leaders, including Neubauer, said in a statement to the Journal Sentinel that Ortiz-Velez “made a comment about shooting three members of our caucus who she has had personal disagreements with.”
“This is unacceptable behavior, especially given the heightened political environment and the murder of Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband earlier this year,” the lawmakers said. “We are not in a position to ignore comments like these and referred it to Human Resources. After conversations with the Speaker’s office, we spoke with Capitol Police as well. We appreciated them looking into the matter and handling it from there.”
Former Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were the victims of a politically-motivated assassination in June. 
Ortiz-Velez told the Journal Sentinel that she did not make a threat, but rather used a “poorly worded hyperbole.” 
“What I was trying to express is that I want peace with people, but others seem to keep attacking me, and if they attack me, I have a right to defend myself. And if someone perceived it differently, I’m very sorry, and I will be certain to refrain from that kind of language in the future,” Ortiz-Velez said. 
Ortiz-Velez has previously split from her caucus on other votes. She was the only Democrat to vote for the new legislative maps that were drawn by Gov. Tony Evers and that Republican lawmakers decided to adopt, she was one of a handful of Democrats to vote for the recent state budget in July and also recently was the only Democrat on a bill, vetoed by Evers, that would have declared gig workers to be independent contractors.
According to WisPolitics, Ortiz-Velez also alleges that her colleagues were trying to keep her from testifying on AB 306, a Republican bill that would restrict an executive emergency powers, because she plans to accuse Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who plans to run for governor, of abusing his power during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I left the caucus because they’ve been terrible to me,” Ortiz-Velez told WisPolitics.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Trump administration is arguing to a federal judge that a recent increase in the flow of migrants into the United States requires courts to reconsider prior rulings that have upheld a New Jersey directive providing sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.
Four New Jersey cities that have been sued by the administration over their local sanctuary policies have argued that the constitutionality of sanctuary orders was upheld in 2021 by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in a case brought by Ocean County. But the Trump administration said the judge overseeing the new dispute should instead consider two other immigration-related decisions that found in the federal government’s favor.
“The current crisis of illegal immigration, which was allowed to reach critical levels after Ocean County was decided, requires a re-examination of that ruling,” the administration says in a letter filed with the court last week.
The Trump administration has challenged policies in Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson that limit local officials’ ability to share information with federal immigration authorities, arguing those policies are preempted by federal law. Attorneys for the cities have argued that the administration has no standing to sue because the cities would have to follow the state’s sanctuary policy, called the Immigrant Trust Directive, if they had no local sanctuary policies.
But the administration alleges that those local policies “impose even greater restrictions” than the state’s directive.
“The Newark policy, for example, precludes ‘any contract, agreement, or arrangement to detain immigrants in deportation proceedings, including but not limited to Intergovernmental Service Agreements,’” the administration’s letter reads.
The four cities have asked U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin to review this case speedily for public safety purposes.
Gurbir Grewal, an attorney who represents Hoboken and Newark in this dispute, is a former New Jersey attorney general who crafted the Immigrant Trust Act, which restricts when state and local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
A federal judge in 2021 ruled the directive was not preempted by federal law because it sought to regulate the behavior of state and local officials, not federal ones, and requires local officials not to aid federal immigration efforts, rather than attempt to frustrate those efforts. 
“The United States already brought such a challenge and lost,” Grewal wrote in a filing in the case last month.
The 3rd Circuit decision from 2021 also found that the state directive is not preempted by federal law.
Federal attorneys argued in the newest letter that the cities’ policies discriminate against the federal government because Paterson’s policy does not apply to local law enforcement officials placed on federal task forces and therefore treats U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection differently than other agencies.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 17:57:57.690604

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A state law banning certain lessons on race from K-12 public schools can remain in place, a federal judge said in a Monday order dismissing a lawsuit.
In January, several students and educators, along with an author and the state NAACP, sued to challenge a state law included in the state budget since 2021 that bans teachers from using eight concepts in classrooms. Among the banned concepts are the ideas that any race is inherently superior or automatically racist, that anyone is responsible for past atrocities because of their race, that someone’s worth is determined by race and that traits such as hard work are oppressive and racist.

163115053039 
That law didn’t cause concrete harm to the educators challenging it, and suspending it wouldn’t solve the issues the students and author in the lawsuit claimed it caused them, because other factors played a role, U.S. District Judge Sherri Lydon wrote in the Monday order. That wasn’t necessarily because she disagreed with their claims but because they didn’t meet the standards to bring a lawsuit in the first place, she wrote.
“The court recognizes that the issues raised are matters of public importance,” Lydon wrote. But because the people suing lacked the legal standing to challenge it, “the Constitution leaves their resolution to the democratic process rather than the federal courts.”
Each group involved in the case claimed the law caused a separate effect that harmed them. The students claimed the law caused the Department of Education to remove a class on Black history, while author Ibram Kendi argued it meant the removal of one of his books from school classrooms and libraries. A librarian and a teacher claimed the law forced them to change their lesson plans or risk being fired.
Altogether, those suing claimed the law went against their First Amendment rights to information, as well as the Constitution’s 14th Amendment’s guarantee of due process and equal protection.
During a July hearing, much of the argument in the case centered around the removal of an Advanced Placement African American Studies course following a two-year pilot program. The four students who joined the lawsuit, two of whom were members of the NAACP, either wanted to take the course but couldn’t or had signed up but had it removed from their class schedule, according to legal filings.
Deputy Superintendent Matthew Ferguson pointed to the law and “significant controversy around the course” as reasons for removing it from the roster for the 2024-2025 school year, though he also pointed to an upcoming scheduled review of the state’s social studies standards in a memo sent to superintendents statewide.
Because the department had multiple reasons to remove the course, and because Ferguson later said the primary reason was the scheduled review, suspending the law wouldn’t mean districts would have to reinstate the class, Lydon wrote in her order.
School districts have the option of offering an honors level course of African American history, and students can still take the end-of-course AP exam to potentially earn college credit. At schools with that option, students would have to pay the $98 to earn college credit, which the Department of Education covers only for classes on its roster, and AP classes give students more of a GPA bump than honors courses.
Judge to decide if SC law banning 8 concepts on race from classrooms violates Constitution

Suspending the law also wouldn’t mean Lexington County School District Three would have to reinstate Kendi’s book “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You” in classroom lessons, Lydon wrote.
Kendi joined the lawsuit after a state-level review found that his book didn’t meet the criteria for factual accuracy and objectivity required to teach a nonfiction book. One anonymous reviewer also mentioned the budget clause as a reason to remove the book, though it wasn’t clear whether that played a role in the final decision, Lydon wrote.
Because reviewers had multiple reasons to remove Kendi’s book, most of which were based on a different state law about classroom materials, Kendi also lacked the ability to sue, Lydon decided.
A school librarian who stopped offering a reading club featuring diverse books and an English teacher who halted a lesson plan about systemic racism failed to prove the law actually harmed them, Lydon wrote. Instead, both said they feared for their jobs under the law, without proving their school districts actually intended to discipline them in any way, failing another prong of the test for legal standing, the judge decided.
Attorney General Alan Wilson called the order a win for his office.
“This case was never about real harm to students; it was about activists trying to push their political agenda through the courts,” Wilson said in a statement. “The ruling reaffirms that’s not how our system works.”
An attorney representing the students, educators and NAACP did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear whether those involved will appeal the decision.
Both Republican and Democratic legislators agreed the budget clause could cause confusion and end up stifling instruction. In 2023, the Senate passed a bill specifically protecting “historically accurate” discussions of slavery, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, segregation, racial lynchings and any “historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, sex, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region.”
Opponents, many of whom didn’t realize the law would clean up the clause already in the state budget, fought against the bill over claims that it would cause teachers to censor their own lessons. The bill died in the House at the end of the 2024 legislative session.



What does the law say?
Since 2021, the state budget has included this clause:
For the current fiscal year, of the funds allocated by the Department of Education to school districts, no monies shall be used by any school district or school to provide instruction in, to teach, instruct, or train any administrator, teacher, staff member, or employee to adopt or believe, or to approve for use, make use of, or carry out standards, curricula, lesson plans, textbooks, instructional materials, or instructional practices that serve to inculcate any of the following concepts:
(1) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex;
(2) an individual, by virtue of his race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously;
(3) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his race or sex;
(4) an individual’s moral standing or worth is necessarily determined by his race or sex;
(5) an individual, by virtue of his race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;
(6) an individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex;
(7) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by members of a particular race to oppress members of another race; and
(8) fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting any professional development training for teachers related to issues of addressing unconscious bias within the context of teaching certain literary or historical concepts or issues related to the impacts of historical or past discriminatory policies.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_8172-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 17:57:57.690604

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Enrollment across the University of Nebraska system remained steady year over year, with the NU system on Monday reporting a 0.2% enrollment decline, or a difference of 111 students.
Much of the decrease in total fall enrollment to 49,648 comes from international students (174 fewer students) and graduate students (238 fewer students). NU saw an enrollment bump from first-time freshmen and health profession students. Professional students pay more in tuition than undergraduates.
As a whole, student credit hours are up across NU campuses by 0.3%, up to 606,316 credit hours, which NU officials said indicates “enhanced” student retention. The Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture in Curtis saw an increase in students driven by a new online veterinary technician program.
Enrollment figures are based on the sixth day of classes.
“These enrollment numbers show that we are subject to the national trends but continue to serve Nebraskans well,” NU President Jeffrey Gold said in a statement.


Campus fall 2025 enrollment
University of Nebraska system: 49,648, down 0.2%
University of Nebraska-Lincoln: 23,952, down 0.2%
University of Nebraska at Omaha: 14,954, down 0.1%
University of Nebraska at Kearney: 5,699, down 3.1%
University of Nebraska Medical Center: 4,818, up 2.4%
Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture: 213, up 6%


Besides NCTA, the University of Nebraska Medical Center saw a 2.4% increase in enrollment, while NU campuses in Lincoln, Omaha and Kearney saw slight decreases.
Dr. Gold, a former UNMC chancellor for 10 years, noted the continued growth in Med Center enrollment reflects a “steady, more than 25-year trajectory.”
“That growth is vital to meeting the health care needs of communities across Nebraska, today and well into the future,” Gold said Monday.
NU is facing a systemwide budget shortfall of $20 million by the end of this year. However, some campuses, primarily the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, are finalizing plans to cut a total of more than $40 million in the coming months.

UNL’s plan is expected to be unveiled this week. Those shortfalls include the roughly 5% tuition increase approved in June.
At his inaugural “State of the University” address on Thursday, Gold said the university system would meet current and future learners “where they are at” with changing demographics. For example, more students are taking college credits first in high school dual credit courses or at community colleges, and many are preferring courses partially or entirely online, Gold said. One-third of NU students also rely on Pell Grants, and nearly three in four NU students are Pell-eligible.
“They [statistics] point us to a new future for higher education that serves a new type of learner, creating new and different opportunities for the university system and for our odyssey together ahead,” Gold said Thursday.
Gold said the response includes credit-sharing agreements with community colleges, more online programs and a focus on individualized student support and success.
“Like institutions nationwide, we continue to face headwinds with graduate and international enrollment, and there is important work ahead to ensure that we continue to grow enrollment, support workforce demands across a wide range of Nebraska industries and fuel the future of our state,” Gold said Monday.

The construction industry is — and will remain — one of the most knowledge-driven, human-powered sectors of the workforce.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Joshua Reap: Trade education solves more than just a labor shortage.","This commentary is by Joshua Reap, of Candia, New Hampshire. Reap is the board president of the Vermont Construction Academy, where he helps lead efforts to expand hands-on construction education and credential-based workforce training across the state. He also serves as the president and CEO of the Associated Builders and Contractors of New Hampshire/Vermont (ABC NH/VT), advocating for workforce development, opportunity in the trades and policies that support a strong, skilled construction industry.


We’re facing a workforce crisis: thousands of open jobs in the trades, and not enough people trained to fill them.
On one side, we have thousands of job openings across the skilled trades — positions in carpentry, electrical, HVAC and more — offering strong wages, long-term security and a clear path for advancement. On the other side, we have young adults uncertain about their future, displaced workers needing to retool and an aging generation of tradespeople preparing to retire.
The Vermont Construction Academy was built to bridge that gap.
With multiple pathways into the workforce — whether it’s our boot camps, registered apprenticeships or custom, off-site technical trainings — the academy is helping to redefine what career success looks like. 
We’re doing it at a critical time, when traditional education systems, especially public career and technical education centers are simply unable to serve the number of people who want to build a better future with their hands and minds.
We believe the trades deserve a seat at the table — not just because we need buildings built or roads paved, but because we also need problem solvers, creative thinkers and lifelong learners who understand how to lead, collaborate and show up with purpose. The academy doesn’t just teach technical skills. We develop the social skills, teamwork and integrity needed to thrive in today’s economy.
The truth is, our economy is changing faster than anyone can keep up.
As artificial intelligence begins to disrupt a variety of industries — from legal and financial services to media and customer support — the trades are emerging as a future-proof career path. You cannot replace a plumber with an algorithm. You cannot patch drywall with a chatbot. The construction industry is — and will remain — one of the most knowledge-driven, human-powered sectors of the workforce. In Vermont, we’re doubling down on that.
The latest workforce report from Associated Builders and Contractors National ranked New Hampshire among the top four states in the country for lowest construction unemployment in June. Much like our neighbors to the east, this report shows Vermont not far behind — and with the work we’re doing through the Vermont Construction Academy, we’re on track to close that gap even further.
We’re not just talking about it. We’re building real momentum.
Under the leadership of Ross Lavoie, the academy has expanded real-world, hands-on training opportunities. Ross regularly brings in industry experts to work directly with students, giving them the chance to learn by doing — welding, roofing, framing and more — all under the guidance of professionals actively working in the field. 
These immersive experiences are what set the academy apart. Our boot camps are upskilling students, veterans and career changers alike. We’re building partnerships with contractors who are eager to hire. We’re reaching individuals who have long been underserved or overlooked by traditional systems because that’s what the workforce actually needs.
We don’t do it alone.
Everything we do at the Vermont Construction Academy is grounded in our core values:

Professional: We uphold the highest of standards in everything we do — from our teaching to our safety protocols.
Initiative: We teach our students to take ownership of their success.
Teamwork: We believe in building trust, shared responsibility, and strong site culture.
Integrity: We hold ourselves accountable to quality, safety and doing the right thing, even when no one’s watching.
Innovation: We embrace progress — new tools, new training models and new ways to meet workforce demand.
Work ethic: We demonstrate determination, grit and ambition every single day.

We’re not waiting for someone else to solve the labor shortage. We’re solving it here in Vermont, one student at a time.
Beyond solving a workforce challenge, we’re also changing hearts and minds about what it means to “make it” in this world. Not every student needs a four-year degree to find purpose. Not every graduate needs to move to a city to find opportunity. Not every family needs to carry the burden of debt to feel pride in their future.
At Vermont Construction Academy, we offer something different. Something real. Something lasting.
It’s time to rethink what success looks like — and start investing in the workforce we actually need.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)If the temporary leader of the University of Florida does not become its formal leader, the school owes him $2 million. 
That’s what the UF Board of Trustees proposed in a contract yet to be approved by the Florida Board of Governors. 
Donald Landry, a Columbia University medical researcher and professor, was revealed as the university’s interim leader last month. His first day was Sept. 1, although his employment awaits final approval from the Board of Governors this week. 
Columbia University professor named University of Florida interim leader

Landry’s contract would expire on Aug. 31, 2026. 
If the Board of Governors approves the contract, UF will owe Landry $2 million in “severance” pay if he is not eventually named formal president. Landry’s base salary for the coming year is $2 million with a $500,000 performance incentive. 
The position is open after former UF President Ben Sasse resigned and after the governors rejected former University of Michigan President Santa Ono as his successor. In the meantime, former UF President Kent Fuchs has been serving as interim president.
Despite his rejection, the UF Board of Trustees and its chair, Mori Hosseini, stood by Ono’s qualifications and candidacy.
Ono had been offered a $3 million contract.
If the governors reject UF trustees’ pick this time, there is a price tag attached to it.
For comparison, Florida International University President Jeanette Nuñez did not have that provision in her interim president contract. Nuñez was widely viewed as the likely the formal president, so much so that one trustee questioned the need for a search. 
University of West Florida interim President Manny Diaz Jr. will be entitled to 20 weeks of severance pay if he does not complete his contract. He has expressed interest in the permanent job.
Landry’s contract also lists “key duties” of appointing a provost and interim deans and to “commit to working with Florida and Federal DOGE to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse.”

A federal prosecutor told a judge Monday in the case against Theodore Bland that they are waiting on a decision from Pamela Bondi on whether to pursue his execution.

Federal prosecutors in Vermont are awaiting word from U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi on whether they will seek the death penalty in the case against a former Stowe man charged in the 2023 fatal shooting of two Massachusetts men. 
Theodore Bland, 30, had been indicted by a grand jury earlier this year in Vermont with federal crimes that could carry the possibility of the death penalty, if he were to be convicted. 
During a hearing Monday, federal Judge William K. Sessions III asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Turner, one of the prosecutors in the case, about how the parties were moving the case forward. 
“I’d like to know what the status is,” Sessions said to Turner.

“At this point,” Turner replied, “we are awaiting a decision of the attorney general with regard to whether the government intends to seek capital punishment in this case.” 
Turner said attorneys for the prosecution and defense both met with a committee at the U.S. Department of Justice to make their cases about their positions on whether the death penalty should be pursued in the case.
Sessions then asked if Turner had an “expected timeline” for Bondi’s decision. 
“I do not, your honor,” Turner responded. 
According to federal prosecutors, an indictment against Bland charged him with using and carrying “a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime causing the deaths of Jahim Solomon and Eric White in circumstances that constitute murder under federal law.”
On Oct. 25, 2023, Vermont State Police said authorities found the bodies of Solomon, 21, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and White, 21, of Chicopee, Massachusetts, in a wooded area of Eden, about a mile apart from each other. 
Both men, according to state police, had been fatally shot.
About 10 days before their bodies were found, state police said that their families had reported them missing. The families also reported that the men had been not in contact for several days and were last known to be in Vermont.
Court records filed in Bland’s federal case stated that the killings took place on Oct. 12, 2023, when “Bland’s firearm discharges caused the deaths of Jahim Solomon and Eric White.”

Dilan Jiron, 21 and a co-defendant in the case, entered into a plea deal with prosecutors in July. He pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to possess a firearm in a drug trafficking crime and helping Bland cover up the fatal shootings. 
Jiron, formerly of Hyde Park, faces up to 23 years in prison on the two charges. He is set to be sentenced in October. 
Vermont last carried out an execution in 1954. The state no longer has a death penalty statute on the books. However, Bland’s case was brought under federal law, which does permit the death penalty as a punishment for certain crimes. 
Former President Joseph Biden had imposed a moratorium on the federal death penalty, but President Donald Trump lifted that moratorium through an executive order after taking office in January.
Bondi has already approved pursuing the death penalty in another Vermont case brought in federal court against Teresa Youngblut, 21. Prosecutors have accused Youngblut of fatally shooting David Maland, a border patrol agent, in January during a traffic stop on Interstate 91 in Coventry. 
Youngblut, formerly of Washington state, pleaded not guilty Friday in federal court in Burlington to a new indictment brought in the case that included capital crimes, including one for murder in Maland’s death. Youngblut has been linked to a group known as the Zizians, whose members have been connected to several other homicides across the country.
Attorneys in Bland’s case said during Monday’s hearing that the prosecution has worked to provide the defense lawyers with evidence related to the case. 
“So then all parties are awaiting a decision from the attorney general from the Department of Justice,” Sessions, the judge, said as the hearing came to a close. “Once that decision is made perhaps we can have another status conference and see where we go from there.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The First Judicial District Court in north-central New Mexico on Monday announced a new diversion program for people who are charged with some crimes, have a severe mental illness and may be unable to understand legal proceedings or participate in their own defense.
New Mexico public defenders and criminal justice advocates have pointed to competency diversion as one way to address the over-reliance on the criminal legal system for behavioral health crises, which they say criminalizes mental illness and contributes to incarceration rates and recidivism.
“We can make our communities safer by addressing the behavioral health issues of people who otherwise may repeatedly cycle in and out of the justice system,” First Judicial District Court Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid said in a statement.
People charged with a misdemeanor — with the exception of DWI — or a nonviolent felony are eligible for diversion, the Administrative Office of the Courts said in a news release.
If the person agrees to the program and receives approval from their defense attorney, the prosecutor and the judge in their case, trained navigators will connect them to mental health treatment and other community services to meet their needs, the AOC said.
“The program diverts qualifying people away from the justice system and connects them to treatment and support services needed for possible recovery,” Justice Briana Zamora, the Supreme Court’s liaison to the Commission on Mental Health and Competency, said in a statement.
If a defendant successfully completes a navigation plan in collaboration with court staff, the courts will dismiss the charges against them, the AOC said. Those who fail to remain engaged with available services will still face criminal proceedings, the agency said.
People facing misdemeanor charges will be referred to the program for three to six months, while those facing nonviolent felony charges will be referred for six months to a year.

The Santa Fe County Magistrate Court in Santa Fe will host a community event about the new competency diversion program on Sept. 12.

The First Judicial District includes Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos counties. Its new program is the fourth competency diversion pilot program established by New Mexico courts since last year, the AOC said, joining ones in the Third Judicial District in Doña Ana County; the Fourth Judicial District in San Miguel, Guadalupe and Mora counties; and the Twelfth Judicial District in Lincoln and Otero counties.
New Mexico in 2024 allocated $3 million for competency diversion pilot programs, along with court-ordered mental health treatment for adults with mental illness who are found to be dangerous called assisted outpatient treatment.

“Our courts serve as community problem solvers by operating competency diversion programs,” Chief Justice David Thomson said in a statement. “These programs demonstrate the Judiciary’s commitment to advancing efforts by the Legislature and governor to improve how New Mexico responds to people struggling with mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system.”

Across the country, local journalism is disappearing. Since I began reporting for Vermont newspapers in the early 2000s, the number of journalists in the United States has fallen by more than 75%. Today, one in three counties has no full-time local reporter.
But Vermont is an exception because of you.
A new report from Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News reveals that Vermont maintains the highest number of local journalists per capita in the nation, thanks in large part to VTDigger and the readers who support us. While we still have a long way to go to restore our press corps, this is an achievement worth celebrating.
I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together. But keeping Vermonters informed takes ongoing commitment. When we say we can’t do it without you, we truly mean it: The only way to keep VTDigger strong is with continued support from readers like you.
If you value independent, in-depth reporting that explains complex issues, connects neighbors and holds power to account, I invite you to become a sustaining member today.

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)A Raleigh County judge overseeing two legal challenges in a battle over West Virginia’s school vaccination laws and religious freedom will move forward this week with a permanent injunction hearing, despite a request from opposite sides that he pause proceedings.
The state Supreme Court plans to take up the state Board of Education’s appeal of Raleigh Circuit Judge Michael Froble’s preliminary injunction in the lawsuit that Miranda Guzman and the families of two other students brought against the school board.
Froble ruled in July in favor of Guzman and the other families. They sued over the school board’s decision not to allow religious exemptions to the state’s mandatory school vaccination requirements. The judge’s preliminary ruling allows only the three students in the case to attend school with a religious exemption to the requirements.
The high court said it would take up the school board’s appeal no sooner than early next year.
The Raleigh County lawsuit has also been consolidated with a lawsuit filed in Kanawha County by Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson, two parents of immunocompromised children, against the state Department of Health. That lawsuit seeks to stop the health department from issuing religious exemptions. Plaintiffs in the case are represented by the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice.
Froble on Monday denied a joint motion filed Friday by attorneys representing both the school board and the families asking to hold off on further proceedings in the case in anticipation of the Supreme Court taking on the matter.
“Given that all parties in the Guzman matter, including Plaintiffs, see no avenue for statewide relief in this Guzman matter and given that there is a preliminary injunction in place allowing Plaintiffs’ children to attend school, all parties respectfully join in a request to stay this Guzman matter pending a decision from the Supreme Court on Defendants’ appeal,” the attorneys wrote.
Froble denied the request during a hearing with parties in the case on Monday morning.
All states require school children to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases including polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow children to opt out because of religious or philosophical objections to the shots. Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. Morrisey has not rescinded the executive order despite the state Legislature this year rejecting a bill that would have established the exemptions in state code. Morrisey’s executive order is based on the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.
The West Virginia school board voted not to comply with Morrisey’s executive order and to instruct county boards of education to require all vaccines and allow only medical exemptions to those vaccination requirements.
State attorney general J.B. McCuskey filed an amicus brief in the case on Morrisey’s behalf. In it, Morrisey asked the judge to avoid considering the school vaccination law’s constitutionality. He also said the judge cannot issue a statewide injunction against the school board in the case, asked that he let his executive order stand and said that the judge should not create his own process for exemptions and responding to outbreaks.
“Here, it is not necessary to decide the vaccination law’s constitutionality,” McCuskey wrote in the brief. “Neither the Guzman Plaintiffs nor the Hess Plaintiffs have raised a constitutional challenge to the law. The Guzman Plaintiffs say the Board of Education’s no religious exemption policy, which is based on a flawed reading of the vaccination law, violates the EPRA [Equal Protection for Religion Act]. The Hess Plaintiffs say the Department of Health’s implementation of the executive order is illegal. The constitutionality of the vaccination law is, simply, not before the Court.”
The hearing is set for Wednesday and Thursday at 9 a.m. each day at the Raleigh County Judicial Center in Beckley.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Judge-Froble-20250724-1024x691.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 17:57:57.690604

“For a state that wants to encourage small business, this probably shouldn't be happening,” said one small-business owner who hadn’t been paid by the state since VTBuys rolled out in early July.

Ryan Golding, owner of Mastaler Cleaning Service, has contracts with the state to provide janitorial services at multiple properties. But for the last two months, since the state rolled out its new digital procurement system VTBuys, he says the state hasn’t paid about $12,000 it owes.
“That whole time, I’ve covered all my labor costs, all the equipment, all my supplies,” he said in an interview last week. “I can borrow from Peter and pay Paul basically until I get paid by the state.”
Golding is one of three small-business owners who told VTDigger they haven’t been paid or received payments late since Vermont adopted its new digital one-stop shop for state contracts, bidding and vendor payment. Two others spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear they’d lose future work with the state for speaking to the media.

The Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services and the Agency of Digital Services intended to launch VTBuys July 1, but coding bugs delayed the system’s rollout. At the time, Wanda Minoli, Buildings and General Services commissioner, said the false start was a natural part of pivoting to such a sweeping new system, and she remained confident in VTBuys’ effectiveness as an upgraded e-procurement platform. 
After that initial delay, state leaders assured lawmakers late last month that VTBuys is now functioning well, paying state contractors and registering vendors. The initial hiccups, they said, had been quickly fixed. 
But the complaints from small businesses appear to contradict that assessment. Asked why some vendors had not been paid, Cole Barney, spokesperson for the Department of Buildings and General Services, told VTDigger in an email that some agencies across state government have a backlog of payments since the switch to VTBuys. He wrote that while delays are expected with any transition, the state takes seriously “our responsibility for paying our vendors timely.” 
“It is not a universal issue and there are a few factors contributing, including workflow approval errors and some user errors,” Barney wrote. 
Small businesses working with the state told VTDigger their experience with VTBuys has been far from the historical norm. While one acknowledged an occasional payment delay in the past, all described their invoice issues as new, not something they expected under the previous system. 
One owner of a small business said they’re owed about $10,000 from the state, a portion of the $100,000-$200,000 worth of work they tend to do for the state annually. 
“Every inquiry I make into how soon can we get paid,” the business owner said, “is basically (met with), ‘The system is too complicated, we don’t have enough help.’”
In the past, invoices would be processed in a day or two, the contractor told VTDigger. Now, with two-month-old invoices, they said they are disappointed with the lack of communication and urgency. 
“For a state that wants to encourage small business, this probably shouldn’t be happening,” the small-business owner said. “Because a small business can’t survive if they’re not being paid.”
A third small-business leader told VTDigger in late August the state owed them more than $60,000, almost $30,000 of which was two months past due. 
“These are significant sums for our company,” they wrote in an email.
The state has since paid the invoices — a huge relief, according to the source. But the company is a subcontractor on another state project that still has unpaid invoices from July, they said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — Public education advocates are asking Kentucky’s General Assembly to invest $718 million more in the state’s schools. 
The request comes from Protect Our Schools, a coalition of educators, administrators, students and parents who want more money in K-12 education in the state’s next two-year budget, which is up for debate in January. However, Republican lawmakers are skeptical of the proposal. 
Protect Our Schools pointed out that the $718 million figure is the same as a half-percent income tax cut approved earlier this year by the General Assembly.
During a Louisville press conference, Rockcastle County Superintendent Carrie Ballinger said the proposed investment would be about 3% of the state’s overall budget and would reflect a spending increase of $1,161 per Kentucky student. As a school administrator, she says she sees gaps between what students deserve and what schools can provide them.
“This is not about spending more, however,” Ballinger said. “This is about investing wisely. Every dollar we invest in education today is a dollar that we are investing in our workforce of tomorrow. This reduces reliance on government assistance, strengthens our families and fuels the Kentucky economy.” 
Ballinger added that while Kentucky’s last two-year budget “was the highest that we have seen in terms of raw dollars,” it falls short of 2008 levels of investment because of inflation. 
The $718 million investment could raise SEEK funding, or Support Education Excellence in Kentucky, by 14% and aid in fully funding transportation costs as well as support resources like textbooks, professional development and technology in classrooms across the state. The SEEK formula determines the amount of state funding to local school districts.

Earlier this year, Protect Our Schools launched a statewide listening tour to gather information about education in Kentucky ahead of the 2026 legislative session. When lawmakers return to Frankfort in January, they will decide the next two-year state budget. 
Asked for comment about Protect Our Schools’ request, Republican House Speaker David Osborne said in a statement that the General Assembly has “provided a record amount of funding and resources to public education and K-12 school funding accounts for the largest general fund category.” 
“Despite this, far too many Kentucky children don’t read or understand math at grade level,” he said. “It is past time for the education bureaucracy to stop demanding more money and instead focus on the classroom and helping students reach their potential.”
In Kentucky, education funding is a testy topic between public school advocates and Republican lawmakers. While some groups like the Kentucky Education Association have argued paying teachers more would incentivize more people to go into the profession, Republicans have argued the General Assembly, controlled by the GOP, has provided a historic level of K-12 education funding.
The Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank based in Berea, says K-12 funding has not kept pace with inflation. Real total budgeted state SEEK funding is 24% below 2008 levels for this fiscal year, the policy center said in a report released last month.
After the defeat of Amendment 2 last year, Protect Our Schools transitioned to a wider education advocacy role. The group was one of the highest fundraising political action committees against the proposed constitutional amendment, which would have allowed the General Assembly to fund nonpublic schools and was backed by many members of the General Assembly.

Paris Republican Sen. Steve West, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, told the Kentucky Lantern in an interview Monday afternoon that he did not foresee lawmakers wanting to increase taxes. Also, West noted, the state’s revenue and budget numbers for the last fiscal year did not meet the thresholds the legislature set in 2022 to consider another income tax rate cut next year. 
West also added that Republicans have increased K-12 education funding by a billion dollars over the past two budgets. 
Also over the summer, the use of existing education funding has been scrutinized. Republican Auditor Allison Ball’s office released an examination of the Kentucky Department of Education that found the department failed to use $250 million in SEEK funding during fiscal years 2021-24, though KDE disputed the finding in the report. In particular, Fayette County Public Schools, the state’s second largest district, has faced turmoil over its budget proposals and spending. West said news reports such as these factor into lawmakers’ decisions about budgets. 
As a member of the legislature for more than a decade, West said he would anticipate Republicans to continue to focus on conservative budgets. 
“We will continue to pass very conservative budgets that protect the budget reserve trust fund that fund our obligations, as pertains to the pension system and other things, that protect our bonding capacity and our credit rating,” West said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5136-e1757366678229-1024x716.jpg,,,2025-09-08 17:57:57.690604

(Provided by the Montana Legislature)If his natty dress or the prodigious mustache didn’t impress you, former Montana lawmaker Duane Ankney’s understated sense of humor would.
The longtime lawmaker, a former coal miner himself, died this weekend at 79. He was an unabashed champion of coal and his home district of Colstrip. He was known for the closing rejoinder of “don’t let the bastards get you down” and known throughout the Capitol as a lawmaker who could get things done.
A solidly Republican politician, he wasn’t afraid to buck his own party, especially on a some social issues, including standing up for some LGBTQ+ causes. He was known for his snappy dress in Helena, but around his district, he was more likely to be in a work shirt and baseball cap.
He was a huge voice and advocate for the aging Colstrip power plant and mining for coal, understanding the economic engine of the southern Montana region.  He carried a number of different bills aimed at keeping the aging power plant, often referred to as one of the “dirtiest in the nation,” in operation. He was adamant about the need to use carbon-based energy, and sometimes referred to climate change as a hoax.
But in recent years, Ankney had also become more open to the idea of repurposing the Colstrip plant, converting it from coal to some other form of generation, including nuclear power.
As a former coal miner and superintendent, he never lost sight of the working Montanan, and even helped Democrats during the Bullock administration pass legislation aimed at dark money in politics. He had been the target of some dark money campaigns, and didn’t mind a political fight, just as long as it was an honest one.
He served a total of 16 years in the Montana Capitol in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Condolences poured in online for Ankney, who had been a Montana resident since he was discharged from the United States Navy in 1969.
Ellie Boldman, a state senator and Democrat from Missoula, recounted a story when he stood against his own party in favor of his own family.
In April 2013, most county attorneys broke with the Republicans and asked the state to change the state statute because being gay was still a felony, according to state law.
The law seemed facially unconstitutional so attorneys wanted help from the lawmakers. While the state’s Senate had passed the bill, it had been killed in the House by the Judiciary Committee, said Boldman.
Using a procedural motion, often referred to as “blasting,” lawmakers moved the stalled bill from the committee to floor. The vote was narrow, with others nervously awaiting the bill’s fate. One man, Ankney, rose to speak about it.
“He told the story of his two sons and one daughter, all who served in the military, and one who happened to be gay. And, by God, she was no felon. Google the speech. You won’t forget it,” Boldman said on Facebook. “Duane was what worked in the Montana Capitol. Common sense. Working together. Finding a middle ground. Sense of humor. And, nobody fought harder for the workers in Colstrip.”
That was a sentiment shared by Montana Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell.
“Duane Ankney was one-of-a-kind. You always knew where he stood, and where he stood was always with the Colstrip community and the rest of his constituents,” Regier said. “His unwavering dedication to fighting for them was apparent in every conversation anyone had with him at the legislature. His memory and legacy will live on with us, and he is already missed.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ankney.jpg,,,2025-09-08 17:57:57.690604

It’s lower than the Treasurer’s $315 million estimate in January for what the program would need for the 2026-27 school year when the program opens up to all students to participate. 
Since January, the estimate of newly eligible students in West Virginia has dropped by 11,000. 
The Treasurer’s Office said the population revision was based on updated traditional homeschool data provided by the West Virginia Department of Education and the current Hope Scholarship participant data. 
“The largest contributor is the population of newly eligible students for the 2026-2027 school year dropped from around 54,000 to roughly 43,000,” State Treasurer Larry Pack said in a news release Monday. “The good news is that this will save the state around $70 million. Regardless of the expected cost, we look forward to helping our parents and students find the right education that fits their unique needs.”
WVDE Communications Director Christy Day said the data provided to the State Treasurer’s office was based on the numbers of home school and non-public students for the past few years. “WVDE was not a part of any calculations or estimates for HOPE,” she wrote in an email.
Jake Flatley, assistant communications director for the Treasurer’s Office, told West Virginia Watch that the estimated student number decrease was due to larger graduating senior classes being replaced by smaller incoming kindergarten homeschool classes as more kids choose the Hope Scholarship.
“This presumes we are capturing more of this specific student population with the Hope Scholarship. We have seen across the country that a large portion of homeschool parents will never opt to participate in ESA programs,” Flatley said. 
Birth rates are also declining, he added. 
Lawmakers, tasked with passing a state budget, have frontloaded the voucher program with money ahead of the school year so it could potentially accommodate 100% of eligible students using the Hope Scholarship. 
The Legislature funded around $100 million for the current school year, and it was the largest funding increase requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in his first budget proposal. Around 19,000 students are using the program this school year, typically at private religious schools. 
The program needs $244,580,215 for the 2025-26 school year. The projections will be further refined in December if needed to provide the most accurate Hope Scholarship funding estimate possible heading into the 2026 Legislative session, the Treasurer’s office said.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/West-Virginia-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-08 20:52:27+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont exploring how to maintain COVID vaccine access in CT,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/08/lamont-covid-vaccine-access-ct/,Gov. Ned Lamont said he has consulted with New York and Massachusetts about how to continue easy access to COVID vaccines.,"Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday he is exploring how he could require insurers to continue the nearly universal coverage of inoculating against COVID, contradicting the Trump administration.
“People ought to have the choice. They ought to be able to get the COVID vaccine at their local pharmacy. That’s what I’m looking at right now,” Lamont said.
His staff was weighing the legal options available to governor and had consulted with CVS, a major provider of COVID inoculations, over what state guidance would be sufficient to assure the continued availability.
Using different legal instruments, the governors of Massachusetts and New York took steps last week to require pharmacies to continue providing free access to COVID vaccinations, as was standard until recently.
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued an executive order Thursday requiring insurers to continue covering the cost of the vaccinations, but the Bay State has a pharmacy regulatory structure that appears to give Healey authority unavailable to Lamont.
The Massachusetts Association of Health Plans supported Healey’s order. 
In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, then issued a similar executive order to Healey’s under her emergency powers. Lamont was exploring whether he might have to make a similar declaration. 
On Aug. 27, the Food and Drug Administration recommended limiting vaccinations to people age 65 and older or to those who have certain risk factors, upending what has been the status quo for several years.
The FDA change meant that people younger than 65 might need a prescription and face out-of-pocket costs for a booster.
Lamont called it misguided and premature.
“The COVID vaccine helped us get through COVID during the worst days, better than just about any other state. It’s not behind us yet,” Lamont said of the virus. 
The state Insurance Department deferred questions to the governor’s office.
Susan Halpin, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, said the group would support a measure from Lamont similar to that issued by other states.
“CTAHP would be pleased to work with State of CT to support evidence-based public health wellness through an expansion of vaccination policy,” she wrote.
The action by the FDA, which is part of the Health and Human Services Department overseen by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, generated confusion about vaccine access, as well as prompting hostile questions to Kennedy during a Senate hearing last week.
An advisory panel on vaccines at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to meet on Sept. 18 and 19. It has yet to issue its guidance, but Kennedy has overhauled the committee with new members who have expressed anti-vaccine views.
At the Senate hearing last week, Kennedy insisted the vaccines remain widely available, clashing with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who insisted that was not the case.
“If you don’t recommend, then the consequence of that in many states is that you can’t walk into a pharmacy and get one,” Warren said. “It means insurance companies don’t have to cover the $200 or so cost.”
“It depends on the states,” Kennedy said. “But they can still get it. Everybody can get it. Everybody can get it, senator.”
Lamont took questions from reporters about vaccine coverage at an event in Canton celebrating the state’s release of $2.5 million in funding for a workforce training center for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. He denounced the new recommendations.
“We’ve had a pretty good protocol going. We’ve had clear rules. People know what the rules are. I don’t think they need to sit around confusing things, which is what they’re doing and Bobby Kennedy is doing,” Lamont said Monday morning.
It was unclear then, however, whether the governor’s administration had yet to fully explore its legal authority. Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Lamont, said later Monday that the Bay State’s regulatory structure appeared to give Healey greater authority.
Lamont said he has consulted with New York and Massachusetts about how to continue easy access to inoculations against COVID and other diseases, as recommended by state public health officials.
“I want to speak with one voice when it comes to the vaccines in general, the COVID vaccine in particular,” Lamont said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/D7A7FA27-8AAF-44E7-B471-20E56C5B7B9B-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254

(Official White House Photo by Adam Schultz)LINCOLN – A handful of Nebraska lawmakers are set to travel to Washington, D.C., this week for a “state leadership conference” at the White House’s invitation. 
But, if what happened with delegations from other red states is an indication, another reason for the trip might be for President Donald Trump and his team to lay groundwork for asking another red state to redistrict congressional boundaries to Republican advantage before the 2026 election. 
At least four Nebraska lawmakers confirmed with the Examiner that they are headed to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. The official reason is the leadership conference organized by the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Nebraska and Iowa lawmakers are scheduled to “hear firsthand how President Trump is implementing the America First Agenda,” and how to “advance it at the state and local level.”

When asked about lawmakers’ visit to D.C., Gov Jim Pillen’s office said it wasn’t aware of any White House meeting. 
The four-hour conference could be an opportunity for Trump’s team to discuss possible mid-decade redistricting with Nebraska lawmakers, according to Axios and other political news outlets. National politics website Punchbowl News had already reported Nebraska as a possible target for such a redistricting push. The Axios article mentioned Kansas as well. 
The White House pressed Indiana lawmakers about redistricting during a visit last month to the nation’s capital. Indiana Gov. Mike Braun is widely expected to call a special session this fall, but he has said he wants to hear first from statehouse leaders whether they want to move forward with redistricting.

Last month, retiring Nebraska GOP U.S. Rep. Don Bacon confirmed to the Examiner that preliminary discussions had begun about the Legislature perhaps redrawing the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District to make it harder for Democrats to win. 
While Republicans hold all of Nebraska’s congressional seats, political experts see the now open-seat 2nd District race as a possible pickup for Democrats in 2026.

After the most recent census, when the GOP-led majority in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature redrew the state’s congressional maps, it did so in a way that shored up the 2nd District by swapping some Democratic-leaning residents in suburban Sarpy County with more reliably Republican residents of rural Saunders County. The changes helped maintain the swing district’s slight Republican lean. 
The latest White House push in GOP-led states is part of a national redistricting tit for tat Trump helped start when Texas approved a new map designed to give the GOP up to five additional seats in the U.S. House in next year’s midterms. 
California is trying to combat Texas’s new map with potential changes of its own, as Californians could vote to suspend the state’s current congressional districts, which were drawn by an independent commission, and replace them with a map intended to help Democrats win back the five seats Texas swung the GOP’s way.
The Missouri statehouse also is moving toward a new congressional map that targets its Kansas City-based seat, which could swing it from a heavily Democratic district into a GOP-leaning seat. Ohio is required to redraw its maps this year, which could help the GOP gain two or three seats. Florida recently announced a congressional redistricting committee. 
Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said redrawing districts is “on the table,” and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat leading a Democratic-led state, has said, “we are at war” earlier this year as she explores her own response to Texas. 
The Nebraska Constitution requires redistricting legislation to come after each census, but the language doesn’t specify whether lawmakers can revisit the maps before the next census. It says, “other established lines may be followed at the discretion of the Legislature.” Some have argued any effort to redistrict mid-decade would face legal challenges.
Nebraska lawmakers might lack the numbers needed to make the change. A key indicator: Pillen has failed to pressure enough state lawmakers to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president, even with help from Trump, earlier this year. This, despite Republicans holding a thin supermajority.
Nebraska 1st District U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, a former speaker of the Legislature, told Axios he thinks Republicans lack the votes needed to get redistricting past a filibuster because it lacked the votes to pass the shift to winner-take-all from awarding some electoral votes by congressional district.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)People experiencing homelessness in North Dakota are increasing as the state’s population continues to grow and affordable housing, shelters and resources struggle to keep up with demand.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers funded a study as part of the Industrial Commission budget to look at possible solutions to the issue and held their first hearing on the matter last Thursday during a meeting of the interim Human Services Committee.
Jena Gullo, executive director for the Missouri Slope Areawide United Way in Bismarck, which operates an overnight shelter, said the organization served 531 homeless people last year, a 78% increase compared to data collected in 2020. She added the facility has 42 beds, but typically shelters about 100 people each night with a majority coming from outside of Bismarck-Mandan because of a lack of homeless shelters in the region.
“With the population increasing and the needs increasing, we’re seeing a dramatic increase,” Gullo said. About 32% of those seeking shelter are Native American, she said, an overrepresentation of that demographic group which makes up about 5% of the population in North Dakota.
Chandler Esslinger, executive director of the Fargo-Moorhead Coalition to End Homelessness, said shelters are being “overwhelmed” because people cannot find permanent housing.
“It’s no secret that homelessness has been increasing in Fargo-Moorhead, especially with more people living unsheltered in the community,” Esslinger said. “We know that our system lacks sufficient housing and supportive services and that can keep people trapped in homelessness.”
According to a Legislative Council memo, data showed 784 people were considered homeless, on one night in January 2023 during a point-in-time survey administered by North Dakota Continuum of Care. The number of people considered homeless in North Dakota increased to 865 in 2024 and stayed relatively flat at 861 in 2025 based on the annual one-day counts, according to data collected by North Dakota Continuum of Care.
Legislative Council said identifying the accurate statistics for the number of people experiencing homelessness in North Dakota can be difficult because of differing definitions of homelessness, the mobility of the population, poor data from rural areas and the cyclical nature of homelessness.

Jessica Thomasson, executive director for human services at the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, said the department collected data on rental assistance and homelessness over the past three years. That data shows every county in North Dakota has had someone reach out to the department because they were at risk of losing their housing or they were experiencing homelessness.
“It really is not limited to large population centers,” Thomasson said. “It truly does happen wherever you have people living and working in your communities. Sometimes lifestorms throw you into a housing crisis.”
Over the last three years, nearly 21,000 North Dakotans applied to ND Rent Help for emergency rental assistance or eviction prevention, according to department data. Those residents represent more than 13,000 households with about 31% of those representing families with children under age 18.
The data also showed that at the time the assistance applications were submitted, about 48% of those households were staying with a friend or family member while 25% were staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing unit. Nineteen percent of the households that applied for rent assistance were considered unsheltered when they submitted their applications.
Thomasson told lawmakers that people tend to forget that the most affordable rental units are the most competitive. That means someone who misses out on an affordable unit may sometimes spend more than they can afford to secure housing.
Jennifer Henderson, director of planning and housing development for the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency, said federal guidelines recommend that people spend no more than 30% of their income on housing needs, which is becoming difficult due to increasing rents. 
She said North Dakota has more than 106,000 households that are considered very low to extremely low income, earning less than $23 per hour. The number of households in those categories is expected to increase by 2027.
“When you see rents going to $1,100 plus, per month, there are going to be less and less people that are going to be able to afford those rents based on our projections of income,” Henderson said.
She added about 38% of the job openings in North Dakota pay an average starting wage of under $20 per hour.
Henderson said about 39% of renter households in the state were spending more than 30% of their income on housing compared to 15% of North Dakota homeowners, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The data also showed that 56% of renter households over age 65 were paying more than 30% of their income on housing.
“There’s a lot there to unwind,” said Sen. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, chair of the interim Human Services Committee, at the end of the hearing. “The data for homelessness is an area that I would like to see improve.”
Davison said the committee will begin to define possible homelessness solutions at future meetings over the interim. He also suggested that trying to be more proactive to prevent homelessness before it occurs could be a better use of taxpayer dollars than building shelters.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) has struggled for years to meet its six-person quorum requirement — including waiting an hour for enough council members to show up before finally canceling its most recent meeting on Aug. 26. 
Ironically, the canceled meeting’s agenda included first steps in reducing the number of council members needed to constitute a quorum to four people, based on a new state law. The CRMC is scheduled to try again on Tuesday to begin the rulemaking process that cuts its quorum minimum and also the total number of council members from 10 to seven under a new state law.
Legislation approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly on its final day of the 2025 session and signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee on June 30 mandates the restructuring and new professional qualifications for council members by March 1, 2026. The reduction in quorum from six to four people follows that timeline. 
Three of the 10 council seats are unfilled, meaning that if more than one member does not attend a meeting, the council does not have a quorum.
Acknowledging the challenges the CRMC has faced challenges finding members already, the new state law also gives some flexibility, letting existing council members continue to serve beyond the March 1 deadline if the new panel has not been appointed. 
Coastal watchdogs are keeping a close eye on the transition, worried that, if executed improperly, it could expose the agency to even more lawsuits.
“The concern is if they were to start conducting business meetings with only four members present, any party subject to a decision that didn’t go their way would have a very easy case to make in court that the CRMC was operating outside of what they are allowed to do statutorily,” Michael Woods, chair of the New England chapter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, said in an interview on Monday. “They already get sued enough of the time.”
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, declined to comment.
Woods also submitted a letter to the CRMC on Sept. 5 outlining his concerns. 
The controversial coastal regulatory panel has been plagued by lawsuits challenging its decisions, with aggrieved parties winning court-ordered do-overs because the council did not follow its own rules. 
Devil in the details 
If the agency tries to proceed with meetings with four members present before all seven are confirmed, the CRMC would be breaking its own rules, making them an easy target for legal challenges, advocates say. 
Also of concern to Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, is the appointment of new members. While the law says all seven new members must be seated for the quorum change to take effect, Thorp fears that if at least four new members are confirmed, the council might forge ahead with meetings anyway — again, violating their statutory mandates.
In fairness, no one at the CRMC has stated that this is their plan or intent, Thorp acknowledged.
“I’m not assuming ill intent on the part of the council,” Thorp said. “We just want to be clear and make sure everybody’s on the same page about when this takes effect.”
He continued, “Because we have this track record and history of seats not being appointed as they should be, I don’t have a high level of confidence that the letter of the statute will be followed without prompting.”
McKee’s office, which is in charge of nominating council members to be confirmed by the Rhode Island Senate, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Senate President Valarie Lawson, and Larry Berman, a spokesperson for House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, responded jointly in an email Monday.
“Agency rulemaking is a core executive function,” they said. “We leave it to CRMC to follow the detailed statutory process within the Administrative Procedures Act to develop rules in light of the statutory changes that were passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the Governor in June 2025.”
The coastal regulatory agency has faced mounting public scrutiny, including over its failure to bring sanctions against Quidnessett Country Club for a seawall built without permission along the property line. State regulators issued warnings to the North Kingstown country club more than two years ago, but the 600-foot-long rock wall remains, and fines or other penalties have yet to be imposed. Instead, the council has given multiple deadline extensions to the country club to come up with a plan for  removing the wall and restoring the shoreline to its natural state.
Thorp and Woods both urged lawmakers to take more sweeping reform measures, backing legislation that, if passed, would have abolished the politically appointed council and reshaped the agency as an administrative body, akin to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The pair of bills failed to advance out of legislative committees for a third consecutive year amid cost concerns cited by legislative leaders. 
Lawmakers opted on more modest changes to council membership and reduced the quorum as a compromise that supporters said would bring more professionalism. The law requires the CRMC to begin the rule change process within 30 days, but does not set a deadline for when the new rules have to be finalized.
Dwyer did not respond to questions regarding the schedule. The Tuesday hearing offers a chance for in-person public comment on the revised rules, with written comments accepted through Sept. 30.

But once it’s split up, it’s not nearly as much. Is the state doing enough?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Sasha Allen to discuss her article, “Funding for special ed in CT got a bump this year, but is it enough?” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Sasha’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Sasha. The underfunding of special education in Connecticut has been a perennial problem. This year, state lawmakers attempted to tackle it and passed a bill that would provide about $70 million in new funding, part of which will go to a special education expansion and Development Grant Program for school districts over the next couple of years. Is that why you decided to look into this issue? And why did you find it important to focus on Bridgeport special education teacher Lisa Balzano?
SA: Yeah, I guess that’s kind of how I got interested in it. When I saw that they had passed the bill, which would add additional money, I heard some of the discourse around it. People were calling it, you know, emergency money that was passed last session, and then the new grants seemed like they were important. And so I decided to look more into it. And I got to talking to some teachers. Lisa was one of them, and I thought her story was particularly interesting because she was like a die-hard Bridgeport teacher through and through; she didn’t want to leave. I looked into it, and I don’t think this was in the article, but I looked into some teacher salaries in different districts throughout the state. And, you know, she could have moved to a district where she would have made a lot more money if she wanted to, but she decided to stay in Bridgeport because she loved the kids and stuff, so that’s why I decided to talk to her.
And the issue itself just seemed much more, much more important than it did on the surface. You know, when I saw that they passed the bill to add additional money, I was like, Okay, maybe this money is necessary. But as I kept looking, I saw, you know, more and more complaints from parents and advocates about how their kids were being treated in special education, and a lot of it came down to the fact that there wasn’t enough money to give them the support that they were legally entitled to. So yeah, that’s why I decided to look into it. I thought it was important.
WSHU: An interesting incident was when Lisa Balzano went to a school in Fairfield, and she opened a storeroom and saw how much material they had. So just tell us a little bit about Lisa’s experience being a special ed teacher in Bridgeport, and how it was so different when she went just down the street to a school in Fairfield.
SA: Yeah, so she told me this, this is one of the first things she told me when we started talking, because I was asking her about what her experience was like, and she was like, Well, this is something that’s really stuck with me. Two years ago, I went to this school, also in Fairfield County, and opened it. She said it wasn’t a supply closet. She said it was a supply room, and she opened the door to a supply room where they had literally anything, pens, paper, pencils, markers, so many school supplies that she is always buying for her students herself out of pocket. She said that teachers get a small stipend every year for money to spend on supplies. And I think that’s consistent throughout the state, but she said this school supplied it for their teachers; their teachers didn’t have to go out and buy as much stuff as she had to buy. And I thought that that was a really good insight into what it’s like to teach in a Bridgeport school versus a school in a more affluent community. And it was a good segue into the fact that, oh, she’s also having so many more students on her caseload, because there are fewer teachers, because fewer people want to teach there.
WSHU: Now $70 million seems like a lot of money to put into this. Where exactly will that money go, and how much of a difference will it make?
SA: Yeah, so that’s the question that I had when I saw that they were adding the $70 million. I talked to many people, and many people were saying, This is a great start, but I don’t think that it’s enough. That was kind of the consensus that I got, because there’s just so much need throughout the state, and $70 million is a lot of money when you’re looking at it, but when you have to distribute it throughout the entire state to each district. Districts aren’t getting the amount of money that they need, especially districts like Bridgeport, where, you know, they’re trying to build out a new special education program there that would act as a kind of intervention instead of having to send students away. But you know, they’re still spending so much more money, or they still need so much more money than they would be getting, and a lot of this money is the money that they’re distributing this fiscal year through the seed grant. And I think, I believe it’s $30 million.
WSHU: $30 million each year for the next couple of years.
SA: Yes, yeah. So $30 million for this year, and then $30 million next year, and then they’re doing $9.9 million for an additional grant. So this year, when you think about it, $30 million was distributed to all of the districts in the state. That’s not a ton of money. Some districts are getting $125 for their special education program under the seed grant this year. So when you think about how much money that is, you can’t really do a lot with that.
WSHU: And at this same time, we’re also seeing an increase in the number of students who qualify for special education. It’s gone up quite a bit over the last 15 years.
Yeah, this is a nationwide trend. There are so many more students in special education than there used to be. It’s risen, I believe 3% or 4% I can, I can check the number, but it’s risen a lot in Connecticut. On top of that, special education costs way more. The costs have risen.
WSHU: What’s driving the cost increase?
SA: That’s a good question. I talked to a bunch of people about this. They say it’s a combination of just rising costs generally throughout the nation. Still, special education is rising at a much higher level than other costs for other educational needs, one of the major costs in special education in Connecticut is transportation, because we out place a lot of our students. Hence, transportation is just generally getting more expensive, and transporting special education students does cost a lot.
WSHU: But part of this grant program is to try to have school districts bring some of those programs that they’re taking the kids to other districts back into districts so they have those programs within their districts. Are there any school districts that intend to do something with that money to bring services back into their districts?
SA: Yeah, I haven’t seen anything set in stone specifically regarding the seed grant money, but there have been a lot of talks about collaboration with other districts. I’m sure that there’s a lot of ideas floating around about that, and that seemed like the general consensus when I was talking to teachers and when I was talking to special education directors throughout the state, they were all saying that they wanted to use this money to create lower level intervention so that they don’t have to send every student whose needs exceed the needs that they can offer in their schools out to us, like private, specialized facility. We heard from a few people. I think there was a mayor, I believe it was Shelton, and he said that he wanted to use some of the money to create a system for a lower-level intervention. So we’ve heard some stuff about this money. Specifically, I don’t think right now there’s anything set in stone to build a lower-level intervention. I will say that in Bridgeport, they have a bunch of money, and they are building a new school to which they’re going to add intervention. It should hold a ton of students, and it would really help their outplacement numbers.
WSHU: So basically, the bottom line is, there’s more money, but it might not be enough.
SA: Yeah, and when I was talking to everyone, they all said this, but their hope is that this is going to kick-start the state sending in more money when they see that this money is working. And there are, I believe, plans to increase the grant after fiscal year 27. I think that’s what they were hoping to do. But yeah, everyone is just hopeful that this is the beginning of more money for special education.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BRIDGEPORT-SPED-COMPLAINT-0807-DE-004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254

But the ACLU of Montana said the state could have substituted the judge — for any reason — early on in the case, and its motion is a “baseless attack on the judiciary.”
A brief arguing for the judge’s removal and citing the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct identifies one shared article on Facebook in 2017 and accounts the judge follows on Instagram as key features among the information it argues should disqualify him.
“Judges should maintain the dignity of judicial office at all times, and avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in their professional and personal lives,” reads the brief.
But the ACLU of Montana said most of the “purported evidence” is many years old — available to the state well before the lawsuit even started — and the state relinquished its chance to remove the judge with its “unreasonable delay.”
“They waited more than five months — only after the judge had granted a preliminary injunction against them, they had filed an appeal, and the trial court had entered a scheduling order — before seeking disqualification,” argued the ACLU of Montana.
Attempts to swap judges are common in Montana district courts, but “bumping” a judge happens earlier in a proceeding, and those motions to “substitute” are automatically granted, according to a University of Montana law school faculty member.
This motion is different. It’s a motion to “disqualify for cause,” and such motions are rarely granted, according to the Clerk of the Montana Supreme Court.
Attorney General spokespeople Emilee Cantrell and Chase Scheuer did not respond to a question about why the state did not move to replace the judge early on in the case.
Vannatta is overseeing Perkins vs. State of Montana, a lawsuit where the plaintiffs, including transgender and intersex Montanans, argue House Bill 121 violates their rights to equal protection, privacy and ability to pursue life’s basic necessities.
HB 121 restricts access to public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping spaces based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth. The bill sponsor and other supporters, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, argue it adds protection and safety for women.
  Argument to disqualify 

In the court filing to disqualify Vannatta, Attorney General Austin Knudsen and lawyers for the state argue the alignment between an article the judge shared on social media and his own reasoning demonstrates bias.
The state also alleges groups the judge follows and his affiliation with the American Bar Association’s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Commission are “external influences” that could improperly affect his judgement.
Additionally, the state argues the social media activity of his spouse is evidence Vannatta should be disqualified.
On Facebook in 2017, Vannatta shared a TIME Magazine story called “Gender Laws Are at Odds with Science,” according to the court record. It said the story argues “the legal recognition of only two biological sexes is ‘incongruous with science.’”
Vannatta posted the story, said it was a “fascinating article authored by a California judge,” and “liked” comments agreeing with the article, the court filing said.
“This post, comment and ostensible agreement with other comments may not have held much significance in 2017, but years later and in the context of litigation Judge Vannatta determined he could preside over, they bring on new significance that raise reasonable questions about bias and impartiality,” the court record said.
Vannatta took office two years later in 2019 as the state’s 49th district court judge, the youngest judge in the district, and the first openly gay judge to serve in the state, according to a Missoulian story.
As a judge, the court brief said Vannatta made arguments that align with the “viewpoints” in the TIME article and show his “judicial reasoning was driven by personal political beliefs rather than neutral legal analysis.”
Many scientists define sex as not exclusively male or female. The American Medical Association says roughly one in 50 births are variations, or intersex, and based on numerous factors.
Other members of the health care community including researchers with the Yale School of Medicine say genetic, hormonal or anatomical variations can make a person’s sex ambiguous. The topic has been frequently in the news and is a subject of numerous scientific journal articles.
The motion did not point to other posts by Vannatta, but it said the groups he follows on Instagram, such as “The Dark Left,” show a progressive bent, and “reasonable observers” could interpret Vannatta as partisan as a result.
It said the American Bar Association commission on which he sat “has direct ties” to the American Civil Liberties Union, pointing to a link on the commission’s website to transgender resources. The list named legal and advocacy organizations including the ACLU.
It said the ACLU is representing the plaintiffs, so Vannatta should recuse himself in such cases.
  ‘If you dig hard enough,’ you can allege bias, law professor says 

The University of Montana School of Law’s Constance Van Kley said it can be challenging to look at standards for disqualification, but she also said it isn’t difficult to allege bias.
“If you dig hard enough for just about anybody on some of the significant constitutional issues of the day, you can find something that you could at least allege demonstrates bias,” Van Kley said.
She also said many people allege bias because they don’t get the result they want — but that’s not enough to disqualify a judge.
In May, Vannatta granted a preliminary injunction, pausing enforcement of the bill by the state until the case fully plays out in court.
Vannatta said transgender Montanans have been subjected to unequal treatment in the last three legislative sessions. He also said the state had not provided evidence, so far, of how transgender females threaten female privacy and safety.
But Van Kley, a constitutional scholar, said a judge can hold competing views.
“Having a view on the political merit of legislation is not the same thing as having a view on its constitutionality,” Van Kley said. “We trust judges to make those determinations. That’s their job.”
Van Kley also said views vary on where to draw the line for when judges should hear a case or step aside.
In recent challenges to U.S. Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas overseeing matters in which they had personal connections, the court said if a conflict of interest doesn’t exist, and a justice can hear a case, then the justice must hear the case, Van Kley said.
“That’s one perspective, but it’s not the only perspective,” Van Kley said.
Others believe that even if an appearance of impropriety exists, a judge should step down to prevent distrust in the process of the judiciary, she said — the argument the state made in its motion to disqualify Vannatta.
But how do you measure it?
“Is it enough for one party to say you appear biased to me? Because you can get a lawyer willing to say that in a lot of cases,” Van Kley said.
  Arguments to let the case proceed 

The ACLU of Montana said the state waited too long to try to replace the judge, and it only did so after he’d ruled against them by temporarily stopping the bill from taking effect.
It said the state could have invoked its right to substitute the judge within 30 days of the first summons being served or adverse party appearing, and the timeline “serves a crucial purpose.”
“It conserves judicial economy by ensuring judges are substituted before the case and the judge’s familiarity with it have developed, and it permits litigation to proceed according to orderly schedules without interruption,” said the ACLU of Montana.
But it said “no-cause” substitution also “prevents gamesmanship and politicization of cases to the detriment of the orderly administration of justice.”
The information the state relies on is so old, predating the judge’s appointment to the bench, or already cited in the state’s own cases, the state should have found it “with reasonable diligence,” the ACLU of Montana said.
The ACLU also said typically, disqualification for cause is more time-consuming than substitution, because the chief justice assigns it to a different district court judge, who must restart the hearings, often delaying the process.
“Defendants have attempted to set this protracted process in motion in the middle of discovery and a case schedule that Defendants themselves requested move expeditiously to trial,” the ACLU wrote. “… In short, Defendants’ motion is disruptive, dilatory, and wasteful of judicial resources.”
Typically, motions to disqualify are handled within days, but a timeline isn’t set, according to Clerk of Court Bowen Greenwood. Greenwood said the request is in the hands of the chief justice and was pending early Monday afternoon.
In the meantime, the Perkins case is on hold, Van Kley said.
“Nobody can hear the merits of the case until this (motion to disqualify) gets resolved,” Van Kley said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1488675709-1024x662.jpg,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey appeals court rejected a constitutional challenge to the state’s school funding formula on Monday, finding that other problems in the district prevent Lakewood public school students from receiving the “thorough and efficient” education guaranteed by the state’s constitution.
The three-judge panel found financial mismanagement, a failure to raise taxes, and heavy spending on transportation and special education for more than 50,000 private school students who are not included in the funding formula’s calculations are clearer causes for the district’s faltering public schools.
“Petitioners, in effect, ask us to declare the [funding formula] unconstitutional because it doesn’t yield enough state aid to cover the shortfalls caused by Lakewood’s budget and spending choices, particularly in the areas of transportation and special education,” the judges wrote. “These choices, the record shows, have drained resources away from Lakewood’s public school students.”
The decision is the latest in an 11-year legal saga over the sufficiency of public school education in Lakewood, a fast-growing Ocean County township with a large Orthodox Jewish community where children are nearly all enrolled in private religious schools.
Arthur Lang, an attorney who represented district parents and a former Lakewood public schools teacher, called the panel’s decision wrong and said his clients would ask the New Jersey Supreme Court to hear the case.
“You can’t provide mandated services such as transportation and special education for 50,000 kids on a budget designed for 5,000 kids,” Lang said. “There is no way in the world that mismanagement can be the reason for the hundreds of millions of dollars of debt.”
Paul Tractenberg, another attorney for the plaintiffs, criticized the ruling as one that seems to “accept uncritically” the state’s defense and improperly shifts responsibility for funding shortcomings from the state to Lakewood’s district.
Lakewood, New Jersey’s fifth-most populous municipality, had a tax base of just over $11.2 billion in 2024, the 11th largest in the state, but 445 school districts levied school taxes at greater rates than Lakewood, according to Department of Community Affairs property tax data.
The township’s 1.032% school property tax rate fell below the state average of 1.376% in 2024, the most recent year for which property tax data is available.
The district’s proposed budget for the 2025-26 school year includes a loan of just over $100 million from the state government, which would follow a $144.2 million loan in the prior year and a $50 million loan in the year before that. The district expects to spend about $413.4 million this school year.
In October 2024, the district had fewer than 5,000 enrolled public school students, including 1,072 full-time students with special needs. The district earlier this year said more than 50,000 students were enrolled in Lakewood private schools, including more than 10,000 who lived in outlying municipalities.
State law requires districts to provide busing to students who live at least 2 miles away from their school, or 2.5 miles for high school students. Under federal law, school districts are required to provide for special education services to public and nonpublic school students.
The Lakewood school district expected to receive $17.9 million in state transportation aid for the 2025-2026 school year, but forecasted it would spend just over $48 million on student transportation.
In some years, more than half of the Lakewood schools’ total budget went to transportation and special education expenses that typically account for a much smaller share of a district’s total spending.
Lang rejected the argument that raising local taxes would fix the problem.
“Even if they taxed to the maximum based on the wealth, it’s still not enough money,” Lang said.
The case began in 2014 when parents of public school students lodged an administrative appeal over Lakewood’s school aid award, arguing New Jersey’s school funding formula prevented a thorough and efficient education, to which courts have said New Jersey’s students are constitutionally entitled.
An administrative law judge in 2021 found that students were being deprived of a thorough and efficient education, but said the funding formula did not play a significant role in that deficiency.
A final decision issued by then-Education Commissioner Angelica Allen-McMillan in 2024 found that low local taxes, fiscal mismanagement, and staggering special education and transportation expenses were a clearer cause of the district’s distress.
“The causes are well-documented, and quite frankly, hard to miss,” the judges wrote in Monday’s ruling. “The consistent pattern of neglect and misfeasance by various elected and appointed Lakewood school leaders with respect to critical governance, finance, curriculum, transportation, and special education recommendations made by respondents over the years lends an aura of deliberate indifference to these proceedings.”

Patrick Morrisey speaks at a news conference Monday announcing the state received 2,500 donated signs reading “In God We Trust” for schools. (Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)West Virginia has officially received 2,500 donated signs reading “In God We Trust” for schools to hang up in order to meet requirements set in a new law passed during the 2025 regular session.
Senate Bill 280 required all public primary and secondary schools, as well as institutions of higher education, to display the United States motto in a “conspicuous location” in a main building of the school that is accessible to the public.
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood, and became law this year after being introduced in the Legislature but failing to pass for several years previously. Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, celebrated the law’s passage at a bill signing in April. The law went into effect on July 11.
SB 280 did not include any mechanism to fund purchasing the motto displays.
Azinger said at a news conference Monday that some schools have already displayed the motto by making their own posters or accepting private donations. Per state code, the displays must be at least 8.5 by 11 inches and include the U.S. flag centered under “In God We Trust.” No other information shall be on the posters.
The donated signs — which come from Patriot Mobile, a self-described “Christian conservative wireless provider,” and First Liberty Institute, a legal organization defending “religious freedom” — will now be sent out to school districts to be hung up.
Monday’s news conference included remarks from Morrisey, who said the posters are critical for students to “understand the importance of basic civics and ensuring we’re recognizing our God in schools.”
“Religious freedom must and will be respected in West Virginia,” Morrisey said. “Thank you and God bless.”
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, said he is a “firm believer that society started going downhill when we took God out of our schools.”
“I think we have statistics to show that,” Smith said.
He did not share what statistics he was referencing.
Other speakers Monday included state lawmakers and national conservative Christian advocates. 
Andrea Justus, with First Liberty, urged lawmakers in West Virginia to next pass a law to display the Ten Commandments in schools as well as at the state Capitol.
“First Liberty can help with best-practice language there,” Justus said as she winked toward lawmakers standing nearby. “We’d love to see the Ten Commandments displayed in every classroom in West Virginia.”
Bills to do such in public schools have been introduced in West Virginia over the last several years, however they’ve never made it out of the committee process.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/morrisey-in-god-we-trust-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254

Gov Howie Morales, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Early Childhood Education and Care Department Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky announced the state will implement a universal free child care system during a news conference on Sept. 8 in Santa Fe. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico will offer child care at no cost to all residents, regardless of incomes, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced on Monday, thus becoming the first U.S. state to offer universal free child care, she said.
The state Early Childhood Education and Care Department will begin writing rules to entirely remove the income eligibility threshold for a family to receive child care assistance by Nov. 1. The state currently waives parent copays on child care for families whose income is up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
The free child care will save families on average $12,000 annually, the governor’s office said, and be available to parents regardless of whether they are working full-time or in school.
During Monday’s news conference, Lujan Grisham said reaching the milestone of free universal child care required asking the Legislature and New Mexico voters for sustainable sources of funding. New Mexico voters in 2022 passed a Constitutional Amendment that pushed state lawmakers to tap into a state fund and use it to build out the early childhood education system in the state. 
“That was always the vision,” she said. “It took us this long to realize it, but by golly, we did.”
Along with the expanded access to free child care, the state in one week will allow entities like local governments and schools to start applying for low-interest loans to expand or create new child care facilities, under expanded rules to the state’s Child Care Facility Loan Fund passed in the most recent legislative session, Early Childhood Education and Care Department Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky said.
Between 12,000 and 13,000 new child care slots will open up as a result of 55 new licensed child care centers, 120 new licensed homes and 1,000 new registered homes, she noted.
“We see the interest, we’re also talking to industry leaders who are very interested in this, and also school superintendents,” Groginsky said. “I think it’s an all-in strategy from industry, business leaders, our schools and our community-based providers.”
Lujan Grisham said universal child care is “the backbone of creating a system of support for families” that allow parents to go to work or college.
“It’s going to make New Mexico extremely attractive to build your business here,” Lujan Grisham said. “It’s going to make New Mexico extremely attractive to come here and raise your family.”
The new rule will also address pay for child care providers, the governor said. According to a handout at Monday’s news conference, under the proposed rule, providers will earn additional funding if they pay all entry-level workers at least $18 to $21 per hour and remain open at least 10 hours per day, five days per week.
Monday’s announcement builds on six years of progress in the state, said Dr. Neal Halfon, founding director of the University of California Los Angeles Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities. He said New Mexico is the first U.S. state to put in place a blueprint for “an ecosystem of early childhood supports,” including a first-of-its-kind statewide comprehensive, actionable data program.
“This portfolio of strategies — I’m telling you as an outsider — is a really big deal,” Halfson said. “As a developmental scientist, we’d like to see every place have this kind of scaffolding in place. This is a national model.”
In the most recent legislative session, lawmakers increased the department’s budget by $113 million to $995 million total, including $463 million specifically for child care, Groginsky said. The state also created a new pot of money called the Early Childhood Education Fund which started at $320 million and now has $10 billion, Lt. Gov. Howie Morales said during the news conference.

A rare chain reaction along the southern flank of the Wind River Range exemplifies thousands of lethal wildlife-vehicle collisions that occur on Wyoming highways each year.
The post Four bears down: South Pass’s cautionary tale of how roadkill begets more roadkill appeared first on WyoFile .","The initial roadkill reported to Brian Debolt on South Pass was pretty routine.
A westbound motorist heading toward Farson had careened into an elk, now lying dead in the ditch near mile marker 54 of the thoroughfare that generally follows the route of the historic Oregon Trail. 
“I got a call at like 2 o’clock in the morning,” said DeBolt, the Lander-based large carnivore conflict coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “If it’s dead and it’s off the road, it’s usually not our concern.” 
Carcasses in highway right-of-ways — which can amass in shocking numbers — are typically collected by the Wyoming Department of Transportation. 
Two days after the early morning Aug. 31 report came in, DeBolt received another call that made the elk carcass his concern. 
“I get another call from our dispatch that a passerby had reported three dead bears,” he recounted. “I go up there and sure enough, there’s a sow and two young cubs, obviously struck by vehicles. I’m sure it happened all at once.” 
A family of black bears — a sow and two cubs — is dead and strewn on the side of the highway following collisions at the site of an elk carcass on South Pass on Sept. 2, 2025. The yellow 4 marks the location of the elk, obscured by grass. Another black bear was hit at the site later the same day. (Brian DeBolt/Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
DeBolt loaded the family of dead bruins into the bed of his pickup truck. He left the rotting wapiti, already having three carcasses on board. 
Later that evening, the carnivore biologist took another call from dispatch: another report of a black bear struck and killed at the same Highway 28 mile marker. 
“I’m like, ‘No, that happened this morning,’” DeBolt recalled saying. 
But via the dispatcher, he learned that the man who struck the bear was up there right then. He called the motorist and confirmed.
“I went back up there. Sure enough, another bear was down right at the elk carcass,” DeBolt said. “That time I did go ahead and pick up the elk carcass.” 
The fourth bear lured to its death by roadside venison in less than 24 hours marked the end of the unusual incident. But to DeBolt, it was a reminder of why it’s important to report and clean up roadkill that accumulates daily along Wyoming’s roads. 
“It creates a safety hazard, and not only for people,” DeBolt said. “Also, just other animals.” 
Although black bears being struck while feeding on road-killed carcasses might be relatively rare, DeBolt said he’s seen the chain reaction from a collision claim other species before. 
“It’s mostly coyotes and magpies and ravens and other small scavengers,” he said. 

(Wyoming chapter of The Nature Conservancy)
Those opportunistic scavengers have plenty of biomass drawing them in. Wildlife-vehicle collisions doubled in Wyoming over a recent 15-year period, according to a 2022 report from the Wyoming chapter of The Nature Conservancy.
“If we conservatively estimate that the true number of animals hit by vehicles is two times the number counted, then we may be losing 15,000 big-game animals, mostly mule deer, to wildlife–vehicle collisions per year,” author Corinna Riginos wrote. 
Only a tiny fraction of the road-killed wildlife earns any publicity. Black bears and grizzlies — including world-famous Grizzly 399 — have proven the rare exceptions, garnering headlines after accidents and reminding motorists of the scores of animals struck and killed by vehicles every year on Wyoming roadways.

Free.,US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-oks-racial-profiling-los-angeles-immigration-enforcement,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court’s ban on immigration agents' racial profiling of Latinos in Southern California, backing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdownThe order is temporary as the suit continues in lower courts, but it indicates a majority of the court is likely to side with the Trump administration’s defense against a complaint that targeting Latino and Spanish-speaking workers for immigration enforcement violated the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment that bars unreasonable search and seizure.The high court ruled that the officers could use “apparent ethnicity” as one factor in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it is not the only factor.“Whether an officer has reasonable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.“Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English,” he continued.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latin American member of the court, wrote a scathing dissent that the two other liberal justices, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined.“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also slammed Monday’s decision from the Supreme Court. “Today, the highest court in the country ruled that the White House and masked federal agents can racially profile Angelenos with no due process, snatch them off the street with no evidence or warrant, and take them away with no explanation,” she said in a statement. “This decision will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect – not persecute – our people.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the decision from the high court will cause “racial terror in Los Angeles.” “Trump's private police force now has a green light to come after your family — and every person is now a target — but we will continue fighting these abhorrent attacks on Californians,” Newsom, a Democrat, said.Temporary rulingThe ruling responded to an emergency appeal the administration made to the court last month, seeking to put on hold a temporary restraining order from Central California U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong. The case in the lower court is ongoing.The lower court blocked immigration agents from using “apparent ethnicity"" as a method for determining if an individual violated immigration law. Agents used a broad variety of factors to determine someone’s apparent ethnicity, including speaking Spanish or accented English, certain types of work and locations such as bus stops or car washes.Kavanaugh also said that the civil rights groups and individuals targeted by immigration agents who brought the suit against the Department of Homeland Security lacked legal standing for the challenge “to seek a broad injunction restricting immigration officers from making these investigative stops.”‘Fair game to be seized at any time’Sotomayor penned the dissent, criticizing Monday’s order for violating Fourth Amendment rights and allowing Latinos to be racially profiled.“The Government, and now the concurrence, has all but declared that all Latinos, U. S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction,” she continued. And she questioned Kavanaugh’s assumption that anyone who is a U.S. citizen and is questioned by an immigration officer will simply be let go once their citizenship is explained.“That blinks reality,” she wrote, noting that two U.S. citizen plaintiffs in the suit tried to explain their citizenship status to an immigration officer. “One was then pushed against a fence with his arms twisted behind his back, and the other was taken away from his job to a warehouse for further questioning,” she wrote. Sotomayor said the decision would create a second-class citizen status and require people to carry around proof of citizenship or legal status.She added that the Fourth Amendment “prohibits exactly what the Government is attempting to do here: seize individuals based solely on a set of facts that ‘describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent’ people.”“The Fourth Amendment protects every individual’s constitutional right to be ‘free from arbitrary interference by law officers,’” she wrote. “After today, that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little.”National Guard responds to protests over tacticsThe administration’s mass raids this summer on Los Angeles-area Home Depot stores and other sites where day laborers gather sparked massive protests in the city that were the basis of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines deploying to the city, over Newsom's objection. A federal judge last week said the military members’ conduct violated a law against military personnel conducting domestic law enforcement.The president has also deployed the National Guard of the District of Columbia and has directed thousands of federal law enforcement officers to set up checkpoints in the city to inquire about immigration status. Thousands in the district on Saturday protested the deployment. Further deployments?The president has threatened to send National Guard members to more predominantly Democratic cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Portland, Oregon. He has said those deployments would  help contain crime — despite violent crime in those cities decreasing in recent years — while also highlighting immigration enforcement.Trump over the weekend posted an artificial intelligence-generated image that referenced the Vietnam War film “Apocalypse Now.” The image is of Trump in a military uniform in front of the Chicago skyline with flames in the background. The caption read: “I love the smell of deportations in the morning… Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” referring to the new secondary name Trump gave the Defense Department on Friday. Speaking at an event at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., Monday morning, Trump said that he “would love to go into Chicago” but was waiting on a request from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker before he sent troops there. Pritzker, a Democrat, has been adamant that the city did not need or want National Guard troops.",,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rob Morgan, owner and publisher of the Neodesha Derrick News in southeast Kansas, knew something wasn’t right when four subscriptions in a row were canceled.
All four, he noticed, were being delivered to correctional facilities.
“Four subscribers — that’s a big hit,” Morgan said. “I hate to say that.”
The Kansas Department of Corrections, which oversees all youth and adult detention facilities, changed without notice its department-wide newspaper subscription policy on Aug. 27, blindsiding newspaper publishers across Kansas.
Previously, families of incarcerated people could take out a newspaper subscription in a person’s name and have it delivered to a state facility. The agency says it made the change, forbidding newspaper subscriptions paid for by outside parties, for safety.
But for those serving time, a subscription can act as a tether to reality while inside a Kansas prison’s walls.
One person at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility had a subscription to the Neodesha paper through his parents, Morgan said.
“He looks forward to that because his children get in the paper from time to time,” he said.
Morgan is a self-described “little guy” and a one-man operation. The weekly paper stays away from politics and reports on community happenings for about 300 print subscribers and roughly 150 online subscribers in and around Wilson County.
Another man serving time had a subscription to the Neodesha Derrick News that was purchased by his mother and paid for through 2027. She has since died, and Morgan doesn’t quite know what to do. Two of the four canceled subscriptions have been rerouted to the families of people in prison, but Morgan said he has not received any requests from inside the Kansas prison system to restore access to the Neodesha Derrick News.
Emily Bradbury, executive director of the Kansas Press Association, alerted association members to the canceled newspaper subscriptions the day after the policy went into effect.
Following the change, this year’s subscriptions will not be honored, and incarcerated individuals must jump through hoops to regain access to credible local information, Bradbury said.
“Creating barriers to real information is not beneficial to the newspaper or to the inmate,” Bradbury said in an interview. “If the whole goal is to re-assimilate these inmates back into society when they’ve done their time, how are they going to know what’s going on?”
The new policy requires people serving time in state facilities to request a subscription on their own, undergo an approval process and pay for the subscription out of their commissary accounts.
David Thompson, a spokesman for the state corrections department, said it “takes the safety and well-being of its residents seriously.”
“The policy was updated primarily to enhance KDOC’s ability to protect residents and employees from dangerous contraband. This policy change applies to physical subscriptions only — digital access to newspapers remains unchanged,” Thompson said.
The policy singles out newspapers, making no mention of magazines or other periodicals.
Max Kautsch, the media hotline attorney for press association members, said the corrections department must show why the policy change and canceling existing subscriptions were necessary to protect residents.
“The real smoking gun here is that the publishers of the newspapers were never notified of the possibility that their subscribers would not be able to consume their publication,” he said. “The case law is very clear that publishers do have a due process right to know if that is going to happen.”
How community newspapers pose a threat to prison operations is unclear. However, Thompson said Monday that the new process has gone smoothly. Multiple newspaper subscriptions have been approved, and more are in the process. The only rejections thus far were related to payment issues or a publication’s inability to meet certain verification requirements, such as direct receipts, packing slips or labels allowing a newspaper issue to be tracked, Thompson said.
“Resident access to information is important to KDOC, and this policy is not designed to reject publications,” he said. “Rather, it aims to streamline ordering through approved vendors while maintaining safety standards.”
The suddenness of the decision bothered Bradbury, who has led the press association for eight years.
She wondered: “What could we have done to solve this instead of creating this burdensome, bureaucratic process for someone to go about getting a product that would educate them about what’s happening in their communities?”
Bradbury also said the press association was exploring all of its options in how to respond to the policy change.
Surrounding states have similar restrictions, but their policies don’t single out newspapers.
In Nebraska, printed materials, including magazines, newspapers and other periodicals, must be delivered directly from a publisher. Incarcerated individuals can submit orders for subscription materials in any month and aren’t subject to the typical four-order limit, according to Nebraska Department of Corrections policies.
In Oklahoma, the state cannot “implement a prohibition on any materials that inmates may receive by subscription, such as a magazine, newspaper, or other similar type of periodical,” according to Oklahoma Department of Corrections policy. Each issue delivered to an Oklahoma facility has to be reviewed to ensure it doesn’t violate the agency’s correspondence restrictions, which include materials containing instructions about drug or arms manufacturing, survival guide information, advocacy for overthrowing a government, sexually explicit materials, or encouraging criminal activity.
Thompson said the department is “fully engaged with residents to handle any issues that may arise.”
Bradbury, who didn’t receive an explanation from the state for why the policy changed, said she would like to see a return to the old policy. Kautsch said any fix must involve a content-neutral policy that serves a legitimate penological interest.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P7251437-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-08 16:58:20.886254

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When I began my career as an elementary school teacher, back-to-school time was filled with anxieties about busy school schedules, homework policies and how to make learning fun and effective. But now teachers are kept up at night worrying about how they’d keep a class full of kids safe if a gunman comes to their school. As a human shield, they can only cover a few small children.
This year, two mass shootings in two days  — at Annunciation School and near Cristo Rey Jesuit High School —  has left Minnesota’s Twin Cities reeling from horrific acts of violence and wondering how we can protect our children and families from this public health crisis.
It will take law enforcement time to learn the details and lessons of these shootings. What we already know is that this problem is something we must tackle. There is not one simple fix. As Minneapolis Mayor Frey said, we cannot meet this overwhelming problem with a shrug. Every sector of our society can commit to a solution in their wheelhouse and here’s ours, as educators: School districts can lead the task of educating families on how to save lives.
We need to treat gun violence like the public health problem it is and communicate to our school communities and loved ones about the importance of identifying warning signs, intervention and the life-saving act of secure storage of firearms. As a country, we’ve solved big public health challenges before. In the early 1980s, less than 20% of drivers wore seat belts – now that number is over 90%. Seat belt use is up and traffic fatalities are down.
In a nation with more guns than people, anyone and everyone who owns a firearm can commit to secure storage of that weapon. Incidents in schools are far too common.
Virginia parents were charged after their six-year-old son took an unsecured firearm to school in his backpack. It was discharged in the classroom. Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt.
Teachers do not have a seat at the table when it comes to gun violence prevention and protocols on the national, local and district level. But they should. Teachers are trusted messengers and experts on kids: 61% of Americans view teachers as “highly” trusted and credible – the 2nd-highest rating among all professions, according to a 2025 Gallup survey.
As a survivor of the tragic Sandy Hook school shooting that took the lives of 20 students and six adults, I know just how tragic and enduring these tragedies are and the challenging aftermath ahead for the families, survivors and educators impacted. We live in a country where there are an average of 57 incidents of gun violence every day in America in or near schools, and where firearms remain the leading cause of death for children and teens.
Teachers and staff are on the frontlines of community and school gun violence and they wear many hats as first responders. They’re counselors when gun violence impacts neighborhoods, nurses when kids are sick from the fear and stress when shootings unfold near and afar, clergy when students need reminders of resiliency and safety.
More than 397,000 kids have been impacted by gun violence since Columbine. As teachers, we lack a playbook for how to care when one of them ends up in your classroom, nor how to teach kids who are unavailable for learning due to trauma, how to restore routine when the entire school has been impacted, how to prepare the class for an injured student’s return, or how to explain a child will never come back to class.
In 2023, Minnesota legislators passed a “red flag” law and universal background checks, but even states with the best gun laws on the books need robust education to the community, especially when it comes to safe firearm storage.
Minnesota school districts can prioritize communicating to parents about tips for safe firearms storage and empower teachers to be part of these messages. And they can do so multiple times throughout the year.
We have a choice: We can continue on, like normal where nothing ever changes, and our students, teachers, parents and communities continue to live with the pain of horrific violence. Or we can get to work.

Ron DeSantis speaking in Plant City on Sept. 8, 2025 (Photo by Dave Deacon for the Florida Phoenix)PLANT CITY — Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday offered a sneak peek at two priorities for the 2026 legislative session — both of which revamp proposals he unsuccessfully pushed this year: eliminating vaccine mandates and allowing open-carry of firearms.
During a press conference here, DeSantis defended his administration’s proposal last week to eliminate from rule and statute all vaccine mandates. State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made the announcement, arguing mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.”  
Ladapo acknowledged to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” over the weekend that the state had conducted no studies before deciding to eliminate vaccine mandates.
DeSantis on Monday came out strong in defense of Ladapo.
“He never said he’d take away availability [of vaccines]. Obviously that’s not his position. But I think his position is if you provide information and persuasion, that’s better than coercion.”
DeSantis, who initially embraced the COVID-19 vaccine and deviated from the federal distribution plan to make sure they were given in Florida first to seniors, fell back on familiar rhetoric about the federal government’s handling of vaccine and mask mandates and government shutdowns, and instead touted Florida’s approach to the pandemic.
DeSantis alleged that people have grown skeptical of government direction following the pandemic. 
“When they’re telling you, even if they’re right, I think some people are pushing back against it. It’s going to take time to rebuild trust there. And I think what the surgeon general’s position is, the way you build trust is to provide information and use persuasion rather than try to ostracize people from society if they make a different choice.”
The DeSantis administration last year proposed legislation (HB 1299) that would have required health care facilities and providers to treat patients regardless of whether they were vaccinated. 
Although the House agreed to the language, passing HB 1299 by a near-unanimous vote, state Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart whose late husband had been a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability. Jason Pizzo, a no-party affiliation senator from Hollywood, said requiring a physician to treat unvaccinated patients would run afoul of a 2023 law that allows physicians to withhold care based on conscience.
The provision was one of two related to vaccines included in the Department of Health (DOH) bill. The initial language would have indefinitely saved from repeal the statutory definition of  “messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine” (mRNA) and along with it a ban on businesses, government entities, and educational institutions from discriminating against people who refuse mRNA vaccines. 
The Legislature had agreed in 2021 to put the mRNA definition in statute along with the protections for people who wouldn’t take mRNA vaccines, essentially blocking any move in the state from requiring vaccine passports. But the 2021 law expired in four years, or June 2025. The DeSantis administration wanted to extend the mRNA definition and protections indefinitely.
But the Legislature refused to go along and agreed to keep the definition and subsequent ban in statutes only until June 2027.
DeSantis criticized the Legislature for not signing off on those provisions in HB 1299.
Regarding the mNRA definition, DeSantis said: “That’s got to be made permanent. I mean everyone is glad that we did that. Even the far left, I don’t hear them, at least publicly they won’t admit they’re for vaccine passports. It doesn’t make sense. So they need to do that.”
Regarding requiring physicians and facilities to treat unvaccinated patients the governor said:
 “I get on some levels if someone comes for medical care and  you’re just in private practice. I don’t know if you’re under any obligation to necessarily see everybody — I mean, you’d have to talk to doctors about that. I get there’s a business component to this. 
“But to say that a mom can’t get her daughter in to see a pediatrician because, while they did MMR (measles mumps and rubella) and all the standard vaccines, they didn’t do maybe Hep B or COVID or some of those. To me, that’s discrimination. I mean, that is limiting people’s freedom to do what they think is right for their kids by having these restrictions.”
Former state senator-turned Lt. Gov. Jay Collins sponsored the companion to HB 1299 in the Senate, SB 1270.

Gun pitch
DeSantis on Monday also made a pitch for open carry.
Florida is one of just a handful of states (and the only red state) that prohibits people from openly carrying firearms in public. 
DeSantis said that, with Republicans in supermajority control of both chambers of the Florida Legislature, it shouldn’t be a problem getting the bill passed.
“It’s not something that’s controversial,” he said. “The sky hasn’t fallen in any of those [states which have legalized open carry]. 
Although the governor called out the House for failing to pass such legislation, in fact it’s been Senate leaders who in recent years have said that they don’t support open carry.
Senate President Ben Albritton said last year that he’s supported law enforcement his entire life, and stood with them in opposing open carry. He cited opposition from the Florida Sheriffs Association
However Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey told Luis Valdes, Florida state director of Gun Owners of America, in January that he believes the majority of Florida sheriffs now do support legalizing open carry in Florida.
Collins also made the case for open carry during Monday’s press conference.
“We should be an open-carry state,” he said. “I think that we’re on record many times saying that. Hopefully, this is the year. We will continue to fight for those freedoms and those rights, each and every day until we get them all back.”
Collins never introduced legislation supporting open carry during his three terms as a state senator representing Hillsborough County. 
Second Amendment advocates have heard DeSantis make similar pleas for the Legislature on open carry in previous years to no success. One such group has called for a special legislative session to get lawmakers on the record about where they stand on this issue.
“Gun Owners of America is thankful for Gov. DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins supporting open carry,” Valdes said.
“But we feel that the rubber needs to meet the road, and that a special session needs to be called specifically for open carry and gun rights as a whole, so the Republican supermajority can lay bare where they truly stand on gun rights. If they vote down a special session, then gun owners going into 2026 know which lawmakers actually support and defend the Second Amendment.”
DeSantis again criticized a Florida law passed in 2018 that bans individuals under the age of 21 from purchasing a long gun. The Florida House has passed a measure repealing that law over the past three legislative sessions, but the Senate has never followed suit. 
DeSantis and Collins spoke at a sporting goods store in Plant City, where they kicked off the press conference by announcing what they are calling a “ Second Amendment tax free holiday” that takes place until the end of the year.
That means that all purchases of firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, crossbows, and accessories for bows and crossbows in Florida are tax free up until December 31. Camping and fishing supply purchases are also tax-free until the remainder of the year.

Jean Carroll case upheld by appeals court,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-penalty-83m-e-jean-carroll-case-upheld-appeals-court,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Monday upheld that President Donald Trump must pay an $83 million penalty for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019, rejecting Trump’s argument that presidential immunity shields him from the punishment.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in Manhattan reaffirmed a lower court decision denying Trump’s claim that the 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision granting presidential immunity protects him, and his assertion that the monetary punishment was excessive. The three-judge panel wrote that Trump never argued “absolute” presidential immunity as the defamation case proceeded in 2020, and “hence, he may not do so now.” At the time, he argued for temporary immunity until he was out of office.The decision was unsigned. The appeal was before Judges Denny Chin, who was appointed to the bench in 2010 by President Barack Obama; Sarah A. L. Merriam, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022; and Maria Araújo Kahn, appointed by Biden in 2023. Trump statementsThe case centered on Trump’s statements about Carroll after New York magazine published an excerpt of the writer’s new book in June 2019, in which she alleged Trump sexually assaulted her in a fitting room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in 1996. Trump repeatedly made public statements and social media posts claiming Carroll’s story was “totally fabricated” and that he didn’t know her, despite being previously photographed with her. Trump began to claim absolute presidential immunity in December 2022, years into the case, and a district court denied his request for a summary judgement, ruling that he had waived any claim to it by failing to raise it in previous court filings.Trump appealed to the 2nd Circuit and argued in a September 2024 brief that “presidential immunity is fatal to Carroll’s claims” and that Trump cannot be held liable for defamatory statements he made.The Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision in July 2024 that former U.S. presidents enjoy absolute criminal immunity for “core Constitutional” powers and are “entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts,” but are not immune from criminal prosecution for “unofficial acts.”Trump escalated the question of presidential immunity to the Supreme Court after being federally indicted on defrauding the American public by claiming falsely that he won the 2020 presidential election and allegedly conspiring to overturn the result.‘Extraordinary and unprecedented conduct’Trump had also argued the dollar amount the jury awarded to Carroll — $65 million of which was for punitive damages — was “grossly excessive.”The appeals court rejected that claim, highlighting that Trump continued to make defamatory remarks about Carroll during the yearslong litigation. “For nearly five years, Trump never wavered or relented in his public attacks on Carroll,” the judges wrote, even though he was found guilty in a separate but closely related civil case — a jury in 2023 found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the mid-1990s.“The statements all shared common themes: Trump continued to assert that Carroll was lying about the 1996 sexual assault and that she was motivated to do so for personal, financial, and political reasons, and to imply that Carroll was too unattractive to be sexually assaulted. He also began to claim that Carroll's lawsuit was part of a conspiracy to interfere with the 2024 election, and vowed to continue to make similar statements in the future.”The judges said Trump’s behavior amounted to ""extraordinary and unprecedented conduct.”",,,,2025-09-08 15:57:42.156659

Let’s Go Washington on Monday announced it will begin gathering signatures for two new initiatives to the state Legislature. One, focused on parental rights, comes after a heated debate on the topic during this year’s legislative session in Olympia. Another looks to block transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports.
The group, led by hedge fund manager Brian Heywood, will now need to collect 308,911 signatures by Jan. 2 to get the measures before lawmakers. Though sponsors are advised to submit at least 386,000 signatures to allow room for error if some are ruled invalid.
Last year, legislators approved Let’s Go Washington’s Initiative 2081, which set new requirements for the information schools had to provide to parents. This year, Democratic lawmakers pushed through an overhaul of this “parental bill of rights,” upsetting supporters of the original measure.
The new law, House Bill 1296, took effect immediately upon Gov. Bob Ferguson’s signature in May.
It remains a flashpoint in the debate over gender inclusivity and diversity, equity and inclusion in schools. 
Meanwhile, the state’s approach to parental and students’ rights, and related gender issues in schools, has attracted scrutiny from the Trump administration. In the spring, the U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation into Washington’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction over gender inclusion policy.
The new Let’s Go Washington initiative, IL26-001, would repeal the changes House Bill 1296 made to the group’s earlier initiative. 
A significant change made this year was removing parental access to student medical records. The law also codified certain student rights and added new parental rights, including for parents to be notified of unexcused absences. 
“We don’t co-parent with the government,” Heywood said in a statement. “No government employee can care about or love your child like you do.”
State Rep. Monica Stonier, a Democrat from Vancouver and the lead sponsor on House Bill 1296, said Heywood’s proposal isn’t surprising. 
“The Let’s Go Washington team is just not at all interested in talking about the facts around policy,” she said Monday. “They’re more interested in telling stories that can divide our communities.”
During legislative debate on House Bill 1296, the conservative group floated sending an initiative on parental rights directly to voters but abandoned the effort.
Let’s Go Washington’s second new initiative deals with another hot-button issue. IL26-638 would block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports. 
President Donald Trump has made this one of his top social issues. In March, the U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation into the Tumwater School District over allowing a transgender athlete from an opposing team to compete in a girls’ high school basketball game.
Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding to districts that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. Local school officials have said they’re in a bind: Either comply with state law and jeopardize federal funding, or follow Trump and risk punishment from the state.
If an initiative receives the required signatures, lawmakers have a few options. They can pass it as proposed, making it law. They can reject it, sending the measure to the ballot for voters to weigh in at the next general election, which would be November 2026. Or they could pass an alternative to the proposed initiative, which would put both the original and revised versions on the ballot.
As written, both initiatives would face a steep uphill battle to win approval from the Democrat-controlled Legislature, which reconvenes in January for a 60-day session.

Let’s Go Washington previously gathered enough signatures to send six initiatives to the Legislature in 2024. Lawmakers approved three, including Initiative 2081, and sent three others to voters, who turned them down. The group also supported Initiative 2066 focused on slowing the state’s shift away from natural gas, which voters passed but is now tied up in court.
As with that previous slate, Let’s Go Washington expects to spend millions of dollars on this campaign.

A GoFundMe account for Luis Juárez, the former Duke University bus driver who lost his protected immigration status and his job today, has nearly reached the $15,000 goal organizers set. As of midday Monday, contributions topped $11,200 from 375 donations.
Late Friday, the fund had raised more than $7,400 from 279 donations. The money will help Juárez with at least two months of living expenses, the organizers said, and also help him retain a lawyer.
Duke senior Michael Ramos announced the GoFundMe page Thursday during a press conference at the Legislative Building in Raleigh. Ramos and about 50 Duke students and other supporters traveled to Raleigh to ask U.S. Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) and state Republican leaders to use their influence with Trump to help Juarez retain his protected status.
“We’re not giving up on supporting Luis [Juárez],” Ramos said during the press conference. “Everyday Luis helps hundreds of us get to where we need to go, so we’re going to make sure Luis has what he needs to get to the next stop in his journey.”
Juárez, a Honduran who came to the U.S. more than 30 years ago and has worked at Duke since 2006, is at risk of deportation due to a Trump administration order ending Temporary Protected Status for more than 50,000 Hondurans.
The Trump administration contends that conditions in Honduras have improved enough that nationals living in the U.S. can now return home safely. Starting today,  Hondurans with temporary protected status are no longer protected from deportation and no longer have employment authorization. 
“Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement in July. “It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago. Honduran citizens can safely return home, and DHS is here to help facilitate their voluntary return.”
Juárez told media and supporters last week that he is concerned about his safety if forced to return. Others who traveled to the country recently told him that criminal organizations operating there still pose a risk.
U.S District Judge Edward Chen ruled last week that the Trump administration’s efforts to strip temporary protected status from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is illegal. Chen’s ruling allows around 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians to continue living and working legally in the U.S.
Juárez has become a popular figure on the Duke campus. He was profiled in the Duke Chronicle in February. And last month, 477 students, faculty and staff submitted letters of support for Juárez to Duke Visa Services, asking the university to take action on his behalf.
Juárez is well-known across Duke’s campus with students calling his the “party bus” because of the music he blasts. His many supporters say he has brought joy to their lives by playing lively music on his route.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4712-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 15:57:42.156659

Judge Damon Stevenson became the fifth circuit judge of one of the largest and busiest circuit courts in the state, bringing Hinds County up to the most number of circuit judges in Mississippi. 
At a Friday investiture ceremony, he said he wants his courtroom to be a place of redemption, justice and mercy, especially for troubled young people to help them become productive members of society. Sharing those goals urged him to talk about his late father, who had been sentenced in the Hinds courthouse, as an example of how people can change regardless of where they started in life.  
Stevenson also wants to play a role in making Hinds County a safe place, which is where he considers home and is raising a family. 
“I just want to do right by people. I just want to be fair. I just want a court that moves cases, that is responsible to the community,” the Clinton resident said. 
Gov. Tate Reeves appointed Stevenson, who began work Sept. 1. Stevenson’s term runs through Jan. 4, 2027, and elections will be held starting in November 2026. 
Lawmakers created the judgeship during the recent legislative session under House Bill 1544. It was part of state-manded judicial and legislative redistricting based on the most recent U.S. Census. Population can determine whether a district gains, loses or maintains judges or chancellors. 
At the ceremony, Senior Circuit Judge Winston Kidd, who taught Stevenson at Mississippi College School of Law, said his former student has developed into a capable courtroom attorney who has the temperament to be a trial judge. 
Kidd also said that a fifth judge will help the Seventh Circuit Court District handle more cases and improve case flow – a need he and other Hinds County judges have raised. 
On Friday, city and county government leaders, former colleagues and classmates said they look forward to working with Stevenson and said they believe he would do a good job. 
U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves administered the oath of office while Stevenson stood by his wife and two daughters. Other family members also attended the ceremony. 
Prior to the appointment, Stevenson served as a judge for the Byram Municipal Court since 2018. 
Stevenson was admitted to practice law in 2008 and worked in private practice taking criminal defense, personal and family law cases. He has litigated criminal and civil cases in state and federal court. 
His work includes serving as a special master for mental health commitments in Hinds County Chancery Court and as a federal probation officer who conducted pre-sentence investigations in U.S. District Court. He also worked for the Mississippi Youth Justice Project and the Southern Poverty Law Center.  
He is a Brandon native and graduated from Tougaloo College where he studied economics.

It was always on the wall in his aunt’s house, but he never knew who she was until he found a news article about her. Now, he gets to share her story.

The woman’s name is Sally Lee, a witness and survivor of the 1875 Clinton Massacre. Robinson, a 76-year-old retiree and Clinton native, is her great-great-great grandson.
On Sept. 4, 1875, a Republican political rally in Clinton turned into a tragedy when white disruptors fired into the crowd, killing multiple people. What followed was several days of racist violence that helped bring Reconstruction in Mississippi to a bloody, tragic end.
Last week scholars, political figures and descendants of victims and survivors came together to commemorate the massacre’s 150th anniversary.
DeeDee Baldwin, an engagement librarian and associate professor at Mississippi State University, organized the commemoration events. She learned about the Clinton Massacre while researching Black state legislators during the Reconstruction era. 
“It’s a pivotal event, not just in Mississippi history but in national history, and hardly anybody knows about it,” Baldwin said.
Commemorations took place last week. On Wednesday, Baldwin joined a panel of historians to discuss the massacre during a “History is Lunch” event at the Two Mississippi Museums. On Thursday morning, there was a brief reflection at the historical markers for the massacre, followed that evening by another panel at Mississippi College. Descendents of the massacre’s victims and survivors spoke at a memorial service at Mount Hood Missionary Baptist Church on Saturday.
The events were sponsored by Mount Hood Missionary Baptist Church, Mississippi College, Mississippi State University’s Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library and Together for Hope.
Sen. Hillman Frazier, a Democrat from Jackson, authored a Senate resolution to recognize the massacre’s anniversary. He spoke at the commemoration event on Thursday morning, emphasizing the importance of political participation. 
“They didn’t have more bullets than the opposition, but they had the vote,” Frazier said. “Make your vote count.”

At the markers on Thursday, Robinson carried around a copy of Lee’s picture in a clear sheet protector. On the back of the page was a copy of an article from 1961 that The Clarion Ledger published about her life. This article, which inspired him to start learning more about her and his family’s history, retells notable stories in Lee’s life, including how she and her son survived during the Clinton Massacre.
The bloodshed occurred during the Reconstruction era. Before the partisan political makeup of today, the Republican Party was majority-Black and controlled much of state politics. Black men in Mississippi, granted voting rights and the ability to hold office by the federal government post-Civil War, had been voting for years and many held elected offices.
These post-war realities did not sit well with white Southern Democrats, who sought to restore white supremacy by any means necessary. In 1875, they devised the Mississippi Plan, a strategy to use fraud and brutal violence to suppress the Black vote and reestablish Democratic control of Southern state governments.
The fateful day in Clinton began as a political rally and picnic held by Mississippi’s Republican Party ahead of the 1875 statewide elections. 
About 1,500 to 2,500 people were in attendance, most of them Black families. Eighteen of the approximately 75 white attendees were Democrats. They were part of the White Liners, what was essentially a paramilitary unit for the state Democratic Party.
In an effort to preserve peace, the Republicans allowed Democratic Senate candidate Amos R. Johnston to speak at the event. However, when Republican newspaper owner and Union veteran Captain H.T. Fisher spoke, according to news accounts of the day, he was heckled and tensions quickly turned into bloodshed.
Gunshots rang out in the crowd. Many white Democrats fell into formation and fired into the crowd. At the rally, three white people and four Black people were dead, and six white people and 20 Black people were wounded. Black women and children frantically ran for safety. 
One of them was Lee, who ran with her son in her arms. Spotting a hollow in a sycamore tree, she placed the baby there and hid until it was safe.
Clinton’s white mayor at the time had called for assistance from towns nearby based on a rumor that armed Black people would storm the town. By nightfall, several hundred White Liners entered the town. They spent the next day hunting, beating and killing Black residents. During this time, an estimated 50 Black people had been killed.

In 1876, a congressional report debunked the Democrats’ narrative that the massacre was an attack on white citizens by armed Black Mississippians. They found instead that white Mississippi Democrats plotted to disrupt Republican political activities and “to inaugurate an era of terror.”
By 1877, Reconstruction was over and the last federal troops left the South, allowing white Democrats to regain political power and establish the most stringent of laws to suppress and endanger Black Mississippians during the Jim Crow era.
Today, 150 years later, Baldwin hopes people who learn about the story realize “the importance of participating in democracy and protecting it.”
Frazier emphasized this point when speaking at the historical marker on Sept. 4. He also spoke out against anti-DEI legislation, saying it held up progress for women and Black people. This sentiment has become particularly pronounced in recent weeks. Last month a federal judge struck down an anti-DEI guidance from the U.S. Department of Education. Another federal judge blocked Mississippi’s anti-DEI law for the foreseeable future, concerned it would violate Mississippians’ constitutional rights.
Three years prior, the state enacted a ban on teaching critical race theory in schools and universities. Mississippi Today reported last week that the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University halted funding for student organizations amid uncertainty over the law.
“They want to sanitize history,” Frazier said at the Clinton Massacre markers. “But we have to make sure we tell history the way it was.”
Robinson, still holding on to that photo of Lee, expressed hope that people attending the commemorations learned that “there’s a good side and a bad side to human beings, and you have to choose which side that you’re going to be on.”

(Photo by Chris Fulton/Mountain Home Observer)The Arkansas Department of Human Services has reversed its promise to release findings from an internal investigation into how the agency failed to act on 29 child abuse complaints over 11 years, leaving prosecutors and the public without answers about systemic failures that allowed a teenager to allegedly endure years of severe abuse.
The case involves a 15-year-old boy who was discovered locked naked in a bathroom with a ratchet strap securing the door in November 2024.
Court documents show he had allegedly been forced to sleep on a pallet in the bathroom, was only allowed out to attend school, and could only eat on school days. School records indicate he attended just 112 days since January 2024.
According to charging documents filed against Daniel Wright, 41, and Jaclyn Barnett, 42, investigations revealed that 29 reports had been made to the state’s Child Abuse Hotline since 2013.

The complaints included allegations of maltreatment, inadequate supervision, failure to provide food and essential needs, extreme or repeated cruelty, and failure to protect.
All reports were closed as unsubstantiated without full investigation, despite some coming from mandated reporters such as teachers, healthcare workers, and law enforcement officers who are legally required to report suspected abuse.
Sources familiar with the case indicate the family would often move residences after complaints were made to the hotline, a pattern that may have helped them evade scrutiny.
“How did we allow a child to be harmed when there were reports made, some 29 reports that were made about an incident?” asked Baxter County Prosecutor David Ethredge in a recorded interview.
“What are we doing so this never happens again? What are the safeguards we put in place to make sure that when we see repeated incidents concerning a child, that we’re going to make sure we see those triggers, that we step in and ask some additional questions?”
Following the arrests in November, Ethredge met with then-DHS Secretary Kristi Putnam and the agency’s chief counsel earlier this year. According to Ethredge, DHS leadership acknowledged serious failures and promised transparency.
“We discussed the issues, and it was very clear that they understood there was a problem, and they wanted to look at how we addressed the problem and what had happened to lead us to that point,” Ethredge said.
“I felt very satisfied and confident that there was going to be a resolution, that there was going to be answers that I could share with the community.”

Putnam, who had taken over DHS in 2023 after the abuse reports were filed, initiated an investigation into how the complaints were handled by her predecessors.
The agency pledged to review each of the 29 reports and determine why decisions were made to close them as unsubstantiated.










“We have an obligation to children. If we find that the people who should be protecting them have not done their job, does it rise to the level of criminal culpability? I don’t know. Without that information, it’s hard for me to say yes it does or no it doesn’t.”


– Baxter County Prosecuting Attorney David Ethredge


Putnam’s departure in June 2024 came as a surprise to many in Arkansas’ child welfare community.
She had arrived from Kentucky with strong credentials, including service on the board of the American Public Human Services Association, where she advocated for advancing child welfare systems nationwide.
Her LinkedIn profile lists children, education and social services as her primary causes, with extensive experience in child welfare reform at both Kentucky and Arkansas human services departments.
She now lists herself as self-employed on LinkedIn, having returned to Kentucky shortly after initiating the Mountain Home investigation.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Putnam would be returning to Kentucky for family reasons. Janet Mann, who had served as deputy secretary overseeing child welfare and youth services during some of the period when complaints were filed, was promoted to lead the agency.
Initially, a DHS spokesperson assured that Putnam’s departure would not delay the promised report.
By late August, however, the agency had reversed course.
“We have completed our review of this case and have informed the prosecutor. However, we have also determined that details cannot be released publicly as initially intended due to the sensitive child maltreatment investigative information it concerned. Arkansas law requires this information to be confidential,” DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick wrote in an email.
The agency refused to provide even a redacted summary of its findings, stating only that issues were being “handled internally.”
Ethredge strongly disputed the timing of DHS’s communication, saying he only learned of the reversal after media inquiries prompted a call from the department’s chief attorney.
“I know that now, time has passed, and their position has changed, and I don’t have those answers, and I would like to be able to give to the people of this community about what did transpire,” Ethredge said.
“I don’t know what the shift was, why they made the shift.”
The prosecutor expressed frustration that the agency invoked confidentiality laws that existed when the report was initially promised.
“A summary of the findings with no names listed would certainly have helped,” Ethredge said.
The Mountain Home case highlights broader systemic issues within Arkansas’s child welfare system. Data shows that only about 55 percent of reports made to the Child Abuse Hotline between January and March of this year were approved for actual investigation.
A 1991 class action lawsuit against the governor and DHS director documented systemwide problems, including failure to investigate abuse reports, inexperienced caseworkers with excessive caseloads and inadequate training.
As recently as 2021, DHS itself characterized the Arkansas foster care system as being “in crisis.”
Ethredge indicated he has not abandoned efforts to obtain answers about the systematic failures and is prepared to pursue criminal charges if warranted.
“We have an obligation to children,” he said. “If we find that the people who should be protecting them have not done their job, does it rise to the level of criminal culpability? I don’t know. Without that information, it’s hard for me to say yes it does or no it doesn’t.”
The prosecutor emphasized he would pursue criminal charges against DHS workers if an investigation reveals they were criminally culpable in allowing the child to continue being abused.
“If they find something different, then we decide,” Ethredge said, noting that while the standard for criminal cases differs from civil liability, “I think the public deserves to know that.”
The prosecutor said that if necessary, “we will bring DHS officials up here, question them on the issues related to this case and generate a report of our own.”
He had previously stated that if the DHS investigation revealed potential criminal negligence, he would ask the Arkansas State Police to investigate. ASP’s Crimes Against Children Division operates the abuse hotline and investigates reports of abuse in conjunction with the human services department.
Ethredge confirmed he is moving forward with the case against Wright and Barnett regardless of whether DHS turns over its findings.
Attempts to obtain documents through the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act have been unsuccessful. The Observer specifically requested information surrounding the 29 calls, which were available through the court system at one point and already in the possession of other news outlets. The Observer also requested internal emails between DHS employees over any reports surrounding the case.
After initial denials, the Observer pushed back on the automatic rejections of its FOIA requests. DHS FOIA Officer Rebekah Brooks said she would check on the requests before closing the Observer FOIA request on the DHS’s FOIA system without further comment.

The only document DHS would release to the Mountain Home Observer was the agency’s own email response to KTLO refusing to provide information.
The Observer is considering legal action to compel release of the documents.
Wright and Barnett each face 112 counts of first-degree false imprisonment, endangering the welfare of a minor and permitting child abuse.
Both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in November. They remain free on $50,000 bond each.

Monty Fritts of Kingston announced on Sept. 5 he is running for the 2026 Republican gubernatorial nomination. (Photo: Fritts4tn.com)Taking a shot at the political “establishment” in Tennessee’s Capitol, state Rep. Monty Fritts announced he is entering the governor’s 2026 race to cut spending and end government “overreach.”
Fritts is basing his candidacy on a move toward greater “liberty and less government” after recently criticizing the state attorney general’s appeal of a court ruling that would overturn the state’s “intent to go armed” law and guns-in-parks prohibition.
“While the Nashville establishment, the celebrity political body, seeks to take more of your money and redistribute it as corporate welfare or in socialist-leaning programs, I think Tennesseans are better off keeping more of their money and making their own decisions, their own medical decisions, health-care decisions, parenting decisions,” the Kingston Republican said in a video unveiling his candidacy.
Fritts, an Army veteran who retired from the nuclear industry, enters the Republican primary race as an underdog to U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Franklin and U.S. Rep. John Rose of Cookeville, both of whom have more name recognition and financial pull. Fritts acknowledged in his video he doesn’t have the $25 million it could take to win the governor’s race and said the “prideful and arrogant class” in Tennessee’s capital city will try to “destroy” his movement and push for more regulations and taxes to fund “corporate welfare” and social programs. 
“We face an embedded political class, Nashville establishment, celebrity class that says people like me, people like us, my neighbors, we shouldn’t run for offices like this because we’re not well connected enough in D.C., Hollywood or Nashville,” he said in the video.
Fritts said his plan is to curb the growth of Tennessee’s budget, which he said has increased 59% in the last six years, “recalibrate” state government to make sure commissioners and lawmakers work within bounds of the Constitution, not for special interest groups and powerful lobbies; and suspend “power-grab schemes” that enable bureaucrats to make decisions.
In addition to trimming the budget, Fritts said he would eliminate the state’s 4% sales tax on groceries.
Fritts voted against the governor’s private-school voucher bill when it narrowly passed the House this year and said on his campaign website he would suspend the program that provides funds for private-school enrollment and end “fiscally irresponsible, unconstitutional voucher programs.”
He also said the state should challenge Plyler v. Doe, a court ruling that requires schools to accept students even if they don’t have permanent citizenship status.
“Chemtrail” bill set for House circuit described as “nonsense”

Fritts’ website says he would protect life beginning at conception. He voted against a measure this year that guarantees women the right to in vitro fertilization and contraception.
The second-term lawmaker gained a bit of notoriety in 2024 when he passed legislation designed to stop the potential release of climate-controlling chemicals into Tennessee’s atmosphere. Fritts said at the time the measure dealt only with “geoengineering,” the release or injection of chemicals to affect the weather, purportedly to be done by the federal government and noted he wasn’t concerned about a connection to “chemtrail” conspiracy theories.
Fritts said last week he sent letters to Gov. Bill Lee and Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti that challenged their decision to appeal a Chancery Court ruling that found the state’s “intent to go armed” law and prohibitions on guns in parks were illegal. He gained support from several Republican lawmakers who signed the letters.
Fritts reported a balance of $11,050 in his state House campaign account with a $15,000 self-endorsed loan. Having just announced his gubernatorial candidacy, he has filed with the Registry of Election Finance but hasn’t turned in any financial reports.

(Pool photo by Jeffrey D. Allred/Deseret News)The Utah Supreme Court has granted Utah lawmakers’ emergency request for an expedited review as they petition to block a district court judge’s ruling that tossed out the Utah Legislature’s 2021 congressional map. 
In an order issued Saturday, Utah’s highest court gave the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and several Salt Lake County voters — until Tuesday to file a response to lawmakers’ appeal. Legislative attorneys will then have until Thursday to file a response. 
Utah redistricting lawsuit parties agree on new timeline to redraw congressional map

The Utah Supreme Court’s order came just a day after legislative attorneys filed their petition on Friday, while also asking the court to grant or deny their motion no later than Sept. 15 given the tight timeline the Utah Legislature now faces to draw a new map by Sept. 25 in time for the 2026 elections. 
“Because the district court refused to stay its permanent injunction (on the 2021 congressional map), the Legislature must take steps right now to plan and conduct a special session in time to publish an alternative map by September 25 using a process that does not fully comply with Proposition 4,” legislative attorneys wrote in their request for expedited consideration. 
They argued the time constraints “only heighten the separation-of-powers harms to the Legislature” inflicted by 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s order and it “disregards what the district court has determined is the proper will of the people.” 
Gibson last week ruled the 2021 map was the product of an unconstitutional process after the Utah Legislature repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that created an independent redistricting commission. By passing SB200, the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature turned that commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore — which is what they did when they drew the 2021 congressional map that anti-gerrymandering groups have called “blatant gerrymandering.”

Attorneys for the Legislature are asking the Utah Supreme Court to overturn — or at least temporarily block — Gibson’s Aug. 25 ruling tossing out the state’s 2021 congressional boundaries and ordering the Utah Legislature to draw a new map. 
Legislative attorneys are appealing to the same court that handed them a major blow last summer, when all five justices on the Utah Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion that Gibson — who had previously dismissed the claim that the Legislature violated the constitution when it repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative — had erred. That ruling also made clear that the Utah Legislature did not have unfettered power to repeal and replace all types of voter initiatives, but rather must show a “compelling government interest” in order to change “government reform” initiatives. 
In their appeal to the Utah Supreme Court on Friday, lawmakers’ attorneys argued the process Gibson has laid out to draw the new congressional map only follows parts of Proposition 4 — not all of it — and should therefore be overturned. 
“The people of Utah can have new congressional maps in place for the 2026 congressional elections. Or they can have new congressional maps resulting from a process that follows all of Proposition 4, which the district court has concluded now governs redistricting in
Utah,” legislative attorneys wrote in their petition. “But given the election calendar, Utahns cannot have both.”
The lieutenant governor’s office has said the latest possible date for the court to choose a new congressional map — whether it’s one drawn by the Utah Legislature or one proposed by lawsuit’s plaintiffs — is Nov. 10, so counties will have enough time to finalize their precincts before candidates can begin filing in January. 
Utah state attorneys ask judge to pause order tossing out congressional map while they appeal

Drawing new maps in complete accordance with Proposition 4 — which outlines an extensive public process — “will take longer than that,” legislative attorneys wrote. 
“Thus forced to choose, Plaintiffs sacrificed Proposition 4’s means for their preferred ends. To them, having new maps for the 2026 congressional elections matters more than complying with all of Proposition 4. The district court agreed and effectively excised the Independent Redistricting Commission process,” legislative attorneys wrote. 
They argued that “improper exercise of equitable power evinces a mismatch between the district court’s merits conclusion and its remedy — and suggests that claims Plaintiffs have repeated about Proposition 4 since this lawsuit started constitute little more than window dressing.” 
“But eschewing complete compliance, the district court’s remedial order takes a cafeteria
approach to the redistricting law it has just reinstated in full, picking and choosing what sections really matter,” they wrote. “The remedial order avoids some parts of Proposition 4 as statutory empty calories: the commission is not necessary, the Legislature need not take an up-or-down vote on the commission’s recommendations, and the Legislature doesn’t need to explain why its map is better than the commission’s recommendations.”
It’s a similar argument legislative attorney Tyler Green made during a hearing Aug. 29, when he had urged the judge to pause her ruling that tossed out the 2021 map. Last week, Gibson denied that request, saying delaying the order would “sanction the wholesale repeal of Proposition 4 and would irreparably harm the people of Utah.”
Judge denies Utah lawmakers’ request to pause order tossing out congressional map

Mark Gaber, an attorney with Campaign Legal Center that’s representing the plaintiffs, argued that had the Utah Legislature not unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Proposition 4 in the first place, the matter wouldn’t have landed in court. He also argued that Utah is not unique, and that other states have faced court-imposed deadlines because they’ve failed to properly adopt maps under their own redistricting processes. 
“This is something that happens when a map violates the law,” Gaber said. 
Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process comes during a time when fights over mid-decade redistricting are on the national stage, fueled by President Donald Trump’s aim to bolster the U.S. House’s slim Republican majority in the 2026 midterms. 
In her order last week, Gibson said Utah “has an opportunity to be different” in its redistricting process. 
 “While other states are currently redrawing their congressional plans to intentionally render some citizen votes meaningless,” she wrote. “Utah could redesign its congressional plan with an intention to protect its citizens’ right to vote and to ensure that each citizen’s vote is meaningful.”

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier wants a former state senator investigated over a Facebook post in which she revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were massed at an Orlando bus station.
In an X post Monday, Uthmeier said former Sen. Linda Stewart, an Orlando Democrat, may have been “harassing law enforcement” by telling Floridians on Aug. 15 that ICE was at the Lynx Central Station in downtown Orlando.
In an interesting twist, just hours after hinting at a suspension from her post, Uthmeier asked Orange County’s Democratic state attorney, Monique Worrell, to do the investigating.
Stewart, 76, protested.
“I have done absolutely nothing wrong!” Stewart told The Florida Phoenix on a phone call, alleging that Uthmeier had not reached out to her before posting on social media. “I’m shocked. I don’t know why [Uthmeier] would do such a thing for me saying that ICE is in a public space. I didn’t go into ICE headquarters and find out all the details of where they’re going to be. … I just posted [on Facebook].”
“Big deal,” she continued, insisting that she’s not worried. “In all of their freedom of speech, I don’t know what reason they would think that that could cause me to be arrested.”

Stewart said that a friend had told her that ICE was at the station, informing her Aug. 15 Facebook post. Soon after, MAGA podcaster and right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who boasts nearly 2 million followers on X, alerted Uthmeier on social media that Stewart was allegedly “doxxing” ICE.
Doxxing involves maliciously publicizing a person’s personal information. In June, Uthmeier rolled out a new program specifically designed to protect ICE agents from being doxxed.
“Harassing law enforcement to prevent them from doing their jobs is unlawful in Florida,” Uthmeier said, calling on Orange County State Attorney Worrell to investigate. “Stop playing politics with the lives and safety of law enforcement officers.”
But in an emailed statement to The Florida Phoenix, Worrell’s office said investigations are typically conducted by law enforcement, not by her staff.
“Traditionally, our office does not conduct investigations. That function lies with law enforcement. To date, we have not received a criminal case package from law enforcement,” said Anika Hamilton, Worrell’s communications specialist. “Should one be submitted, we will review it and handle the matter in the same way we handle all other criminal cases presented to us.”
Uthmeier’s call to action came just hours after he sent a lengthy letter to Worrell, demanding she stop pressing charges against a woman accused of second-degree murder. Uthmeier, who believes the woman acted in self-defense, claimed Worrell’s prosecution could constitute an ethical violation demonstrating ground for a suspension from office.
It wouldn’t be the first time Worrell’s been suspended. In 2023, when Uthmeier served as chief of staff to Gov. Ron DeSantis, the governor removed Worrell from office for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.” Last November she won re-election to the post, defeating the DeSantis appointee who replaced her by 15 points.
“There’s just no reason for it,” Stewart said. “I can’t imagine [Worrell] saying I did anything wrong. I just don’t get it.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows responded on Monday to a second request from the federal government for more sensitive voter information, again rebuffing the request and reiterating her concerns about the Trump administration’s intentions.
In a letter dated Aug. 18, the U.S. Department of Justice again requested Maine’s full voter registration list — including all fields, such as driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers and full dates of birth. 
But this letter, which came from Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights at the DOJ, also added a request for voter registration applications from a 19-month period, from December 1, 2023 to July 1, 2025.
“The Department of Justice hasn’t shown any good reason for its fishing expedition for sensitive voter information on every American,” Bellows said in a statement Monday. “The federal government has a terrible track record keeping private data safe. Their data demands appear to violate federal privacy laws and complying would put the privacy and data security of nearly one million Mainers at risk.”
Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

The civil rights division of the DOJ sent its first sweeping request for voter data on July 24, which, in addition to the statewide voter registration list, asked for names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and other information from November 2022 through the receipt of the letter. Earlier, on July 10, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys sent an email requesting a phone call with Bellows to discuss a “potential information-sharing agreement.”
Bellows officially declined the DOJ request for voter data on Aug. 8, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. 
In its response, the DOJ wrote that the purpose of its request for personal voter information is to assess the state’s compliance with the statewide voter registration list maintenance provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. Bellows dismissed that reasoning in her letter sent Monday, noting that the First Circuit Court of Appeals has expressly recognized that the act does not require disclosure of such information.
Bellows also raised concern about how the DOJ’s request complies with federal privacy laws, such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the e-Government Act of 2004, given that the department hasn’t shared how voters’ personal information will be stored, accessed and retained within government systems.
“It is my understanding that DOJ intends to feed Maine’s voter file into some sort of
unidentified information technology system in an attempt to identify duplicate and other invalid
registrations,” Bellows wrote, referring to the Trump administration’s repurposing of an existing federal immigration database, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, into a platform to verify voters’ citizenship. 
Bellows spoke with Maine Morning Star and its partner outlet Stateline about SAVE earlier this summer. She said she had a phone call with officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who said the agency planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows told Stateline. 
While Maine, like several other states, has declined the DOJ’s demands for sensitive voter data, Bellows shared state policies and practices in her Aug. 8 response. 
If the DOJ provides additional information addressing her concerns about intended use and privacy outlined in her Monday letter, Bellows wrote she would “carefully consider that information.” But, she wrote, “At this time, however, I am unable to comply with the DOJ’s requests for unredacted information concerning all Maine voters.”

Ever since the world was overtaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, public health policy and vaccine policy have been front and center in the national political debate. And tragically, despite a longstanding and overwhelming consensus among public health experts across the globe about the efficacy of vaccines and their vital importance in protecting human health and wellbeing, a small group of naysayers and conspiracy theorists have managed to hijack the debate and, in some instances, ascend to positions of power and influence.
And right now, this phenomenon is in full bloom in the United States as the Trump administration, under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is moving aggressively to roll back decades of progress in combating disease by discouraging vaccines and slashing funding for research. Fortunately, an array of gifted and well-informed experts continues to speak the truth on these important subjects, and recently we caught up with one of them, UNC Professor of Medicine and infectious disease expert, Dr. David Wohl.

In Part Two of our chat, we continued our discussion of some of the current policy debates, as well as Wohl’s deep concerns about the ongoing federal government disinvestments in health research.

Under the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law, they believe that allows them to cancel the funding even if Congress refuses to go along with the proposal. The move is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and evoked ire from senior lawmakers, including Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine.“Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse,” Collins wrote in a statement. “Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”Administration sees executive branch ‘at war with itself’The appeal to the Supreme Court filed Monday urges the justices to let the legislative and executive branches figure out the spending dispute on their own and criticizes a federal district court for ordering the Trump administration to spend the money. “The injunction requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself,” wrote Solicitor General D. John Sauer. “Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients.”The pocket rescissions request at the center of this case is separate from the one Trump sent Congress in early June that asked members to eliminate funding for numerous foreign aid accounts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Lawmakers approved that proposal in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.Congress has yet to act on the second rescissions request as its leaders look for ways to fund the government ahead of an Oct. 1 shutdown deadline. Attorneys for the organizations that brought the lawsuit — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Global Health Council — wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court submitted Monday that they opposed the Trump administration's request to overturn the lower court’s preliminary injunction. “USAID and the State Department have been under a duty to obligate these funds since at least March 2024, when Congress enacted the appropriations; they chose not to act sooner,” they wrote. “The government faces no cognizable harm from having to take steps to comply with the law for the short period while this Court considers its stay application.”",,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

Article Summary

President Donald Trump’s administration sought to block $11 billion in public health funding grants in a March executive order.
Illinois was among nearly a dozen Democrat-led states to file suit against the action.
Those states won an injunction against the administration’s action in May, which allowed them to keep much of the funding that was slated for cuts.
The injunction applied to only states that sued.
Illinois has been able to retain 19 of the 21 grants that were slated for termination.

This summary was written by the editors of Capitol News Illinois.

After the Trump administration slashed billions in state and local public health funding from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this year, the eventual impact on states split sharply along political lines.
Democratic-led states that sued to block the cuts – including Illinois – kept much of their funding, while Republican-led states lost the bulk of theirs, according to a new analysis from health research organization KFF.
The uneven fallout underscores how politics continues shaping health care in the United States. The nearly 700 CDC grants were worth about $11 billion and had been allocated by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Not just COVID-19 spending
Since then, state and local health departments had spent or planned to spend the money not just on COVID-related efforts, but also on prevention of other infectious diseases, support for mental health and substance use, shoring up aging public health infrastructure, and other needs.
The CDC grant terminations initially affected red and blue states about evenly, according to KFF. California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts — all led by Democrats — had among the largest numbers of terminated grants.




The Illinois Department of Public Health announced on March 26 that the federal government was pulling back over $400 million in grant funding that previously had been approved. That included $125 million that was earmarked to support laboratory operations in 97 local health departments as well as $324 million for future work to prevent and treat infectious diseases in Illinois.
Blue states sue
Illinois was one of nearly two dozen blue states and the District of Columbia that sued the Trump administration in April, asking the court to block the grant terminations. They argued the federal government lacked the authority to rescind funding it had already allocated.
The suit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, argued that Congress appropriated those funds in various pandemic-related spending bills, and the administration’s decisions to terminate the grants violated the federal Administrative Procedures Act.
“Illinois and states across the nation rely on federal grants to provide state public health services that protect our children and residents from serious diseases or health crises,” Raoul said in a statement at the time. “The abrupt termination of this funding that impacts millions of American lives is both callous and unlawful.”

A federal judge sided with the blue states and blocked the cancellations  — but she limited her injunction to the jurisdictions that filed in the lawsuit. Nearly 80% of the grant cuts have now been restored in blue states, according to the KFF analysis, compared with less than 5% in red states.
According to the KFF analysis, 21 grants in Illinois were targeted for termination prior to the lawsuit, but just two have been terminated following the judge’s injunction.




Cuts hit red states hardest
Now four of the five states with the most canceled grants are led by Republicans: Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. California, which is dominated by Democrats, kept all of its grants that had been initially terminated.
In the West and Midwest, Democratic-led Colorado — which joined the lawsuit — had 10 of its 11 grant terminations reversed. Its Republican-led neighbors that did not sue, including Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, lost all of their grants, according to the KFF analysis.

Bob Quinn stepped down as CEO of the South Carolina Research Authority in August. He continues to work for the organization in an advising role through next June.
The authority’s governing board has yet to name a new leader in the interim, according to spokeswoman Adrianne Grimes.
The legislature formed the authority, which acts like something of an angel investor to promising technology startups and university research projects in the state, in 1983. Legislators gave the organization $500,000 in state money and 1,400 acres of undeveloped land to get started.
Quinn has been at the helm of the organization since August 2016, a role in which he earned more than $326,000 annually according to the government non-profit’s latest tax filings. Quinn continues to receive the same salary in his advisory role, Grimes said.
The authority boosts technological developments and research in the state through grants and entrepreneurial coaching. It also introduces entrepreneurs and researchers to larger companies in the state in need of technical innovations, helping startups and college academics secure industry contracts.
The authority raised nearly $17 million in the 2024 budget year, mostly from private donations and revenue it earns from leasing space in its six incubators across the state. That revenue is then used to fund the organization’s grants and operations.
The organization, under Quinn’s leadership, gave out $5.2 million in grants to startup companies between July 2023 through the end of June 2024, according to the latest annual report. In turn, those companies fundraised an addition $303 million.
Over the past decade, the authority has given out just shy of $30 million in grants to college researchers.
More than 200 companies and 86 researchers are actively involved with the organization.
In an Aug. 15 letter to the board, Quinn said he planned to retire as CEO effective June 30, 2026. It is unclear why the executive board — made up of five of South Carolina’s public college presidents, two legislators, a chairman appointed by the governor and two other board chosen members — chose to transition Quinn to an advisory role in the meantime.
Quinn declined to comment when contacted by the SC Daily Gazette.
In the letter to the board, Quinn cited his wife’s retirement at the end of last year and said he had long been planning his own retirement for the end of the 2026 budget year.
“It is the honor of my professional lifetime to serve in this role,” Quinn wrote. “I am constantly inspired by our deeply dedicated employees and their strong commitment to fulfill our mission to fuel South Carolina’s innovation economy.

(Courtesy of Patricia Zenone/USFWS)Conservation groups want a Texas court to overturn the recent gutting of federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken, a near-flightless bird living in the grasslands of Eastern New Mexico and four other states. 
In 2022, the Biden Administration offered the bird protection under the Endangered Species Act. Federal officials, through a public process, designated the smaller southern population in New Mexico and the Texas panhandle as “endangered,” and the northern population across Kansas, Oklahoma, northern Texas and Eastern Colorado as “threatened.”
In August, a Texas judge stripped federal protections for the chicken. Precipitating the August decision was the Trump Administration’s seismic about-face in May, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said there was a “fundamental error” in the Biden Administration’s listing of the bird in 2022. The memo requested the judge side with opponents suing against the protections, which included the states of Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, along with representatives from the ranching and petroleum industries. 
Conservationists: Ending lesser prairie chicken protections could set a troubling precedent

The Arizona-based nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity filed the appeal in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Monday, asking a panel of judges to overturn the decision and allow conservation groups to enter the proceedings — arguments denied by the lower courts.
“The Trump Administration had no legal or scientific basis for its reversal,” Jason Rylander, the legal director for the group’s Climate Law Institute, told Source NM.
The chicken — known for its quirky courtship dances involving inflated cheek pouches and stomping — has been in and out of court for the past three decades as its numbers declined from the millions into about 26,000 (as of 2022) across the grasslands of New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. 
Rylen said arguments could be presented by this fall, but that the population lost all federal protections, including ones that prohibited hunting or killing the chickens. While more chickens survive in the Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas portion of its range, the species faces habitat losses from industry and climate change, threatening its long-term survival — especially in New Mexico. 
“The southern population of the lesser prairie chicken is now at severe risk of blinking out entirely,” he said. 
Rylander said the bigger picture is the upheaval of environmental protections by the federal government. 
“The Trump administration has taken an anti-science, scorched-earth approach to environmental conservation and public land protections, stripping Clean Air Act protections, denying climate change, and declaring endangered species persona non grata,” Rylander said. “I think that’s just a horrifying prospect for conservation in America.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/RSlesser-prairie-chicken-Patricia-Zenone-usfws-dg1.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc. will abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots with a move to the Boston Seaport by the end of 2026, the company announced Monday.
The announcement cements the fate Rhode Island officials and business leaders have spent the last year trying to avoid by offering the iconic toymaker prime Providence real estate in the hopes of keeping its 1,000-person local workforce in Rhode Island. But the pull of Massachusetts, including state tax incentives, access to robust public transportation and partnerships with nearby academic institutions and businesses proved too strong.
“Boston’s thriving business community, deep academic partnerships and cultural vibrancy, together with our Seattle team’s leadership in technology, creativity, and innovation, give Hasbro an unparalleled foundation for growth,” Chris Cocks, Hasbro CEO, said in a statement. “Together, these offices will fuel the next chapter of Hasbro.”
The toy and gaming empire said it plans to move to a 16-story laboratory building in the Boston Seaport, by the end of 2026. The lease for a 265,000 square feet spanning seven floors at 400 Summer St. in Boston will replace its present headquarters, a circa-1900 manufacturing building on Newport Avenue in Pawtucket. Cocks has already signaled his discontent with the Pawtucket space, saying it was “showing its age” in an internal email dating back to Sept. 16, first reported by the Boston Business Journal. Publicly released emails show Massachusetts state officials began courting Hasbro as early as April 2024, offering various tax incentives in the hopes of luring the company.
Rhode Island leaders scrambled to put together a counteroffer, which included the opportunity for Hasbro to buy a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1. But more sweeping tax incentives, similar to those pitched by Massachusetts officials, were never put on the table for the Rhode Island General Assembly to consider during its 2025 legislative session.
Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien and city officials reportedly came up with their own proposal to keep Hasbro within the city, though details were never shared publicly. 
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who met with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey on Sept. 4, also did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.
At the start of the year, Hasbro’s projected profit losses from President Donald Trump’s tariffs appeared to keep a potential move at bay, with the company postponing its initial deadline for a decision. Second quarter earnings released on July 23 suggested the financial consequences of tariffs might not be as severe as initially feared, though Cocks did not address the potential relocation.
Healey touted Hasbro’s decision in a win for “Team Massachusetts” in a statement on Monday.
“We are thrilled that Hasbro has chosen Massachusetts as the home of its new headquarters, and we’re ready to support the hundreds of jobs they will create here,” Healey said. “We’re proud to welcome this iconic company to Team Massachusetts — where we are number one for education, health care and innovation. I’m grateful for the leadership of Chris Cocks and his team at Hasbro, and for the hard work of my economic development team that helped make this possible.”
Andrea Snyder, a spokesperson for Hasbro, declined to answer questions regarding details of the decision, including specific incentives Massachusetts has offered, and when the decision was made. Snyder instead referred back to the company’s press release on the news. 
The Boston Seaport office will house Hasbro’s corporate services, as well as its toy, board game and licensing arms. Its digital gaming business, which includes MAGIC: The Gathering, will remain at its present hub in Renton, Washington, which features 111,000 square feet and 500 employees.

Josh’s path—from rural Vermont to global relief work—was shaped by creativity, service, and the support of those who believed in him. Today, he leads WYKR and a local newspaper, driven by a belief in community, curiosity, and the power of being seen for one’s full potential.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  From rural roots to global impact: A Vermont medi[...]","Joshua Smith of Yankee Kingdom Media and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, at a remote broadcast with WYKR. 
Over the past decade, the way people connect and build community has shifted in meaningful ways. 
As Joshua Smith watched these changes unfold, he noticed something important: while online platforms offered new opportunities, many people around him still craved real, local connection. Around the same time, the owner of WYKR, his hometown radio station, kept joking, “Josh, if you ever want to buy a radio station, let me know.” In 2023, Josh took him up on it.
Based in Wells River and serving parts of northern Vermont and New Hampshire, WYKR is the oldest country radio station in Vermont. True to its roots, Josh is revitalizing what radio was back in the ’70s and ’80s, featuring outdoor shows and programs, broadcasting the local basketball games, and keeping advertising affordable.
Josh is building something enduring. He took over The Bridge Weekly Showcase, a local paper, soon after buying WYKR. He formed Yankee Kingdom Media to sustain and grow both outlets. Local ownership, he notes, ensures the voices and stories of his community are heard. And it enhances the symbiotic relationship between local businesses. “Keeping local media local and independent? We can’t take it for granted,” he says. 
“I don’t know where I would have ended up.”
When Josh reflects on where he started—a disengaged student from rural Vermont—he’s clear about one thing: “I wouldn’t be here without VSAC believing in me.”
A self-professed theater kid at Blue Mountain Union High School, Josh wasn’t sure about college. His three brothers didn’t go, and although his parents wanted him to continue his education, he knew they couldn’t pay for it. Then, junior year, he began meeting monthly with a VSAC outreach counselor from VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program.
“My outreach counselor guided me through the entire process and took away any barriers I perceived. She also helped me remove the barriers of funding. She reinforced the fact that education is a right, not a privilege.”
Josh’s VSAC counselor helped him with his applications and financial aid paperwork, and coached him on what to expect in college. “VSAC looked at me and saw the full future version of me. Not my test scores, not my grades. Me,” he says.
Josh’s theater teacher had friends who taught at Webster University in Saint Louis, and they encouraged him to apply. So he did, along with a slate of other schools, all of which he was accepted to. Webster remained his first choice—and he ended up with a financial aid package that made it possible for him to go. 
From art school to international service
Josh originally dreamed of becoming a children’s book illustrator. Over the course of his college years, however, his perspective began to shift. He joined the Peace Corps after college, which changed everything, and high school French classes landed him a position in Niger. 
After being in Niger for two years, Josh renewed his option to stay for another two years. “I lived in a mud hut and pulled my own water from a well. And while there, I read all the books I was supposed to read in high school.” 
Josh’s Peace Corps experience ignited a passion for international service. He went on to earn a master’s in International Education from the School for International Training in Brattleboro and spent the next 12 years working with global humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and Action Against Hunger. From Pakistan to the Philippines, Libya to Nigeria, Joshua managed the complex logistics of getting food and medical supplies to those in crisis.
“I repaired ambulances in Libya during the revolution and had a machine gun pointed in my face. Along with survival, the logistical challenges of getting food and medical supplies to places during a crisis were mine to solve.”
But even while doing this high-stakes work, he never forgot his roots—or the people who helped get him started. “The key to success is showing up and believing in yourself,” he said. “My self-confidence really came from working with VSAC. They made me feel comfortable with being uncomfortable. When you’re a teenager, there is no self-confidence. When you have someone who believes in your potential more than you do, especially when it’s an adult—that’s powerful.”
“I don’t believe in one career for the rest of your life. I’m on my third.”
After marrying his wife, Edith (whom he met while working in Niger), and moving back to Vermont, Joshua earned an MBA from Norwich University and dove into the nonprofit world. He led an organization supporting people with intellectual disabilities and sat on several local boards before the opportunity to purchase WYKR came about. 
Now 49, at the helm of Yankee Kingdom Media and living in Morrisville with his wife and three children, one of Josh’s greatest joys is hosting a podcast—Vermont Authors and Artists—bringing together his lifelong love of creativity, service, and conversation.
Through it all, he carries forward his commitment to continuous curiosity—something he learned in theater and through the arts and is now passing on to his children.
“I don’t believe in one career for the rest of your life,” he notes. “I’m on my third. Ten years ago, I wouldn’t have seen this career coming.”

A new effort will enable drivers to learn if they are available spaces before they get to a location. (Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Truck drivers traveling through Washington are getting new technological tools to help find open parking spots in rest areas and weigh stations on Interstate 5.
A new program starting this month will offer drivers different ways to learn if there’s any place to park in a location a few miles or a few hours before they reach it. The Truck Parking Information Management System will provide this data via a website, a mobile application or an in-cab system.
State transportation officials said providing real-time information should help reduce guesswork and assist truck drivers in planning their travel.
This is a big deal. Truckers face legal limits on how many hours they can drive in a day and are electronically monitored to ensure they comply. They often start searching for parking long before needing it. 
Washington has roughly 530 truck parking spaces at its safety rest areas. But demand often exceeds supply.  Seventy-five percent of Washington’s truck drivers report problems finding safe parking at least once every week, according to the state Department of Transportation. Solving the shortage has been a focus of conversations and study in recent years.
By the end of September, data collection technology will be operational at 11 weigh stations and rest areas between Blaine and Vancouver. The $2.3 million spent to install it came from the federal Freight Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Six more locations will come online in 2026 using funds from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program. Both are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Drivers will be able to learn what’s available 20 miles before reaching any of those 11 locations, and again at five miles before arriving.
In addition, a feature in the free mobile app will project the expected number of available truck parking spaces at a designated location up to four hours in advance. The state Department of Transportation enlisted the University of Washington Star Lab to create this first-of-its-kind source of predictive information. 
Two vendors, Drivewyze and ParkerTruck, are providing the date for drivers through in-cab displays in their trucks or mobile apps on their phones.
Expanding truck parking capacity is an ongoing topic among lawmakers and transportation officials. A 2024 report assessed the challenges and recommended a series of actions for the Legislature to consider taking in the next six years.
In 2023, the department released a strategy for modernizing the state’s rest areas. Creating truck-only rest areas was suggested as one way to ease the shortage of spots.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/0-9-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Voters whose names or birth dates don’t match ID numbers in the state registration file won’t automatically have to use provisional ballots after all, under revised instructions the state Board of Elections approved Monday. 
The latest revisions to efforts to collect and validate government IDs come after Democrats on the state Board objected at its last meeting to the requirement that voters whose names or birth dates did not match identifiers in government databases would need to continually use provisional ballots until the mismatches were resolved. 
The state Board of Elections is trying to collect driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers from voters who don’t have either of those identifiers connected to their names in the state voter registration database. 
In some cases, voters may not have supplied the numbers. In other cases, misspelled names, transposed numbers in dates of birth, or changed names created data mismatches. 
For example, if a woman registers before she’s married and again after she’s married with a different last name, her Social Security number won’t match to the new registration. 
Letters have gone out to voters who apparently did not supply one of the required numbers, asking them for the information. If they haven’t supplied it by the next time they vote, they’ll be asked to fill out a provisional ballot. The provisional voting application asks for one of those numbers. 
People who supplied numbers that couldn’t be validated will vote regular ballots if they show an acceptable ID. 
Under the plan, county election boards will review records for data errors. Beginning in January, letters will go out twice a year to voters whose ID numbers won’t validate, asking them for help figuring out why. 
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state Board over the missing numbers. The state and the DOJ reached a settlement that District Judge Richard Myers II signed Monday. 
As the Board unanimously approved the new instructions, members engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about whether enough was being done to cull  noncitizen voters. 
Board member Robert Rucho, a former Republican state senator, questioned whether someone should be allowed to vote using a utility bill. 
The federal Help America Vote Act lists utility bills among the documents voters or new registrants can use to establish identity and residency. North Carolina law requires voters show a photo ID or fill out a form explaining why they don’t have one. 
“I just don’t think that we’re doing what our responsibility requires us to do,” Rucho said.
NC State Board of Elections member Bob Rucho (Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)
A Canadian citizen was charged late last month with illegally registering to vote in North Carolina and voting in federal elections in 2022 and 2024. 
Board member Jeff Carmon, a Democrat, said he hasn’t seen a widespread problem with noncitizen voting in his six years on the board, and told Rucho he shouldn’t have said staff wasn’t making a maximum effort. .
“What we’re doing is according to the law,” Carmon said. 
“Maybe the law is insane,” Board Chairman Francis De Luca interjected. 
Board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV, a Republican, said there’s still interest in using the federal SAVE database to verify voters’  citizenship. 
Elections officials are working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on a memo “that would lay out the parameters of any potential data exchange with regard to the last four of Social Security,” said state Elections Director Sam Hayes.
Officials want to work with the state DMV to obtain full Social Security numbers, Hayes said. 
A bill proposed by House Republicans would require voters to supply their full Social Security numbers when registering. Voting and privacy experts told NC Newsline that provision would violate federal privacy law. 
The DVM, however, collects full Social Security numbers. 
Hayes said lawmakers are working on legislation “that would compel that data sharing, and we’re certainly supportive of that as well.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071581-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-08 14:58:18.711770

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier will not defend a fatal road rage case prosecuted by state attorney Monique Worrell if any conviction goes to an appeals court, he warned in a Monday letter.
Instead, he may ask Gov. Ron DeSantis to suspend her. Again. It would be the latest strike in a lengthy feud between the DeSantis administration and Worrell, Orange County’s Democratic chief prosecutor, who only just retook her seat after the governor removed her from office.
Uthmeier will insist Worrell made a “plain error” in choosing to prosecute Tina Allgeo — a 47-year-old woman who shot and killed a man who attacked her in her car during a December road rage incident — if Allgeo is convicted and appeals her case. Uthmeier will also evaluate whether “further intervention is warranted.”
Monique Worrell via her webpage
“Your decision to pursue this case as you have despite Allgeo’s self-defense immunity under at least two Florida statutes may very likely require my office to admit plain error on appeal,” Uthmeier wrote in the letter, accusing Worrell of ignoring the state’s “stand your ground” laws allowing self-defense killings.
Uthmeier just hours later asked Worrell to investigate a former state senator for posting the whereabouts of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents. He wondered whether the ex-lawmaker, Linda Stewart, was “harassing” law enforcement.
As Florida’s chief legal officer, Uthmeier exercises a general “superintendence” role over Florida’s 20 elected state attorneys, although they function independently of him. The power to suspend a state attorney lies solely with the governor.
“Your actions likely constitute a breach of your ethical obligations. And they may also constitute misfeasance, malfeasance, neglect of duty, and incompetence,” he continued, reciting the Florida Constitution’s provisions allowing the governor to suspend an out-of-line officeholder.
“I strongly urge you to reconsider your prosecution of Allgeo.”
When asked whether DeSantis would consider suspending Worrell, the governor’s office pointed to DeSantis’s comments at the State Freedom Caucus last week:
“If you are a prosecutor, particularly those funded by George Soros, please know that if you don’t enforce the law, I will remove you from your post.”
DeSantis ousts another Democratic prosecutor — Monique Worrell of Orange County

The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Allgeo in February for the second-degree murder with a firearm of 42-year-old Mihail Tsvetkov. Surveillance footage shows Allgeo outside of her car, taking photos of Tsvetkov’s plates. When Tsvetkov drove away, she pursued him and struck his car with hers.
A red light camera video then follows Tsvetkov as he exits his car, yanks open Allgeo’s car door, and begins to beat her, seemingly attempting to pull her out of her vehicle. Allgeo then pulls the trigger on her firearm, shooting Tsvetkov “in the face” and killing him almost instantly, News 6 reported.
Allgeo later said that she initially confronted Tsvetkov because he tailgated her and allegedly purposely hit her car with his own.
“This is a case of great public importance that needed to be reviewed by the Grand Jury to determine whether the evidence supported an indictment,” Worrell said after the grand jury indictment. “Gun violence stemming from senseless disputes will not be tolerated, and our office will hold those who commit these acts accountable.”
This isn’t the first time Worrell and Uthmeier have clashed. In April, he accused her of both slow-walking and ignoring a mounting backlog of cases. He called a press conference to send six statewide prosecutors to help her with the workload, jabbing at her alleged ties to Democrat mega-donor Soros in the process.
This followed weeks of back-and-forth between the legal politicos, which involved accusations of Worrell being “soft on crime” and Uthmeier being “uninformed.”
Before Uthmeier was sworn in as attorney general in February, he served as DeSantis’s chief of staff. He held this title in August 2023, when DeSantis suspended Worrell for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
Although Worrell failed to get the Florida Supreme Court to overturn her suspension, she won a second term in November. This unseated Andrew Bain, whom DeSantis had appointed to replace her. DeSantis had also suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren but he failed for re-election last year.
“You may not like Florida’s self-defense laws,” Uthmeier wrote Monday. “But those laws reflect the simple truth that a Floridian — a woman in this case — has the right to use deadly force to stop a man from brutalizing or killing her.”
Worrell’s office did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publishing.

The former executive director of the Vermont Council of Special Education Administrators was charged with felony embezzlement, the Montpelier Police Department said in a press release Friday.
Darren McIntrye, who served as the head of the organization from 2021 to 2023, embezzled more than $76,000 from the organization and used the funds “for personal gain,” police alleged in the release.
The investigation began in October 2024, when the organization reported the “misappropriation of company funds” to the Montpelier Police Department, Alesha Donovan, a police detective with the department, said in the release.
The Vermont Council of Special Education Administrators has been active in Vermont for decades, supporting special education administrators and employees in school districts across the state.

Photo by Jon King.Last week’s passage of a student bathroom bill showcases a disturbing, yet all-too-familiar GOP strategy: demonize marginalized communities to hide failures elsewhere.
In this case, the failure is putting forth a realistic state budget proposal just weeks before a government shutdown.
Evidently, when the budget calendar counts down to zero, the distraction playbook pulls transgender students into the crosshairs.
The Republican-led Michigan House’s approval of House Bill 4024, a measure specifying bathroom and locker-room access by sex assigned at birth effectively bans transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity.
Setting aside the fact that enforcing such a law is impractical at best (after all, who is going to be in charge of double-checking genitalia?), or that the bill has zero chance of being taken up by Democrats in charge of the Senate, advocates argue it is a direct violation of the Elliott‑Larsen Civil Rights Act, an act enshrined in the Michigan Constitution, which lawmakers swear an oath to uphold, not undermine.
A day earlier, House Republicans stood at a press conference digging in their heels on budget talks, as Speaker Matt Hall touted his caucus’ $3.4 billion proposal for new road investments while essentially doubling down by accusing Senate Democrats of stonewalling a road funding plan.
But that was little more than smoke and mirrors: negotiations have stalled all while an Oct. 1 government shutdown looms with essential services – from school lunches to public safety – on the chopping block.
What’s clear is this: the House GOP prefers staging an attack on marginalized kids over passing tangible solutions. If the state shuts down, no amount of moral fervor around who uses which bathroom will register with families facing disruption, especially not with students denied programs, teachers left unpaid, or police understaffed.
Repeating history, members of this caucus can’t even justify their cuts with a coherent budget plan, so they resort instead to scapegoating.
Dismantling transgender rights isn’t progress. It’s a cynical, cowardly dodge when voters ask: “What are you doing about our schools? Our safety net?”
Let’s not be distracted. The fight for civil rights is non-negotiable, and it’s being used to distract from budgetary neglect.
Strong leadership means facing tough choices – not shirking responsibility and demonizing kids who deserve better.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser led a group of 20 Democratic state attorneys general in a letter blasting the “undue influence” that reportedly led to the U.S. Department of Justice’s approval of a $14 billion deal between IT giants Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks.
The DOJ’s Antitrust Division sued in January to block HPE’s proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks, which would lead to just two companies — HPE and Cisco Systems — controlling roughly 75% of the networking equipment market. But the Trump administration shifted course in June, agreeing to approve the deal in a settlement that included minor concessions from the companies, and a month later it fired two top antitrust officials who had worked on the case.
Citing news reports that senior DOJ officials were “lobbied by individuals with close ties to the President’s administration,” the letter says that the federal judge hearing the case should subject the proposed settlement to further review under a 1974 law known as the Tunney Act.

“The U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division must operate under the rule of law and decide antitrust cases based on principles applied equally to all companies — regardless of their political ties,” Weiser said in a press release Friday. “The allegations made about this settlement, and the defects of this settlement on its face, call out for scrutiny. Thankfully, the Tunney Act was enacted for just this purpose and can achieve its goal of ensuring that sunlight provides ‘the best of disinfectants.’”
Weiser, a 2026 candidate for Colorado governor, wrote in the letter to Leslie Wulff, civil chief of the DOJ Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Office, that in light of the “explosive and dangerous accusations” of corruption in the deal’s approval, Colorado and other states are “prepared to participate in further proceedings” to block the merger.
“The Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and require discovery into the Settlement and the allegedly corrupt process that led to it,” the letter says. “And if, upon exposing the settlement to sunlight, the evidence establishes that it was the product of undue influence, then the Court should reject it as against the public interest.”
In a separate letter on Sept. 4 to Republican and Democratic members of Congress, Weiser also called for congressional scrutiny of the deal.
“I strongly urge your committees to hold hearings to examine this case and to call attention to the importance of protecting impartial and fair merger review by the Antitrust Division,” wrote Weiser. “Your committees’ oversight obligations can provide necessary scrutiny to ensure that the Antitrust Division is truly acting according to its statutory duties and in the public’s best interest — and particularly to shed light on the troubling allegations surrounding this merger review.”

Sept. 6, 2025 | Photo providedMore than 200 members and supporters of a group opposing ICE enforcement and detainment policies gathered over the weekend outside of the reopened Michigan processing facility in Baldwin, formerly known as the North Lake Correctional Facility.
A large focus of the rally was to protest what members of No Detention Centers in Michigan have called punitive cancellations of family and attorney visits.
“Cancelling family visitation is a cruel, punitive and arbitrary response,” said Mindy Domke, a member of No Detention Centers in Michigan. “The GEO Group did not have to do this. They are looking for any excuse to isolate people even further, extending their fundamental practice of cutting off our immigrant friends and loved ones from their support networks and the outside world. It’s yet another reminder of why we oppose the system of immigration detention in the first place.”

Domke also noted that attorney visits had also been described as “unavailable” up until this past Sunday.
Attendees traveled from across the state in solidarity with the hundreds of immigrants now held at the Baldwin facility, which is operated by the federal government through GEO Group, a Florida-based private prison company.
Reports have emerged of harsh conditions at the facility, a trend reflecting the long history of ICE and other federal correctional detention facilities, with immigrants describing inadequate food and delays in their legal cases – and the latter leading indefinite terms of confinement.
“The members and movements of Fountain Street have stood beside you and will continue to stand beside you,” said Rev. Nathan Dannison of Fountain Street Church in Grand Rapids in a recorded message to the crowd. “You have allies in the faithful people of Grand Rapids. Any Christian who knows their Bible can tell you, somewhere inside the North Lake facility, a baby is being born into a manger. Somewhere inside the North Lake concentration camp, the soldiers of GEO Group are nailing Jesus Christ to the cross. Your actions today will serve as a testimony to our grandchildren—that we refused. … Enough!”

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
The U.S. Supreme Court today granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to lift a temporary restraining order barring federal immigration officials from conducting “roving patrols” and profiling people based on their appearance in Los Angeles and Southern California.
The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters. It means immigration agents can legally resume aggressive street sweeps that began in early June in Los Angeles, the epicenter for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 majority, agreed with the Trump administration that federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate individuals about whether they are lawfully in the United States and that they can rely on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion. That means everything the officer knew and observed at the time of the stop.
The U.S. Supreme Court took the case through its emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, is used for cases that are handled speedily with limited briefing and typically no oral argument. The justices relied on briefs from the Trump administration and from California government officials.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion explaining his reasoning in lifting restrictions on Los Angeles immigration sweeps. “Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English,” he wrote.
“To be clear,” he continued, “ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”
The three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissented from the majority, stressing that they objected to the court lifting limitations on immigration sweeps without oral argument and through the emergency docket, which the Trump administration used extensively this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in at least 17 cases in a row now.
“That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissent.  “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. “
Los Angeles and dozens of other Southern California municipalities wrote in an amicus brief supporting the restraining order that, because of the population makeup that “half the population of the Central District” meets the federal government’s criteria for being stopped and questioned about their immigration status. It means officers can rely on little more than a person is located in the parking lot of a Home Depot and speaking Spanish to question someone about their immigration status.
The ruling means the Border Patrol can resume the aggressive tactics a district federal judge said violated people’s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.
In a brief asking justices to remove restrictions on immigration stops, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security wrote that the lower-court injunction interfered with agents’ efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants.
“The injunction raises the specter of contempt for every stop in the district, threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop. It chills the exercise of Executive authority and usurps the President’s Article II powers to enforce our immigration laws,” attorneys for the Trump administration wrote.
 Why courts paused ‘roving patrols’

The district court found, based on a “mountain of evidence,” that the government engaged in a pattern of conducting stops without reasonable suspicion—relying solely on traits like race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, the location a person is in, and the type of work a person does.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the lower court’s ruling, chiding the Trump administration for misrepresenting the restraining order in their appeal.
“If, as the Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing … stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit wrote.
A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers, sought the order, arguing the LA-area raids have violated people’s rights by allowing federal immigration agents to stop people who simply appear to be Latino, including U.S. citizens.
“The federal government is seeking to detain individuals solely because they are not white, speak Spanish or speak accented English. That idea is anathema to everything the United States stands for, and it should be rejected,” a group of cities in Los Angeles County wrote in amicus brief supporting restrictions on immigration agents. They wrote that this summer’s raids had “sown terror” in their communities.
 LA immigration sweeps continued

Despite the previous order barring profiling, agents have continued an aggressive enforcement blitz in the nation’s second-largest city.
About 40 agents hit a Westlake Home Depot on Aug. 28, using tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse a crowd before detaining eight people, a Border Patrol official confirmed Friday. That’s the same location where agents previously made a hype video set to rap music of themselves hiding in a Penske rental truck before bursting out to detain day laborers in a raid dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.
Under Operation-At-Large Chief Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol has detained Latino daylaborers, swarming Home Depots and carwashes across the nation’s second largest city. Bovino has vowed to bring similar tactics to cities across the country.
Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law said the federal government’s racial profiling has consequences beyond immigration enforcement. He wrote to CalMatters and also in a paper for the SMU Law Review that “race-based immigration enforcement undermines Latina/o sense of belonging in the national community for generations.”
“Importantly, the Trump administration’s campaign against people of color goes well beyond immigration law and immigrants. As exemplified by the administration’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the President has sought to eliminate programs that seek to promote the full integration of racial and other minorities into U.S. society,” Johnson wrote.

That’s the message public health advocates want to spread today, throughout September (which is Suicide Awareness Month), and throughout the coming year to bring attention to the 988 suicide crisis lifeline and the role it can play in saving someone’s life.
“It’s really trying to bring attention that when somebody is in crisis or they’re having thoughts of suicide, that all they have to do is call 988. It doesn’t matter how big their issue is, how small they may think it is, 988 is always going to be available anytime and anywhere,” said Clara Reynolds, president and CEO of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, which answers the 988 line in Hillsborough County. The center is one of 13 around the state that answer the hotline.

Congress established the 988 line in 2020 to replace the old 10-digit call number, to make it easier for people to remember the digits and access the necessary help. Truncating the call line to just three digits, along with increased attention to suicide prevention efforts, has helped, Reynolds said. She also gives credit to law enforcement agencies and the news media for  promoting the line.
“We went from, you know, about 10 to 15 suicide calls a day up to an average of about 50, right now, suicide calls a day, “she said. 
“No matter how big your problem may be or how small you think your problem is, there is help, available, compassionate help, anytime, anywhere. It doesn’t matter where you are across our country or across the state, from Pensacola to Defuniak Springs, Jacksonville to Key West. All you have to know is you can call 988 at any time and receive help from somebody who is specially trained to listen to you, help you feel like you’re actually being heard, and help you get to your place of better — whatever that needs to look like for you.”

Suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in Florida, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show. Florida’s age-adjusted suicide rate in 2023 was 14.38 deaths per 100,000 population, slightly higher than the 14.1 age-adjusted rate for the previous year. The state saw 3,620 deaths from suicide in 2023.
Nationally, more than 49,000 people died by suicide in 2023. CDC data show that 12.8 million people contemplated suicide, 3.7 million people made a suicide plan, and 1.5 million people tried to commit suicide.
The hotline is funded through a blend of federal and state dollars, Reynolds said, and different states fund the hotline differently. Some agree to a separate tax on telephone bills, similar to an assessment, to support 911. In Florida, the 988 hotline is funded through the state budget, including grants from the Department of Children and Families. 
“Some local counties are also providing additional resources, just to make sure, again, that 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, access is available,” Reynolds said.
Transcending generations

Tampa Bay real estate agent Nicole Gossett helps to promote the 988 hotline in her area.
Perhaps no one knows the price of suicide than Gossett, whose grandfather, father, and brother committed suicide. September — her father’s birth month — begins a 16-week span in which painful memories can come back. Her father killed himself in October — next month marks the 13th anniversary.
Her birthday is in November, and December is the month her brother killed himself. In January, her grandfather killed himself. She was just 10 years old at the time.
“So, I come into months of just like,’ What’s wrong with me?’ And then I realize, ‘Oh yeah, that’s what’s going on with me.’ Because no matter how hard I don’t want to remember, it happens, and it’s just the memories are so present,” Gossett told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. 
“I try to flip the dialogue in my own brain and celebrate them. My dad loved Mexican food and margaritas, so I always have to have Mexican food and margaritas on his birthday and the day that we lost him. And my brother and I, just as kids, we loved Wendy’s. And so I get myself Wendy’s for his.”
Gossett stresses that the 988 line isn’t just for those feeling suicidal. It could be for the friends, family, or co-workers who know someone feeling suicidal.
“For the people that are being reached out to, if you’re not a professional, that’s a lot of information to take, and you may not know what to do. You as an individual receiving that someone is having a hard time, you need to call 988, to get professional advice to know how to guide that person,” Gossett said.
“Reach out and say, ‘So someone’s reached out to me. I don’t know how to help them. Can you please guide me? What resources do you have for me? Can I try to get you on a call with them? ‘You, we, as individuals who are not trained, we need the support, and it is there for us too.”

The move will force Shenandoah Valley residents to travel further for their primary and emergency health care needs. 
Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal legislation entails forthcoming changes to Medicaid that’s projected to lead to enrollment drop offs and  big tweaks to hospital funding mechanisms. 
First reported by WHSV3, and according to a press release from Augusta Medical Group, Augusta Medical Group’s decision is part of the “ongoing response” to the OBBA and “the resulting realities for healthcare delivery.” 
Affected facilities are Buena Vista Primary Care, Churchville Primary Care and Weyers Cave Urgent Care. 
Buena Vista patients have already been contacted and reassigned to either August Health Maury River Family Practice or Augusta Primary Care in Lexington, each about 10 miles away. 
Churchville patients are encouraged to go to August Health Family Practice in Verona, also about 10 miles away. The release noted that it is open five days a week, while the Churchville facility had previously operated three days per week. 
Weyers Cave patients will need to travel further to access other Augusta Health urgent care locations in Stuarts Draft, Staunton, Waynesboro, or Crozet. Meanwhile, the company plans to deploy its mobile clinic to Weyer’s Cave to meet people where they are, but it’s unclear how frequently that would happen as of the time of this publication.
About 21% of 6th Congressional District residents are on Medicaid, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. The 6th District includes much of Shenandoah Valley and is represented in Congress by Republican Rep. Ben Cline, who voted in favor of the OBBA this summer.
Most Republicans — including all of Virginia’s Republican congressional delegation — supported the President Donald Trump-backed bill, though some took issue with the health care portions of it. U.S. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, had urged Congress to reconsider those portions of the bill, before ultimately voting for it anyway. All of Virginia’s Democratic delegation opposed the bill. 
Last week, U.S. Sen Mark Warner urged health systems to “be transparent” about any struggles they encounter amid the fallout of the legislation, much like Augusta Health has done. 
Augusta Health serves about 200,000 people in Shenandoah Valley to include Augusta County, Staunton, Waynesboro and surrounding areas across hospitals and clinics including the ones that are closing. The company is the largest local private employer in the area. According to its website, it employs over 2,000 people and has over 200 physicians. It’s unclear how many staff and medical professionals have been let go amid the closure of the three clinics. 
The Mercury’s call to Augusta Health to ask about lay offs and the mobile clinic was directed to a line that wasn’t answered and an inbox that was not accepting new voicemail. 
Kris Doan, president of Augusta Medical Group relayed in the press release that “these decisions are never easy, but demonstrate Augusta Health’s commitment to deploying innovative access strategies for addressing demand at the neighborhood level.”
He added that the choice was “necessary” to ensure the future of Augusta Health’s footprint in the region as a health care provider. 
“We remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of the Shenandoah Valley while keeping our patients at the center of everything we do,” he said.

Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that she will defend her state’s abortion protections in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas. James’ involvement sets up the first interstate fight over abortion laws since the fall of Roe v. Wade, opening the door for the Supreme Court to weigh in on a key legal mechanism that has helped people in states with bans access abortion.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a civil suit against Dr. Margaret Carpenter in December for providing a telehealth abortion to a Texas-based patient. Carpenter lives and practices in New York, where abortion is legal; in Texas, where her patient received the health care, there is an almost total ban on abortion. 
New York is one of several states where abortion providers are protected by shield laws — statutes that ban cooperation with other states’ attempts to enforce abortion bans. The law prohibits New York law enforcement officials from arresting or extraditing health professionals who provided abortions that are legal in New York; law enforcement also cannot cooperate with investigations or punishments of such procedures.
By setting up a clash between two states’ chief law enforcement offices, James’ intervention increases the likelihood that the New York-Texas dispute becomes a vehicle for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the constitutionality of shield laws and the telehealth abortions they enable. 
This month, James, the first woman and first Black person to serve as her state’s attorney general, will argue in legal filings that the Empire State has the right to pass laws protecting its residents from another state’s abortion bans.
“Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here,” James said in a statement.
The implications are significant. Since Roe’s undoing, tens of thousands of people living under abortion bans have relied on telehealth to get care. Health providers living in states with legal abortion consult with them virtually and then have abortion pills mailed to them to take from home. Now, about 1 in 4 abortions are done through telehealth — and half of those are for people receiving shield-law-protected care. The practice is medically safe and effective and often easier and more affordable for patients than traveling to another state. 
But the legality is fraught.
Supporters of the practice argue that, because the medical providers are practicing in their home states where abortion is legal they are not violating any laws. Abortion opponents say the opposite: that because the abortion ultimately occurs in a state where the procedure is banned, telehealth providers are breaking the law and must be punished accordingly.
Legal analysts have said the legality of shield laws will likely be decided by the Supreme Court. Several cases are pending that address abortions allegedly provided over telehealth to patients in states with bans, including a criminal case brought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and two civil cases both filed by anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell.
In February, a judge in a Texas state court ruled against Carpenter, saying she had to pay a penalty of $113,000. But New York state officials have refused to enforce the ruling, citing the state’s shield laws. Carpenter herself has not entered Texas. Then in July, Paxton sued the Ulster County, New York, clerk for declining to enter the Texas judgement against Carpenter. In that petition, he argued that New York’s shield law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit clause, which requires that states honor other states’ judicial proceedings.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_PlannedParenthood_2022-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

Read it here.
La Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos concedió hoy la solicitud de emergencia de la administración Trump de levantar una orden de restricción temporal que prohíbe a los funcionarios federales de inmigración realizar “ patrullas itinerantes ” y perfilar a las personas en función de su apariencia en Los Ángeles y el sur de California.
 Es probable que el caso tenga un enorme impacto, no solo en Los Ángeles, sino en todo el país, según informaron varios expertos a CalMatters. Esto significa que los agentes de inmigración pueden reanudar legalmente las agresivas redadas callejeras que comenzaron a principios de junio en Los Ángeles, epicentro de la campaña de deportaciones masivas del presidente Donald Trump.
En un fallo de 31 páginas, la Corte Suprema, por una mayoría de 6 a 3, coincidió con la administración Trump en que los agentes federales de inmigración pueden detener e interrogar brevemente a personas para determinar si se encuentran legalmente en Estados Unidos y que pueden basarse en el criterio de “totalidad de circunstancias” para determinar una sospecha razonable. 
El expediente de emergencia de la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos se utiliza para casos que se tramitan con rapidez, con información limitada y, por lo general, sin argumentos orales. Los jueces suelen emitir órdenes sin firmar y con escasa o ninguna explicación.
 El fallo significa que la Patrulla Fronteriza puede reanudar las tácticas agresivas que un juez federal de distrito dijo que violaban los derechos constitucionales de la Cuarta Enmienda de las personas contra registros e incautaciones irrazonables.
 En un escrito pidiendo a los jueces que eliminen las restricciones a las detenciones de inmigrantes, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de Trump escribió que la orden judicial inferior interfería con los esfuerzos de los agentes para expulsar a inmigrantes no autorizados.
 “La orden judicial plantea la posibilidad de desacato por cada parada en el distrito, amenazando a los agentes con sanciones si el tribunal no cree que se basaron en factores adicionales para realizar una parada en particular. Bloquea el ejercicio de la autoridad ejecutiva y usurpa las facultades del Presidente, amparadas por el Artículo II, para hacer cumplir nuestras leyes de inmigración”, escribieron los abogados de la administración Trump.
El tribunal de distrito encontró, basándose en una “montaña de evidencia”, que el gobierno realizó detenciones sin sospecha razonable, basándose únicamente en rasgos como la raza o la etnia, hablar español o inglés con acento, la ubicación en la que se encuentra una persona y el tipo de trabajo que realiza una persona.
 El Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito confirmó el fallo del tribunal inferior, criticando a la administración Trump por tergiversar la orden de restricción en su apelación.
 “Si, como sugieren los demandados, no están realizando controles que carecen de sospecha razonable, difícilmente pueden afirmar que se ven perjudicados irreparablemente por una orden judicial destinada a impedir… controles que no están respaldados por una sospecha razonable”, escribió el panel de tres jueces del 9º Circuito.
 Una coalición de agencias de derechos civiles, derechos de los inmigrantes y gobiernos locales, incluida la Unión Estadounidense por las Libertades Civiles y los Trabajadores Agrícolas Unidos, solicitaron la orden, argumentando que las redadas en el área de Los Ángeles han violado los derechos de las personas al permitir que los agentes federales de inmigración detengan a personas que simplemente parecen ser latinas, incluidos ciudadanos estadounidenses.
 “El gobierno federal busca detener a personas únicamente por no ser blancas, hablar español o hablar inglés con acento. Esa idea es un anatema para todo lo que representa Estados Unidos y debe ser rechazada”, escribió un grupo de ciudades del condado de Los Ángeles en un escrito amicus, apoyando las restricciones a los agentes de inmigración. Escribieron que las redadas de este verano habían “sembrado el terror” en sus comunidades.
 A pesar de la orden anterior que prohibía la elaboración de perfiles, los agentes han continuado con una agresiva ofensiva para aplicar la ley en la segunda ciudad más grande del país.

The House seat will be up for grabs in next year’s election because Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor. 
Gronli filed her Federal Election Commission statement of candidacy Monday morning and will launch her campaign at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday at the Holiday Inn City Centre in downtown Sioux Falls. Sioux Falls nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney announced last month he is running for the Democratic nomination as well.

If both stay in the race until next June’s primary, it’ll be the party’s first U.S. House primary race in South Dakota since 2012. The party did not have U.S. House candidates in the 2020 and 2022 elections.
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley has announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for the seat. Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, of Madison, filed his statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission this summer.
Gronli set out across South Dakota with other Democrats this spring to hold town hall meetings for South Dakotans concerned about federal policy changes under the Trump administration. 
“As I traveled the state and listened to people, I realized there might be a place for me in this,” Gronli said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “There might be an opportunity to continue to listen to them and bring forward their ideas and voices and be that voice in D.C.”

Gronli is the former vice chair of the South Dakota Democratic Party and former state director for USDA Rural Development under the Biden administration. She oversaw investments in rural housing, broadband, infrastructure and other rural community projects. She is president of Flatlander Strategies, a marketing company.
Concerns about the economy, health care access and President Trump’s tariff policies “devastating” South Dakota farmers drove Gronli’s decision to enter the race. 
“I’m watching our current elected leaders not do what’s best for South Dakota,” Gronli said. “I’ve decided that I need to get in this race and give people another option. We need some folks who have the courage to stand up for South Dakota families.”
Besides Crabtree and Jackley, James Bialota, who describes himself as a small business owner and real estate investor, has said on Facebook that he plans to run as a Republican for the U.S. House.
A Democrat named Scott Schlagel has also filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the seat.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia has launched a new online chat tool, mandated in a Republican bill, that is supposed to improve communication between foster parents, social workers and others involved in a child’s case.
While the project missed its initial July deadline from lawmakers, the state Department of Human Services partially rolled out the system last week and said it will soon be statewide. The project will cost more than $5 million over five years.
“I believe it can be a gamechanger for every aspect of child welfare, and I look forward to the full implementation as quickly as we can,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a sponsor of the bill.
West Virginia’s foster care system has more than 6,000 kids.
Lawmakers have struggled to address widespread problems in West Virginia’s overwhelmed system, and they’ve tried to use legislation to mandate changes from DoHS.
House Bill 4975, signed into law last year, was the brainchild of Burkhammer and Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, who are both foster parents. 
The pair said – based on their experiences fostering – there were major communication breakdowns between foster parents, Child Protective Services workers, attorneys and others involved in a child’s case. The problem contributed to children lingering in the system without permanency and foster parents closing their homes due to frustration, bill sponsors said. 
The legislation required DoHS to create a centralized communication tool for individuals involved in a child’s case by July 1. 
DoHS pushed the launch to September mainly to secure federal dollars to help pay for the technology. Brandon Lewis, chief of technology and information for DoHS, told lawmakers that the tool – named “COMETP” – partially rolled out last week.
“Right now, we started in Randolph County,” Lewis told the Joint Committee on Children and Families, which met Sunday during September Legislative Interim Meetings in Charleston. 
“You reduce the risk of other issues and problems that can be addressed by one county at a time,” he continued. “We will slowly roll out over the next, I would say two to three months.”
COMET stands for “communication and operations mobile engagement tool.” 
Lewis said the state’s contract with Cardinality.ai, an AI-solutions company for government, would cost $5.4 million for five years. Additionally, the state is paying Optum, which facilitates many online DoHS systems, to help roll out COMET. 
The state’s roughly $300 million contract with Optum has been a source of frustration for some lawmakers after DoHS and the tech company failed to meet the 2020 deadline for creating an online management system for foster care, Medicaid and more. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the project, a DoHS leader said last year. The system, known as PATH, is now operational.
CPS workers and others in Randolph County have begun using the COMET system for communication, Lewis said. State foster care leaders are working on communicating to foster parents and others that the chat tool is now available. 
“I think as we start rolling this out, we will start seeing more and more and more utilization of other tools,” Lewis said. 
DoHS is required, according to the bill, to provide quarterly reports to lawmakers about the communication tool’s use. Lewis said those reports will begin now that the product has launched.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/COMET.jpg,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

For some, the wait is agonizing","Sophie Bates, Associated Press, Alex Rozier, Illan Ireland, Mississippi Free Press, David A. Lieb, The Associated Press and M.K.

Seconds later, a tornado tore apart Anthony’s home and damaged the truck while lifting it partly in the air. Anthony emerged unhurt. But he had to replace his vehicle with a used truck that became his home while waiting for President Donald Trump to issue a major disaster declaration so that federal money would be freed for individuals reeling from loss. That took weeks. 
“You wake up in the truck and look out the windshield and see nothing. That’s hard. That’s hard to swallow,” Anthony said.

Disaster survivors are having to wait longer to get aid from the federal government, according to a new Associated Press analysis of decades of data. On average, it took less than two weeks for a governor’s request for a presidential disaster declaration to be granted in the 1990s and early 2000s. That rose to about three weeks during the past decade under presidents from both major parties. It’s taking more than a month, on average, during Trump’s current term, the AP found.
The delays mean individuals must wait to receive federal aid for daily living expenses, temporary lodging and home repairs. Delays in disaster declarations also can hamper recovery efforts by local officials uncertain whether they will receive federal reimbursement for cleaning up debris and rebuilding infrastructure. The AP collaborated with Mississippi Today and Mississippi Free Press on the effects of these delays for this report.
“The message that I get in the delay, particularly for the individual assistance, is that the federal government has turned its back on its own people,” said Bob Griffin, dean of the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at the University at Albany in New York. “It’s a fundamental shift in the position of this country.”


The wait for disaster aid has grown as Trump remakes government
The Federal Emergency Management Agency often consults immediately with communities to coordinate their initial disaster response. But direct payments to individuals, nonprofits and local governments must wait for a major disaster declaration from the president, who first must receive a request from a state, territory or tribe. Major disaster declarations are intended only for the most damaging events that are beyond the resources of states and local governments.
Trump has approved more than two dozen major disaster declarations since taking office in January, with an average wait of almost 34 days after a request. That ranged from a one-day turnaround after July’s deadly flash flooding in Texas to a 67-day wait after a request for aid because of a Michigan ice storm. The average wait is up from a 24-day delay during his first term and is nearly four times as long as the average for former Republican President George H.W. Bush, whose term from 1989-1993 coincided with the implementation of a new federal law setting parameters for disaster determinations. 
The delays have grown over time, regardless of the party in power. Former Democratic President Joe Biden, in his last year in office, averaged 26 days to declare major disasters — longer than any year under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

FEMA did not respond to the AP’s questions about what factors are contributing to the trend.
Others familiar with FEMA noted that its process for assessing and documenting natural disasters has become more complex over time. Disasters have also become more frequent and intense because of climate change, which is mostly caused by the burning of fuels such as gas, coal and oil.
The wait for disaster declarations has spiked as Trump’s administration undertakes an ambitious makeover of the federal government that has shed thousands of workers and reexamined the role of FEMA. A recently published letter from current and former FEMA employees warned the cuts could become debilitating if faced with a large-enough disaster. The letter also lamented that the Trump administration has stopped maintaining or removed long-term planning tools focused on extreme weather and disasters.
Shortly after taking office, Trump floated the idea of “getting rid” of FEMA, asserting: “It’s very bureaucratic, and it’s very slow.”
FEMA’s acting chief suggested more recently that states should shoulder more responsibility for disaster recovery, though FEMA thus far has continued to cover three-fourths of the costs of public assistance to local governments, as required under federal law. FEMA pays the full cost of its individual assistance.
Former FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who served during Trump’s first term, said the delay in issuing major disaster declarations likely is related to a renewed focus on making sure the federal government isn’t paying for things state and local governments could handle.
“I think they’re probably giving those requests more scrutiny,” Gaynor said. “And I think it’s probably the right thing to do, because I think the (disaster) declaration process has become the ‘easy button’ for states.”

In Mississippi, frustration festered during wait for aid
The tornado that struck Anthony’s home in rural Tylertown on March 15 packed winds up to 140 mph. It was part of a powerful system that wrecked homes, businesses and lives across multiple states.
Mississippi’s governor requested a federal disaster declaration on April 1. Trump granted that request 50 days later, on May 21, while approving aid for both individuals and public entities.
On that same day, Trump also approved eight other major disaster declarations for storms, floods or fires in seven other states. In most cases, more than a month had passed since the request and about two months since the date of those disasters.
If a presidential declaration and federal money had come sooner, Anthony said he wouldn’t have needed to spend weeks sleeping in a truck before he could afford to rent the trailer where he is now living. His house was uninsured, Anthony said, and FEMA eventually gave him $30,000. 
In nearby Jayess in Lawrence County, Dana Grimes had insurance but not enough to cover the full value of her damaged home. After the eventual federal declaration, Grimes said FEMA provided about $750 for emergency expenses, but she is now waiting for the agency to determine whether she can receive more.

“We couldn’t figure out why the president took so long to help people in this country,” Grimes said. “I just want to tie up strings and move on. But FEMA — I’m still fooling with FEMA.”
Jonathan Young said he gave up on applying for FEMA aid after the Tylertown tornado killed his 7-year-old son and destroyed their home. The process seemed too difficult, and federal officials wanted paperwork he didn’t have, Young said. He made ends meet by working for those cleaning up from the storm.
“It’s a therapy for me,” Young said, “to pick up the debris that took my son away from me.”
Historically, presidential disaster declarations containing individual assistance have been approved more quickly than those providing assistance only to public entities, according to the AP’s analysis. That remains the case under Trump, though declarations for both types are taking longer.
About half the major disaster declarations approved by Trump this year have included individual assistance.
Some people whose homes are damaged turn to shelters hosted by churches or local nonprofit organizations in the initial chaotic days after a disaster. Others stay with friends or family or go to a hotel, if they can afford it.
But some insist on staying in damaged homes, even if they are unsafe, said Chris Smith, who administered FEMA’s individual assistance division under three presidents from 2015-2022. If homes aren’t repaired properly, mold can grow, compounding the recovery challenges.

That’s why it’s critical for FEMA’s individual assistance to get approved quickly — ideally, within two weeks of a disaster, said Smith, who’s now a disaster consultant for governments and companies.
“You want to keep the people where they are living. You want to ensure those communities are going to continue to be viable and recover,” Smith said. “And the earlier that individual assistance can be delivered … the earlier recovery can start.”
In the periods waiting for declarations, the pressure falls on local officials and volunteers to care for victims and distribute supplies. 
In Walthall County, where Tylertown is, insurance agent Les Lampton remembered watching the weather news as the first tornado missed his house by just an eighth of a mile. Lampton, who moonlights as a volunteer firefighter, navigated the collapsed trees in his yard and jumped into action. About 45 minutes later, the second tornado hit just a mile away.
“It was just chaos from there on out,” Lampton said. 
Walthall County, with a population of about 14,000, hasn’t had a working tornado siren in about 30 years, Lampton said. He added there isn’t a public safe room in the area, although a lot of residents have ones in their home. 
Rural areas with limited resources are hit hard by delays in receiving funds through FEMA’s public assistance program, which, unlike individual assistance, only reimburses local entities after their bills are paid. Long waits can stoke uncertainty and lead cost-conscious local officials to pause or scale-back their recovery efforts.

In Walthall County, officials initially spent about $700,000 cleaning up debris, then suspended the cleanup for more than a month because they couldn’t afford to spend more without assurance they would receive federal reimbursement, said county emergency manager Royce McKee. Meanwhile, rubble from splintered trees and shattered homes remained piled along the roadside, creating unsafe obstacles for motorists and habitat for snakes and rodents.
When it received the federal declaration, Walthall County took out a multimillion-dollar loan to pay contractors to resume the cleanup.
“We’re going to pay interest and pay that money back until FEMA pays us,” said Byran Martin, an elected county supervisor. “We’re hopeful that we’ll get some money by the first of the year, but people are telling us that it could be [longer].”
Lampton, who took after his father when he joined the volunteer firefighters 40 years ago, lauded the support of outside groups such as Cajun Navy, Eight Days of Hope, Samaritan’s Purse and others. That’s not to mention the neighbors who brought their own skid steers and power saws to help clear trees and other debris, he added. 
“That’s the only thing that got us through this storm, neighbors helping neighbors,” Lampton said. “If we waited on the government, we were going to be in bad shape.”

The U.S. Supreme Court lifted limits on immigration sweeps in Southern California, overturning a lower court ruling that prohibited agents from stopping people based on their appearance.


The U.S. Supreme Court today granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to lift a temporary restraining order barring federal immigration officials from conducting “roving patrols” and profiling people based on their appearance in Los Angeles and Southern California.
The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters. It means immigration agents can legally resume aggressive street sweeps that began in early June in Los Angeles, the epicenter for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign. 
The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 majority, agreed with the Trump administration that federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate individuals about whether they are lawfully in the United States and that they can rely on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion. That means everything the officer knew and observed at the time of the stop. 
The U.S. Supreme Court took the case through its emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, is used for cases that are handled speedily with limited briefing and typically no oral argument. The justices relied on briefs from the Trump administration and from California government officials.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion explaining his reasoning in lifting restrictions on Los Angeles immigration sweeps. “Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English,” he wrote. 
“To be clear,” he continued, “ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”
The three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissented from the majority, stressing that they objected to the court lifting limitations on immigration sweeps without oral argument and through the emergency docket, which the Trump administration used extensively this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in at least 17 cases in a row now.
“That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissent.  “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. “ 
Los Angeles and dozens of other Southern California municipalities wrote in an amicus brief supporting the restraining order that, because of the population makeup that “half the population of the Central District” meets the federal government’s criteria for being stopped and questioned about their immigration status. It means officers can rely on little more than a person is located in the parking lot of a Home Depot and speaking Spanish to question someone about their immigration status.  
The ruling means the Border Patrol can resume the aggressive tactics a district federal judge said violated people’s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.
In a brief asking justices to remove restrictions on immigration stops, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security wrote that the lower-court injunction interfered with agents’ efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants. 
“The injunction raises the specter of contempt for every stop in the district, threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop. It chills the exercise of Executive authority and usurps the President’s Article II powers to enforce our immigration laws,” attorneys for the Trump administration wrote. 
Why courts paused ‘roving patrols’
The district court found, based on a “mountain of evidence,” that the government engaged in a pattern of conducting stops without reasonable suspicion—relying solely on traits like race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, the location a person is in, and the type of work a person does.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the lower court’s ruling, chiding the Trump administration for misrepresenting the restraining order in their appeal. 
“If, as the Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing … stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit wrote.   
A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers, sought the order, arguing the LA-area raids have violated people’s rights by allowing federal immigration agents to stop people who simply appear to be Latino, including U.S. citizens. 
“The federal government is seeking to detain individuals solely because they are not white, speak Spanish or speak accented English. That idea is anathema to everything the United States stands for, and it should be rejected,” a group of cities in Los Angeles County wrote in amicus brief supporting restrictions on immigration agents. They wrote that this summer’s raids had “sown terror” in their communities. 
LA immigration sweeps continued
Despite the previous order barring profiling, agents have continued an aggressive enforcement blitz in the nation’s second-largest city. 
About 40 agents hit a Westlake Home Depot on Aug. 28, using tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse a crowd before detaining eight people, a Border Patrol official confirmed Friday. That’s the same location where agents previously made a hype video set to rap music of themselves hiding in a Penske rental truck before bursting out to detain day laborers in a raid dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.
Under Operation-At-Large Chief Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol has detained Latino daylaborers, swarming Home Depots and carwashes across the nation’s second largest city. Bovino has vowed to bring similar tactics to cities across the country.
Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law said the federal government’s racial profiling has consequences beyond immigration enforcement. He wrote to CalMatters and also in a paper for the SMU Law Review that “race-based immigration enforcement undermines Latina/o sense of belonging in the national community for generations.” 
“Importantly, the Trump administration’s campaign against people of color goes well beyond immigration law and immigrants. As exemplified by the administration’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the President has sought to eliminate programs that seek to promote the full integration of racial and other minorities into U.S. society,” Johnson wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/062025-US-CBP-LA-Raids-GETTY-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 13:01:26.297293

BURLINGTON — Debbie Hazen recalls turning 6 when the nuns who ran the city’s former St. Joseph’s Orphanage locked her in an attic trunk in the early 1960s.
“They told me there were bats and snakes and spiders in there that were going to get me,” she said of the dark place.
Hazen never imagined she would eventually find herself outside the orphanage dedicating a “memorial healing space” for the more than 13,000 children who lived at the Catholic facility from its opening in 1854 to its closing in 1974.
“This has been a long time coming and quite the journey for all of us,” Hazen, now 70, told a crowd of 100 fellow survivors and supporters Friday. “For some, this will complete their healing. For others, there’s still much to do.”
The North Avenue memorial, which features a sculptural arbor and stones etched with the words of former orphanage residents, is the final project in a five-year restorative justice process.
“Your voices have been instrumental in shaping our approach to child protection,” Chris Winters, commissioner of the Vermont Department for Children and Families, told survivors. “This memorial is not just a reminder of the past, but it’s also a symbol of your resilience and of our commitment to a future where every child is safe.”

Former orphanage residents once feared no one would believe their memories of mistreatment, so they didn’t start publicizing their childhood conditions until the 1990s. But authorities didn’t launch an investigation until a 2018 BuzzFeed article exposed the full extent of past “unrelenting physical and psychological abuse.”
By 2020, the review confirmed “abuse did occur … and that many children suffered,” although the accusations were too old to pursue criminal charges. To compensate, local and state leaders initiated a “restorative justice inquiry” to help former residents push responsible parties to adopt measures “to ensure that these harms never happen again.”
Working with social service and legal professionals, former residents lobbied for a 2021 state law that eliminated time limits on filing civil lawsuits alleging childhood physical abuse — a success that won them the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services’ 2021 Survivor/Activist Award.
But the orphanage’s overseers — the state’s Roman Catholic Diocese, the Sisters of Providence and Vermont Catholic Charities — would not meet with survivors as a group nor consider requests for childhood records or restitution.
As part of the inquiry, participants told their stories through several public projects, including two anthologies, a Vermont Folklife-supported oral history and traveling exhibition, and journalist Christine Kenneally’s 2018 BuzzFeed exposé and 2023 follow-up book, “Ghosts of the Orphanage.”
Inquiry organizers also released a 176-page final report that summed up the restorative justice process as both “helpful and healing” and “difficult and painful.”
The new memorial rose with help from Burlington’s Department of Parks, Recreation & Waterfront and supporters who donated $160,000. The dedication featured current and former  local and state leaders as well as survivors who came from as far away as Florida.
“I would like to acknowledge all the unseen victims who have gone unnoticed,” said Debi Gevry, 62, whose father, struggling to care for her and her two siblings, placed them at the orphanage in the 1960s.
“He did so thinking he was doing what was best for his children,” she said in a speech. “On a mechanic’s wage, he paid for our keep not knowing the suffering we were enduring on a daily basis.”
Gevry, who said she wasn’t hugged until after leaving at age 12, went on to raise her own family.
“I have yet to heal from the traumas hidden deep in my soul,” she said. “I have unknowingly passed on my fears and anxieties to the next generation. This is just a small example of the ripple effect abuse carries.”
Gevry closed by reading a poem she wrote. Chiseled into a memorial stone, it’s punctuated by the refrain, “We will be remembered.”

(Photo courtesy campaign)Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor launched her bid for Congress Monday morning, less than three months after losing the Democratic nomination for Virginia attorney general to Jay Jones. Taylor now joins nine other Democratic candidates hoping to take on longtime Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman in November for the chance to represent Virginia’s First Congressional District for the next two years. 
With a track record as a hardline prosecutor, Taylor was first elected to serve as Henrico’s commonwealth’s attorney in 2011 and has spent three terms in the role. She has run for statewide office twice — both times in the Democratic primary for attorney general. In 2021, facing Jones and Mark Herring, she withdrew from the race. She chose not to run in order to “focus on the critical issues happening in Henrico from criminal justice reform to addressing longstanding systemic racism in our society,” Taylor said, according to WWBT. 
Herring won the nomination but lost the seat to Jason Miyares (who is now vying for reelection). Taylor’s loss to Jones in this year’s attorney general Democratic primary was a close one, with Jones edging Taylor with 51.5% of the votes to her 48.8%.

Taylor has set her sights on defeating Wittman, who has represented the 1st District since 2012, which spans from parts of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield Counties in Central Virginia to the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. There are over 471,000 registered voters in the district, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. 
The congressman has faced fierce public scrutiny for his support of the One Big Beautiful Bill and over 150 of constituents called him out in the spring for failing to appear in person at town halls to address his stance supporting the federal measure, which is set to slash billions from Medicaid, and his backing of sweeping immigration reforms that advocates and Democratic lawmakers say circumvents due process and breaks up families. Wittman said at the time he values talking with Virginians and hosts telephone town halls to reach as many as possible at one time, including one in March that he said included over 9,000 people.

“As Henrico’s top prosecutor, I’ve made it my mission to protect and defend Virginia families by locking up violent criminals, taking on fraudsters and scammers, and getting drugs and guns off our streets to keep our community safe,” Taylor said in a statement Monday. “Now I’m taking on a new fight to prosecute the case against Rob Wittman because he has spent nearly 20 years in Washington enriching himself while selling out the very community I’ve fought to protect.”
Taylor is running on a platform of defending working Virginians and keeping communities safe. She has been endorsed by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who said Taylor has ensured justice for Henrico citizens “without fear or favor.”
“Since 2012, Shannon has worked to keep the residents of Henrico safe by prosecuting murders, drug dealers, and fraudsters, and standing up for victims and their families,” Kain said. “Now she is running to stand up for hardworking families in Virginia’s 1st District. As a friend of Shannon’s for more than 15 years, I’m proud to endorse her as she runs to serve as an independent leader in Congress for her community.”
A native of Charlottesville, Taylor was previously a prosecutor in Richmond before serving as a special assistant in the U.S. Attorney’s office. She was the first woman elected as Henrico’s commonwealth’s attorney and, according to her campaign office, was “one of the first prosecutors in America to say she would defend the right to abortion care” after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. 
Taylor is the latest Democrat to take aim against Wittman; Salaam Bhatti, Timothy Cywinski, Ericka Kopp, Andrew Lucchetti, Amanda Pohl, James Shea, Sean Sublette, Mel Tull and Lisa Vedernikova Khanna will face Taylor in a primary whose date is yet to be determined. The winner will face off against Wittman in the general election on Nov. 4. Early voting begins in Virginia Sept. 19.

Micah Beckwith addresses the property tax rally on March 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith on Friday landed himself in hot water with supporters over social media posts about Haitian asylum-seekers.
Beckwith, a pastor at Life Church’s Noblesville campus, met with Haitian pastors on Thursday to talk about “faith and family.”
“Their people have endured earthquakes and violence, and now more than 40,000 are seeking asylum here in Indiana,” he wrote on X. “We spoke about barriers of language and culture while also discussing the power of faith and family.”
“What I saw was not a community asking for a handout, but people determined to work hard, raise their children to become contributors to the great Hoosier state, and assimilate to the American way of life,” he added.
The backlash from fellow conservatives was swift.

X users swarmed to the comment section, accusing Beckwith of trying to bring 40,000 Haitian nationals to Indiana. Some called for his deportation to Haiti.
Conservative news figures from across the country amplified the post.
Beckwith backtracked, at first.
“Ultimately, advocating for firmness does not mean abandoning love,” he wrote in one reply. “I was letting these pastors know that they have a responsibility to care for their own community. It is their job to do that — it is not our job to fund them.”
He got direct.
“I am not advocating for us to have Haitians come to America or Indiana,” Beckwith wrote in another reply. “I am saying that if Haitians come to our state, they must do it legally, learn English, and assimilate to our culture.”

Then, he turned off the comments to his official X account and deleted his original post and replies. Another wave of commenters seethed.
Beckwith’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Critics flooded comments to his personal X account instead.

“This guy asked to come on my show for well over a year,” conservative talk show host Steve Deace wrote. “We finally booked him as a positive example of Christian conservative leadership to our audience. Had I known he advocated this, I would’ve never done so.”
“I’m not calling for them to come to the US… I’m saying that are already here because of the idiotic policies of the previous administration… which I condemn!” Beckwith replied.
He said the meeting was to implore the pastors to “step up and care for their own people because taxpayer resources are not for them.” He also directed them to encourage self-deportation for any congregants in Indiana illegally.
“I’ve been the most supportive statewide elected official of the Trump immigration policies in the entire state of Indiana and that has not changed,” Beckwith concluded.

(Photo courtesy of League of Women Voters Maine)Maine leaders are pushing back on a federal policy change that will bar nonprofits and other nonpartisan organizations from helping new citizens register to vote immediately upon taking their oath. 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is the federal agency responsible for conferring citizenship upon new Americans, updated its policies at the end of August so that only state and local election officials will be allowed to offer voter registration services at the end of naturalization ceremonies. Nongovernmental entities were immediately barred from providing these services as of Aug. 29, the date of the letter outlining the policy change. 
That includes volunteers from the League of Women Voters of Maine who have attended naturalization ceremonies for years to help new citizens register to vote. Before the change, League volunteers had attended every Friday naturalization ceremony in South Portland this year, as well as some in Bangor and Acadia National Park. 
“The policy is unnecessary and only serves to decrease the ability of new citizens to participate in our democracy,” the organization said in a news release Monday.
Naturalization ceremonies are typically public events at which individuals who have been undergoing the process of becoming citizens take their oath of allegiance to officially become U.S. citizens. At that time, the new citizen is allowed to register to vote and participate in elections. 
In the last year, more than 800 new citizens approached the nonpartisan political organization at these ceremonies to either register to vote or learn more about the process. 
The Maine chapter joined the national League of Women Voters in asking the USCIS to revoke the policy, calling it an attempt to keep new citizens from exercising their full rights. 
“We are not only disappointed in the new USCIS policy, we find it an unnecessary interruption of important volunteer work,“ said Jill Ward, president of the League of Women Voters of Maine board. “Volunteers come to the League to do this work to honor and celebrate our shared values around citizen engagement and voter rights. This policy runs directly counter to those values.”
The USCIS said in the letter that the change is being implemented in part because of the administrative burden to ensure that the nongovernmental agencies that provide voter registration services are nonpartisan. 
It goes on to say that the change “in no way impacts new citizens’ access to information and applications to register to vote” because those materials will still be provided by local election officials or USCIS staff. The agency also said online voter registration reduces the need for nongovernmental organizations to help new citizens submit applications. 
Maine offers online voter registration services for people who wish to register to vote in the state for the first time or need or update their information. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said her office is monitoring the decision to block community organizations from registering voters at these events and take on the work that nonprofits have historically done in this realm. 
“Until groups like the League of Women Voters can resume their longstanding tradition of registering new citizens as voters, our office will step in to support the rights of all citizens in Maine,” Bellows wrote in a statement she shared on social media last week.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 7.
WOODSTOCK — Vermont State Police are investigating the Windsor County Sheriff Department’s finances following an anonymous tip.
The Vermont State Police’s criminal division is involved in the investigation into “a financial matter regarding the sheriff’s office,” spokesperson Adam Silverman confirmed Thursday. The investigation started in mid-August because the division was “asked” to look into it. Silverman declined to provide further details.
As of Friday, Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer said he had not been contacted by Vermont State Police about the investigation but suggested that does not seem to be unusual. He confirmed that he learned about the investigation through media reports.
“I’m not hiding anything. I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t do anything illegal. There’s nothing to hide,” Palmer said in a Friday interview.
Palmer confirmed in an Aug. 29 Facebook post that he was aware of the investigation, denied any “wrongdoing or criminal behavior” and wrote that he understands the “serious nature of the claims and the public concern this may cause.”
Palmer also suggested on Facebook that the tip Vermont State Police received may have been politically motivated.
“I would also note that these complaints were submitted anonymously, as we approach the 2026 election year,” Palmer wrote at the end of his message.
When asked about this comment, Palmer said he did not know if the tip was politically motivated but said, “I guess we’ll have to wait and see, but it is coincidental at best.” He described the timing as “curious.”
Palmer, 38, was first elected as Windsor County’s sheriff in 2022.

He ran as a Democrat and campaigned on a platform of change for the department, which had been run for 40 nearly uninterrupted years by former Sheriff Michael Chamberlain, a Republican.
After winning the Democratic primary against Tom Battista, a longtime veteran of the department, Palmer prevailed again in November with 15,629 votes to Chamberlain’s 9,824. It was the first time Chamberlain faced a challenger in nearly 20 years.
Since his election, Palmer has grown the department both in staffing and coverage area and he has not shied away from spending money to do so.
As of the beginning of 2025, Palmer had 22 full-time and nine part-time deputies, more than doubling his 2022 numbers and had increased patrols from nine to 15 towns, including four in Orange County.
The expansion kicked off as soon as Palmer’s term began.

(Valley News / Report For America – Alex Driehaus)
In the first four months of 2023, Palmer spent $219,000 on five new cruisers and another almost $150,000 on other equipment through a combination of reserve funds, loans and grants, the Valley News reported at the time.
“My goal coming into this was to really change the paradigm and to change the way Vermont sheriff departments operate, because I felt there was a huge void in rural law enforcement and that has obviously been very expensive,” Palmer said of the investment.
In two and a half years under Palmer’s leadership, the Windsor County Sheriff’s Department has undergone two audits, both within the first six months of his term, according to reports filed with the Vermont state auditor. Vermont law requires that sheriff departments be audited by an outside accounting firm once every two years.
The first was a transition audit that primarily looked at money handled by Chamberlain, the former sheriff. The second audit concerned finances from Feb. 1 through June 30, 2023.
From Jan. 31 through June 30, 2023, the amount of money included in the Windsor Sheriff’s Department bank account decreased from just over $1 million to about $550,000, according to the reports. At the same time, the value of vehicles and equipment increased from about $70,000 to over $450,000.
The Department is about to kick off another regularly scheduled state-mandated audit, Palmer noted in the Facebook post.
Palmer has signed the paperwork to authorize the regular audit but it has not formally started, he said Friday. The last two audits each took about a month to complete.
For now, Palmer said he is focused on continuing his work as usual.
“If you look at where things were before I took over to now, I think that we’ve done a lot of good and that’s kind of my focus in moving forward.”

Nationwide, more than 1,400 people this year have tested positive for the disease thought eliminated in 2000. Three people, two in Texas and one in New Mexico, have died from measles in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Upstate resident, who was unvaccinated and had not previously had measles, recently returned from an international trip to a country with a measles outbreak, according to the state health department, which did not name the country.

The Department of Public Health also declined to provide the person’s age, sex or the county where they live because of privacy concerns, according to a news release.
The first case this year, reported in July, also came from an unvaccinated Upstate resident who had recently been out of the country. They infected a second person soon after, who was also unvaccinated, according to the public health department.
One person tested positive for measles in 2024 following an international trip. The state had an outbreak of six cases in 2018, but the last case before that was in 1997.
Measles is highly infectious and can be fatal, especially in children. Often, people with measles will notice a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that lasts about a week. The disease can cause pneumonia and brain swelling in severe cases, according to the health department.
The measles vaccine is highly effective, according to the health department. Of the people who have tested positive for the disease across the country this year, 92% were unvaccinated, according to the CDC.
Typically, children receive a first dose of the measles vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and a second between 4 and 6 years.
South Carolina’s rate of vaccination for school-age children has fallen in recent years, from about 96% during the 2020-2021 school year to about 94% in 2024-2025, according to health department data.

The new facility will serve as a hub for the company, consolidating three existing Michigan locations into one state-of-the-art campus, according to a press release from the office of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
It is designed to increase efficiency and collaboration for the company’s approximately 941 Michigan-based employees and provide an opportunity for co-location with employees from its parent company, Hitachi.
The new headquarters will feature both office space and manufacturing capabilities, the press release indicated.
 A boost for local manufacturing

Zeeland’s selection as the new global headquarters is a major endorsement of the area’s economic strategy, said Mayor Kevin Klynstra. The city was chosen over a location in South Carolina, where JR Automation has an existing facility with space to grow.
“We are very  proud to welcome JR Automation to the city of Zeeland. To have them pick our community is an honor. We have been known to be a business-friendly community for many years, and we have given many tax abatements out to industrial and commercial businesses over the years,” Klynstra said. “We hope to have a long and successful relationship with JR Automation.”
Beyond the direct jobs and investment, the project also has a ripple effect on the local economy, he said. The move will free up existing industrial space in nearby Holland, providing room for other growing companies, Klynstra said.
The company aims to create a “sustainable” building which will include solar panels, native prairie landscaping to promote biodiversity and a goal to have its baseline operations powered entirely by renewable energy, the press release indicated.
Klynstra said the headquarters will be a draw for skilled workers and new business, solidifying Zeeland’s role in the global automation industry.
Amanda Murray, vice president of business solutions for Lakeshore Advantage said the local community will benefit as well.

That was the message from Mark P. Gardner, chaplain and volunteer services coordinator at Delaware’s secure juvenile detention facility, during this week’s A Better Discussion hosted by Jane Brady of A Better Delaware. Gardner said the simple act of wearing professional attire is helping residents reduce behavioral issues, build confidence and prepare for a future beyond incarceration.
“We’ve seen how putting on a suit changes the way these young men see themselves,” Gardner said. “One resident told me, ‘I feel like I can talk to the President.’ That kind of confidence can redirect a life.”
Suits as a tool for change
Gardner leads programs such as Mock Trial, where residents argue cases in donated business attire before volunteer jurists, and Monthly Manhood Mondays, where they attend classes in suits, ties and dress shoes instead of state-issued uniforms. Staff report a marked drop in behavioral problems on those days.
“These suits transform the young boys into young men,” Brady said during the discussion. “They make them see themselves differently in the mirror, and that vision carries beyond Ferris.”
But Gardner noted that many residents serve only about six months at Ferris — not long enough to cement lasting change. As recidivism rates climb, he believes something as simple as access to appropriate clothing can ease their transition. “Some of these young men want to take their suits home when they’re released,” he said. “That shows they’re ready to step into a new identity.”
Call for donations
Gardner is urging Delawareans to contribute conservative, professional suits — navy, charcoal, black or brown — along with ties, dress shirts and lace-up shoes. Flashy or novelty clothing is discouraged.
Donations can be arranged by contacting mark.gardener@delaware.gov.
A book on behavior and belief
Gardner, a longtime minister and author, recently published Keep the Change: A Book for Redirecting Behavior in the Lives of Adjudicated Youth. The book builds on his “Behavior Reflects Belief” approach, encouraging young people to align their actions with the values they claim to hold.
“If they can be influenced to do wrong, they can also be influenced to do right,” Gardner said. “A suit may seem small, but it can be the start of that change.”
Brady added that initiatives like Gardner’s reduce the burden on victims, communities and taxpayers. “We don’t prosper when we’re constantly pulling people back from behind the eight ball,” she said. “Programs like this give them the courage to make hard, but right, choices — and that makes Delaware stronger.”

His office criticizes administrative costs and “outside-of-classroom” spending in the report, and recommends diverting that money to boost assistant teacher pay, which averages $22,840 a year in Mississippi. 
While it’s the first time he’s focused on assistant teachers, White, who is weighing a run for Governor, has consistently drawn attention to education spending since he took office in 2018. 
White first drew attention to outside-of-classroom spending in a 2019 report that includes examples such as district office salaries, campus and building maintenance and the production of school informational material. Previous reports from the auditor’s office have similarly encouraged districts to cut spending that doesn’t directly go to the classroom, duplicative or unused equipment and administrative salaries. His predecessor had also criticized Mississippi’s spending on education administration.
Though he has no power over policy or appropriations, White proposed a bill last year that would mandate at least half of the state’s education dollars go toward teacher salaries. White has recently received criticism that some of his reports — including one for which he paid millions to a consultant — are aimed at his gubernatorial aspirations, rather than his job as auditor.
The new report is largely aimed at the Legislature and local school districts, a spokesperson for the auditor said. That’s because state law establishes the minimum salary for assistant teachers, not the Mississippi Department of Education. Districts can add to this base amount.
Advocates and some lawmakers have said for years that teacher assistants often get short shrift even when the Legislature raises pay for teachers.
The Legislature increased the minimum assistant teacher salary from $15,000 a year to $17,000 in 2022, but White is calling on lawmakers to raise the floor again. Raising the state’s average assistant teacher salary to the regional average would mean a $6,000 pay raise — a $67.3 million cost, the report says. 
“Assistant teachers are a vital part of Mississippi classrooms … many Mississippi students will suffer without classroom support from an assistant teacher,” the report reads. “Policymakers can build on Mississippi’s educational momentum by cutting runaway outside-the-classroom spending and reinvesting those dollars directly into classrooms—where they make the biggest difference.”
Assistant teachers in Mississippi are some of the lowest paid professionals in the state, according to data tracked by the Mississippi Department of Employment Security, and their salaries lag behind assistant teachers in almost every other state. Ample research shows that low pay discourages people from becoming teachers and drives them out of the profession. 
Mississippi requires that an assistant teacher be present in every kindergarten, first grade, second grade and third grade classroom. Though their specific duties vary by grade and classroom, they generally help manage students and assist with instruction. 
Mississippi Department of Education data shows that there have been at least 500 vacant assistant teacher positions in the state annually since the 2021-2022 school year. 
The report notes a discrepancy of about $62,000 between average entry-level pay for assistant teachers and entry-level school administrators. 
“I don’t make enough to cover most of my expenses,” said a Cleveland School District assistant teacher, who spoke to Mississippi Today on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing her job. “I live from check to check.”
She supports three kids on an annual salary of $21,000. Cleveland School District does not offer biweekly pay, so her paychecks have to stretch further. The longtime assistant teacher has left other school districts in the Mississippi Delta because they offered annual salaries of less than $20,000.
Now, she’s working on a master’s degree and studying for the Praxis exam, a test that teachers must pass in order to be certified, hoping to make a livable wage.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07000623/IMG_5158-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-08 10:56:18.920629

This week on the Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Rich Davey, who just finished his first year as CEO of Massport. They talk about his long history of ground transportation work, plans to improve air travel, and whether Boston actually could have handled the 2024 Olympics.
The post Blocking and tackling with Massport CEO Rich[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Rich Davey, CEO of Massport







FOR A JOB about planes, Massport CEO Rich Davey still spends a lot of time with his eyes on the road. Not as a driver – the Back Bay resident still famously doesn’t have a car – but because the people flowing in and out of Logan Airport are getting stuck in the same traffic jams and navigating the same MBTA system as the rest of the region.  
On The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Davey about his first year at the helm of Massport, after two years as president of the New York City Transit Authority, part of the sprawling Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  
His move to the MTA in 2022 was a return to active transit management, though for once not in his home state of Massachusetts. That was more of a day-to-day “blocking and tackling” role as the system moved about five million people around its buses and subways every weekday. Now he can operate on a longer timeline, wrestling with traffic to and from the airport, what greener air travel could look like, plus pressures on tourism and travel prompted by the second Trump administration. 
Davey is the only person to serve as MBTA general manager, Massachusetts transportation secretary, and the CEO of Massport. Before leading MassDOT, Davey ran the state’s commuter rail system as general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad. After leaving the MBTA leadership post in October 2014, Davey went into consulting, still with an expertise in transit, and was tapped to head up the unsuccessful bid for the Boston 2024 Olympics.  
It seems like quite a shift to go from overseeing the busiest transit system in the country to figuring out how to keep grumpy Bostonians sane at the baggage claim, but Davey says the role is a combination of easing customer pain points and broader-scale system improvements.  
Between the Silver Line bus system, navigating the rise of ride-share services like Uber and Lyft, and thinking about water transit through the Massport-controlled Port of Boston, Davey can never be too far removed from the flow of buses, trains, cars, and boats around the region. 
Driving to the airport can be a traffic nightmare, so Logan is working on TSA screenings “remote terminals” at offsite parking areas in places Braintree, Framingham, and Back Bay. After being screened and parking, customers could shuttle directly to the gates rather than wind through security at Logan. Interestingly, the closer a person lives to Logan Airport, he said, the more likely they are to take Uber or Lyft to the airport than public transit. 
“Part of what we need to do is offer services that allow folks to get their time back, but without causing the mass traffic,” Davey said. “I’m actually really worried about Waymo and autonomous vehicles in the future.” The technology is already here, he said, and people are taking self-driving cars to airports in San Francisco and Phoenix. “I do worry that could create massive traffic around Logan airport as well, so part of what we’re doing is working with the T to see if there are other opportunities.” 
On the episode, Smith and Davey discuss how to improve the daily experience of getting to and from Logan Airport (6:00), the climate impacts of air travel (19:45), his past in immigration enforcement (24:00), and whether the city’s system could have handled the strain if the Olympics landed in the Bay State (29:20).

""I have some thoughts.""","These weary eyes watched football — all or parts of four games — morning, noon and night Saturday. I have some thoughts. 

Rick Cleveland
First, this: What does it say about college football when you watch game after game for nearly 12 hours, finally sleep, and your dreams are punctuated by TV timeouts?
It says, I believe, there are too dang many.
Other thoughts:
First up was San Jose State-Texas, one of any number of early season games when the visiting team, playing for a huge paycheck, is overmatched. San Jose State surely was. The attraction, of course, was Arch Manning, the young Texas quarterback with so many Mississippi connections. 
Young Manning was coming off his first meaningful college start — at defending national champion Ohio State, no less. That’s an incredibly daunting assignment for anyone, no matter pedigree and ability. Manning’s performance against the Buckeyes was uneven, as his stats showed: 17 of 30 passing for 170 yards, a touchdown and an interception, plus 38 yards rushing on 10 keeps. He showed both promise and at times uncertainty.
Fast forward to Saturday: After a slow start, Manning completed 19 of 30 for 295 yards and four touchdowns with one interception. At one point in the first half, he threw four touchdowns in slightly over five minutes of playing time. He ran for another touchdown, looking forever like his grandfather when he tucked the ball and took off. He missed some throws but hit far more than he missed.
Bottom line: He will only get better and better, as any young quarterback does with experience.

I didn’t even have to switch channels for the next leg of my football marathon: Ole Miss-Kentucky, a hard-fought 30-23 Ole Miss road victory.
Several takeaways:
• Similarly to Manning, Rebels quarterback Austin Simmons showed both promise and plenty room for improvement. Two interceptions helped dig the Rebels into a 10-0 hole on the road. But Simmons, displaying much poise for a 19-year-old, then helped them dig out of it, finishing 13 for 24 with the two interceptions and no touchdowns. Expect him to steadily improve.
• Meanwhile, running back Kewan Lacy, a sophomore transfer from Missouri, looks like the real deal. The Dallas native showed vision, speed and power in running for 138 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries.
• My biggest concern for Ole Miss was who was going to replace defensive tackle Walter Nolan, the NFL first rounder who was such a disruptive presence last season. Zxavian Harris, the Canton native and former Germantown standout, appears to be that dude. He was everywhere for the Rebels Saturday, a 6-foot-8, 330-pound force. His fourth quarter sack was one of the game’s biggest plays.
• Kudos also to backup quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, a transfer from Division II Ferris State, who filled in admirably and then some after Simmons suffered a fourth quarter injury. Playing before more partisans than he probably ever did in a full season at Ferris State, Chambliss led the Rebs to a game-clinching field goal on fourth quarter drive. His performance in the clutch was huge.
Don’t know what it is about Kentucky, but the Wildcats seem to play their best against Ole Miss. Bottom line: The 2025 Rebels did what the ’24 Rebels couldn’t, which is survive Kentucky.

Two TVs were necessitated to watch the second half of Ole Miss-Kentucky and the first half of Jackson State-Southern Miss, just the fourth time in history the two Mississippi schools have played one another. The Golden Eagles’ final winning margin, 38-20, is no indication whatsoever of how competitive this game was. Jackson State competed on even terms for most of the contest. T.C. Taylor’s Tigers appear a team that will once again dominate the SWAC and would be competitive in the Sun Belt. 
And Southern Miss, for the second straight week, appeared much improved in its first season under Charles Huff. Transfers from Huff’s Sun Belt champion Marshall team of a year ago were largely responsible for USM’s hard-won victory. Most notably, quarterback Braylon Braxton gives the Eagles a winner at the most important position on the field. Braxton threw for 214 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, and he ran for 20 more yards. He will give the Eagles a fighting chance to win every remaining game on the schedule. On the flip side, USM could lose to any team left on its schedule. 
Jackson State battled the Eagles evenly on both sides of the line of scrimmage. Southern Miss was plus-two in turnovers — and blocked a kick for a touchdown — and that was the difference.
A crowd of more than 32,000, fairly evenly divided, attended a well-played game that, clearly, should happen more often.

We save the best for last: Mississippi State’s scintillating 24-20 victory over No. 12 Arizona State. We must wait until later in the season to know whether Arizona State, a playoff team a year ago, is as good as projected. This we do know: Jeff Lebby’s Bulldogs are a whole lot better than almost everyone thought they would be. State, winner of just two games in 2024, will be favored to be 4-0 headed into a Sept. 27 home game with Tennessee.
The Bulldogs had looked much improved a week earlier in a 34-17 road victory over Southern Miss. They proved it a week later, taking a 17-0 lead against the Sun Devils and then fighting off a furious second half rally.
Lebby dipped heavily into the transfer portal and spent millions of NIL dollars to fix what was clearly broken. All indications are that he spent wisely. It helps immensely that Blake Shapen, a terrific, resourceful player, is back and healthy at quarterback. State would not have been 2-10 last year if Shapen had remained fit throughout.
The Bulldogs benefitted immensely from a raucous, cowbell-clanging crowd that had Arizona State unnerved from the get-go. 
“Awesome environment,” ASU coach Kenny Dillingham said afterward. “They were loud, really loud, but that’s what college football is supposed to be.”
Dillingham’s team had dominated the second half, taking its first and only lead, 20-17, on a chip shot field goal with 98 seconds remaining.
State needed only 68 of those ticks to respond on Shapen’s 58-yard touchdown strike to Brenen Thompson. Given the situation, it seemed hard to comprehend the Devils did not have a safety playing deep in the middle of the field on the third and nine play. But they didn’t, and they paid dearly.
Thus, it seemed the Bulldogs and their 50,000-plus fans experienced an emotional release of the frustrations of the death of a coaching legend and two long seasons of subsequent futility in a goalpost-dismantling postgame celebration. 
Yes, and a long, but eventful day in Mississippi football was done.

It wasn’t on TV, but Delta State’s 41-9 victory over North Greenville (S.C.) University deserves mention. That’s because, with the victory, Delta State coach Todd Cooley becomes the winningest coach in DSU’s 95 years of football. Cooley, the 19th coach in DSU history, has won 77 games and lost 46 as coach of the Statesmen. He passes the late Horace McCool, for whom the DSU football stadium is named, who was 76-58 over 13 seasons.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/07204844/AP25250127140308.jpg,,,2025-09-08 10:56:18.920629

About two dozen firefighters trained in wilderness strategies are scouting the steep country for natural barriers.
The post Wilderness crews work western Wyoming’s Dollar Lake Fire as it approaches Squaretop appeared first on WyoFile .","About two dozen wilderness firefighters are shuttling regularly across lower Green River Lake to help corral the Dollar Lake Fire as it burns through steep country toward Squaretop Mountain.
Two teams specializing in wilderness fire strategy assembled Sunday to boat and hike into the popular recreation area on the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Their deployment marks a new front on the blaze that’s covered 19,087 acres since it was discovered Aug. 21 along a dirt road heavily used for car and van camping.
Firefighters have not determined the cause of the blaze, according to the Forest Service.
“Extracting folks out of there, if something were to happen, would be extremely difficult.” Karsten Milek
Incident Commander Richard Hayner and his Wyoming Team 2 are wary about the rugged wilderness country and how difficult it would be to evacuate an injured firefighter, Karsten Milek, a BLM employee on the team said.
“It’s just a really tough, challenging area,” Milek said, “and medically extracting folks out of there, if something were to happen, would be extremely difficult.”
From the trailhead at the outlet of lower Green River Lake, the fire has burned about six miles to the south along the western side of the valley leading to Squaretop. The area, closed by the Forest Service because of the blaze, is heavily used by hikers, paddlers, hunters, climbers and trail riders.
The closure, which Forest Supervisor Chad Hudson expanded on Thursday, includes the Highline Trail portion of the Continental Divide Trail between the Clark Creek Trail and Union Pass Road. Altogether, 485 firefighters are working on the Dollar Lake Fire, which was 32% contained Sunday morning.
Near the fire’s point of origin at Dollar Lake, officials have relaxed evacuation notices for the Kendall community and are shoring up protection there and at other developed sites.
Wilderness specialists
The Wilderness squads, known as the Idaho Central and King’s Peak fire modules, enlist up to a dozen firefighters trained to assess and fight in rugged, remote areas. They are ensconced at a spike camp at the Green River Lakes Campground.
“They do a lot of the input for fire progression and the studies of terrain and the topography and how fire can move within those challenging areas,” said Milek, the team’s planning operations section chief who works with the BLM’s High Plains District in Wyoming. The crews can fight fire like any other hand crew, “but they do specialize on kind of the scientific end,” he said.
Rocky ground, cliffs, avalanche paths, landslides and talus slopes may provide fire breaks on the path toward Squaretop. The Squaretop front is in the Forest’s roadless Bridger Wilderness at the north end of the Wind River Range, where motors, wheels, chainsaws and other mechanized tools are prohibited.

The wilderness crews are looking for places they could “tie those natural barriers in together with the least exposure to firefighters,” Milek said. “There is also quite a bit of water in the bottom of the drainages that are also going to be natural barriers,” he said.
The crews have not asked for permission to use chainsaws, he said.
“The actions that we’re taking are based on firefighter safety and the highest probability of success with the really rugged terrain,” Milek said. “We have to take [rescue] into consideration and who we can put in and what kind of risk we’re exposing them to.”
Stan Decker Cannon said Sunday he is grateful firefighters saved what’s left of his family’s ranch at the outlet of Green River Lakes. The Forest Service now owns the historic house that was built in the 1950s.
His grandfather, Stan Decker, first saw Squaretop 100 years ago on a hunting trip with Harold Fabian. Fabian was John D. Rockefeller’s representative in the secret purchase of Jackson Hole land that would become part of Grand Teton National Park.
Decker bought what became the GP Bar Ranch (GP for Gannett Peak) during the Great Depression and turned it into a small, exclusive retreat for well-heeled international notables. A lake high above the ranch and now almost surrounded by fire was named Valaite (Va-late) after Stan Cannon’s grandmother.
“I was told the fire took two runs at Grandad’s house that crews had to beat back,” Cannon wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “Thank you to all the firefighters on the Dollar Lake Fire who saved his house.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Jennifer-Ruth Green has stepped down as Indiana’s Secretary of Public Safety, Gov. Mike Braun announced Saturday, marking the first major shakeup in his cabinet since taking office.
Braun said Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott will take on an expanded role as the new secretary of public safety.
“I am pleased to announce that Anthony Scott, Superintendent of the Indiana State Police, has accepted the role of Secretary of Public Safety,” Braun said in a statement posted on X. “He will continue his strong and effective leadership of the Indiana State Police as Superintendent. Hoosiers will be safe with Anthony and the State Police setting the tone for all state government public safety agencies.”
The move came less than a year after Green joined Braun’s cabinet — and opened the door for a second congressional bid.
“She was a part of a transformative time in Indiana’s history and we wish her the best of luck on her next endeavor,” he said. The governor added that he would announce “additional personnel updates and efficiencies in the Office of Public Safety at the beginning of the week.”
On Sunday, Green posted her own statement on X.
“Many thanks to Governor Braun for the honor of serving as Indiana’s inaugural Secretary of Public Safety. I’m honored to have worked alongside so many great leaders around the state,” she said. “Secretary Scott will do an amazing job in this position, and I look forward to watching his successes. I’m off to military duty — always a privilege to wear the uniform, and I’m excited for the future.”
The military service Green referenced is not a deployment but routine National Guard duty, expected to last only a week or two.

Neither Green nor the governor’s office provided further details about her future plans, however.
Even so, Green has been a rising figure in state Republican politics since her 2022 run for U.S. Congress in Indiana’s 1st District, where she mounted a competitive challenge to Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. 
Despite losing that race, Green came within 5 percentage points in a traditionally Democratic stronghold.
Tim Edson, who served as Green’s consultant on her 2022 congressional race, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Green “is seriously weighing another run for Congress in northwest Indiana and Republican leaders in Indiana and nationally are encouraging her to enter the race.”
Republicans are currently weighing mid-cycle redistricting, aiming to grow the number of GOP-held seats in Congress. The 1st District, along with Marion County’s 7th District, are both held by Democrats.
Green, a combat veteran and cybersecurity expert, had been appointed to the post in December as part of Braun’s incoming administration. At the time, Braun said her “military and cybersecurity background made her uniquely qualified to lead Indiana’s public safety agencies.”
Green previously commanded the 122nd Cyber Operations Flight in Fort Wayne and deployed to Baghdad with the Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq. A U.S. Air Force Academy graduate, she is an FAA-certified pilot and a former Air Force Special Agent. She also served as Deputy Commander of the 11th Operations Group at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.
Upon being named secretary, Green pledged to “bring a strategic, comprehensive approach to public safety that protects Hoosier families and supports our first responders.”
Scott, who has led the Indiana State Police since earlier this year, will now oversee the state’s entire public safety apparatus while remaining in charge of the department.

Nearly 100 special interest groups spent more than $820,000 last year to send California legislators to far-off places such as Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Israel, writes CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman. 
About three-quarters of the Legislature, or 92 Democratic and Republican lawmakers, were recipients of free trips, according to financial disclosure reports. Similar to years past, in 2022 and 2023 specifically, the largest sponsor of travel last year was the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy. 
The nonprofit paid nearly $260,000 to take more than 40 lawmakers on domestic and international trips. The foundation is an unusual umbrella group that includes corporations, oil companies, environmental groups and others. Its international trips, known as “study tours,” allow representatives from these special interest groups to mingle with lawmakers. 
In March, a handful of legislators attended a trip to the U.K. focused on climate change, while another trip in November explored electric vehicles and high-speed rail systems in Taiwan and Vietnam.
The second-largest sponsor of trips was the Independent Voter Project. Focusing on voter education of public policy issues, the organization spent more than $100,000 on two trips for lawmakers: An annual trip to Maui attended by 17 legislators, and another to Mexico with six lawmakers called the “Make it with Mexico Cross Border Conference.”
The Jewish Community Relations Council and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles paid nearly $82,000 in total for a trip to Israel last February. Seven Democratic lawmakers were in attendance, including the two co-chairpeople of the Legislative Jewish Caucus.
Sen. Scott Wiener, one of the co-chairs, said he went on the trip because it was “important to see with my own eyes the horrors of the October 7th terror attack.” The San Francisco Democrat added that he sometimes thinks the Israeli Prime Minister and his administration are Iranian assets because “they’re creating more danger for Israel, in addition to the horrors in Gaza.”

Rural hospital braces for closure as feds affirm decision


Glenn Medical Center in Willows on June 13, 2025. Photo by Chris Kaufman for CalMatters




A reinterpretation of a federal rule has stripped a rural hospital in Glenn County of its “critical access” designation, leading to its likely closure in October, reports CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
For more than two decades, Glenn Medical Center has been considered a critical access hospital, which is a status for hospitals that are located at least 35 miles from the next closest hospital when traveling by main roads. 
This classification has allowed the center to receive increased federal reimbursement. But in April, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revoked the center of this status, saying that it is only 32 miles away from the next closest hospital.
For months Glenn Medical Center has been making its case to the federal health agency to reverse its decision, arguing that the route most people take measures 35.7 miles. But the agency has since remained firm.
Without critical access status, the hospital, about 90 minutes north of Sacramento, will be left with a budget gap it cannot fill. Its closure means Glenn County will lose its only hospital, 150 health workers will be out of a job, and local residents and ambulances will have to travel at least 40 minutes for emergency care.

Norwalk repeals homeless shelter ban

The city of Norwalk in L.A. County is reversing its ban on homeless shelters following a legal settlement it reached Friday with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
Last fall, the Southern California city temporarily banned emergency shelters and supportive housing, arguing that shelters and homeless housing could have “detrimental effects” on the community. Calling Norwalk’s actions at the time “immoral,” Newsom and the California Attorney General sued the city in November.
A judge in L.A. Superior Court still must approve the settlement, and if the deal goes through, Norwalk will also be required to put $250,000 toward developing new affordable housing in the city.

Speaking of housing development: An influential California construction union has agreed to drop its opposition to a contested housing bill, after striking a deal with the bill’s author, Sen. Wiener. 
The bill would make it easier to build taller and denser housing near major transit stations (a priority for Wiener), and would now include a provision that would require some housing projects that make use of the bill to hire union workers. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.

The road to becoming a nurse in California has been paved with roadblocks, sharp turns and bottlenecks. Where that education is offered has a lot to do with it.
As someone who has lived every long mile and continued to drive forward, I believe the solution lies in expanding the ability for California’s community colleges to offer bachelor of science degrees in nursing. 
Community colleges are where many nurses start. They should be where we have the chance to finish as we shift into our careers.
Assembly Bill 1400, if passed, would enable some of California’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees in nursing programs. Students could pursue their education in their communities, at a cost they could afford. 
Before I earned my nursing license, I worked 15 years as a unit secretary in a busy hospital emergency department. I dreamed of becoming one of the nurses I watched delivering care.
I needed a program that was affordable, close to home and flexible enough so I could keep earning a living while studying. I chose Cerritos College and pursued an associate’s degree in nursing, since that program is known for rigorous training and a high success rate — including my cohort, who all passed the licensing exam.
Despite my dedication and on-the-job experience, I knew I wouldn’t qualify for the nursing position I sought without a bachelor’s degree. But I faced a frustrating reality: I had to leave Cerritos College and take on the expense of a four-year university.
I completed my bachelor’s at National University, which was a great opportunity, but it came with a high price tag and student loans. I managed the loans and the commute, but for many Californians who already work or have a family, a bachelor’s program at a community college would be life-changing.
AB 1400 is ultimately about equitable access and building a health care workforce that reflects California’s diverse communities. And it opens doors to health care careers that are desperately needed. Nearly 60% of California’s population lives in an area with a nursing shortage. To meet California’s projected need of 65,000 more full-time nurses by 2037, we need more than one solution. 
Today I work as an emergency room nurse for the trauma center where I started my career. I also pay it forward as a success coach for nursing students at Cerritos College. 
I’ve mentored many students who, like me, are the first in their families to enter a health care profession. I see their passion, their drive and, unfortunately, their fear of the next step. The tuition cost of a bachelor’s nursing program is tens of thousands of dollars, putting it out of reach for many.
We need to meet students where they are by adapting to their work, family and financial situations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/100923_USF-Nursing-Program_AA_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

California GOP split on centering him in redistricting campaign,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/california-gop-proposition-50-campaign/,Gov. Gavin Newsom wants the campaign for Proposition 50 to be a battle between him and President Donald Trump. Republicans say they need to win over voters another way.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom wants the campaign for Proposition 50 to be a battle between him and President Donald Trump. Republicans say they need to win over voters another way. 


Since he first floated the idea on a podcast this summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been the face of a plan to redraw California’s congressional lines to favor Democrats.
Now, as the state hurtles toward a Nov. 4 special election in which voters will decide whether to adopt a new gerrymandered map, opponents are grappling with how much to center Newsom in their campaign to defeat the proposal.
At the California Republican Party convention in Garden Grove this past weekend — which aimed to mobilize conservatives against Newsom’s measure, known as Proposition 50 — the governor was a curiously negligible presence.
In strategy sessions and trainings, GOP leaders largely looked beyond Newsom, whose slick style, celebrity stature and unabashedly liberal politics have for years offered California Republicans a delicious foil. Even the merchandise tables were missing their usual fare depicting the governor as a dictator with a Hitler mustache.
“I don’t think this is about Gavin Newsom. This is what he wants to do, but this is about Californians,” Corrin Rankin, the party chair, told reporters. She said the party will run a get-out-the-vote operation educating Republicans about how the new map would effectively take away their right to choose who represents them.
“We’re going to make sure that fine print is in bold letters and people see what exactly they’re voting for and that they’re not fooled again by the Democratic Party,” Rankin said.
Make it about the map
During a presentation Saturday afternoon about legal challenges to the redistricting gambit, Orange County Republican Party Chair Will O’Neill told attendees their most effective talking point to defeat Proposition 50 is to simply show voters the new map.
Newsom’s plan would toss out congressional districts drawn by an independent citizen commission in 2021 and adopt lines that flip the partisan lean of five Republican-held seats while shoring up the Democratic registration advantage in five more swing districts. The GOP could be left with as few as four of California’s 52 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.

O’Neill told delegates to find the most “absurd” changes in their communities and post them on social media. He highlighted a proposed district around Lake Tahoe that’s been compared to an elephant head, because of a trunk-shaped swath that dips into the heavily Democratic suburbs of Sacramento, and a line drawn down the middle of a residential street in Mission Viejo, splitting houses on either side into different seats.
To win, O’Neill said in an interview, Republicans have to broaden the election to be about the detrimental impacts of Proposition 50 and reach the vast majority of Californians who are not living in hyperpartisan online environments. Only 25% of voters in the state are registered Republican, compared to 45% who are registered Democratic and 22% who have no party preference.
“Whether the person likes Donald Trump or Gavin Newsom isn’t really the issue,” O’Neill said. “If this is a straight Republican vs. Democrat election, we lose.”
There’s no escaping Newsom
For many voters, Proposition 50 will be a choice between Newsom and Trump. That’s exactly how Newsom himself has framed it.
The governor began talking about redistricting in July, after Trump pressured Texas Republicans to call a special session to redraw the state’s congressional map and bolster the GOP’s narrow control of the House. The new lines in Texas will likely flip five Democratic seats to Republicans.
Newsom has argued that California’s retaliation was necessary to save democracy — preserving Democrats’ chances of winning back the House in the 2026 midterms and preventing Trump from dragging the United States into authoritarianism.
The president, who remains deeply unpopular in California, is everywhere in Newsom’s campaign for Proposition 50, which he has dubbed the “Election Rigging Response Act.” It echoes the governor’s successful strategy for defeating a recall attempt in 2021.
But Newsom is everywhere as well. He stars prominently in one of the first ads for the campaign, which features footage from a rally he held in Los Angeles last month, where he urges voters to “stand up for our democracy.”
And some opponents are putting Newsom at the forefront of their pitch to voters.

Former California GOP Chair Jessica Millan Patterson is leading one of the campaigns against the measure, which has taken the name No On 50 – Stop Newsom’s Power Grab. She said in an interview that Newsom “turns out Republicans,” who are frustrated by their belief that he has treated his governorship like merely a stepping stone to the White House.
It makes Newsom a potent symbol for what Patterson called “the corruption and those backroom deals when Sacramento politicians have that type of power” to draw their own districts, which in this case would leave vast swaths of conservative Californians without representation in Washington, D.C. She slammed the governor for wearing gerrymandering “like a badge of honor.”
“It’s a sense of justice. I think people get really fired up about it,” Patterson said. “We’re going to make sure the rest of the country sees that even Californians aren’t falling for his lame vanity project here.”
A split campaign strategy
Around the convention, Assemblymember David Tangipa was the rare voice making Proposition 50 about Newsom. He urged attendees to ask everyone they know one question: Does Gavin Newsom deserve more power?
Tangipa, a Fresno Republican, said he expected that question to carry weight even in heavily Democratic California, because enough people have woken up to the problems created by the state’s liberal policies. Voters, he noted, overwhelmingly approved a tough-on-crime measure last year that Newsom fiercely opposed.
“He’s not running a redistricting campaign. He’s running an anti-Trump campaign,” Tangipa said. “They love that we want to get into facts and data and everything else and they’re getting into emotion.”
Not everyone is so convinced. Olivia Valentine, president of the Hawthorne Lawndale Gardena Republican Assembly, was in search of door signs and other materials she could use to canvass against Proposition 50. She said she would refrain from bashing Newsom because she didn’t want voters to think she was a “partisan hack.”
“I don’t want that response. I want them to understand why it’s going to be bad for everybody,” Valentine said. “Everyone should be concerned that their vote is being taken away. That’s scary.”

The conundrum over how much to involve Newsom — who Republicans seem uniformly convinced is using the redistricting fight to boost his prospects in an expected 2028 presidential run — is visible everywhere in the campaign.
Charles Munger, Jr., a longtime California GOP megadonor who poured millions into the ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission, is running his own operation aimed at liberal-leaning voters. The ads have a good government message about the inherent corruption of politicians drawing their own districts, eschewing mention of Newsom and Trump altogether.
Republicans also hope that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the party’s last statewide officeholder and another champion of the commission, will rally independents against Proposition 50. Schwarzenegger has spoken out against the measure, posting himself online in a “terminate gerrymandering” T-shirt, but he has not announced a formal role  in the campaign. 
The motivating factor: fairness
On Saturday morning, California GOP delegates from the north state, a deeply conservative area that would be chopped up and redistributed into Democratic-leaning districts under the new congressional map, packed into a small hotel ballroom.
Most are currently represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Chico Republican, whose chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, visited the session to discuss the bifurcated strategy for defeating Proposition 50.
“What motivates our center-right is not the mealy-mouthed stuff that’s going to motivate our friends on the left,” he said. “So you need to speak to them differently and you need to motivate them in a different way.”
Then Johanna Lassaga, chair of the Yuba County Republican Central Committee, stepped to the front to show off a campaign sign she had made: black and yellow, featuring simple language (“No on 50: Defend Fair Elections”) with no mention of Newsom.

She had thousands available for delegates to buy and distribute around their communities. She asked if anyone had property along the highway where they would be willing to hang banners that could be seen by drivers — even liberals who might be drawn to the intentionally nonpartisan message.
In an interview, Lassaga said she is deeply worried about losing a member of Congress who understands her rural community. Her family farms rice and raises cattle, and she doesn’t think a Democratic representative from a more urban area would fight for them to get water.
But Lassaga said she is trying to lift people up by focusing on what they can do to win. She is trusting in the “power of seven” — encouraging everyone to tell seven people they know to vote against Proposition 50 and then have them pass on the word to seven more people. She recently talked to the salespeople at the dealership where her husband bought a new car.
“We can’t sit and wallow in our self-pity,” she said. “The whole thing is a multilevel marketing scheme with no product.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090625-CA-GOP-OC-JAH-CM-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

A new bill would give officials more tools to identify and combat sexual abuse and educate students to better identify the most common signs of grooming behavior.


A beloved teacher arrested for soliciting a minor. A coach convicted of sexual abuse. A school district hit with a multi-million-dollar jury verdict for failing to protect students. 
The steady drumbeat of stories in recent years about educator sexual abuse in K-12 school districts across California shows the scope of misconduct is much wider than previously known. Yet the stories only hint at how common sexual harassment and grooming behavior has become in schools, with the best available data from the U.S. Education Department suggesting that 1 in 10 children is targeted for grooming at some point in their K-12 education.  
A new bill, which is poised to pass the Legislature in the coming days, would give local and state officials more tools to identify and combat sexual abuse, and educate students to better identify the most common signs of grooming behavior. Senate Bill 848, or “Safe Learning Environments Act,” was authored by Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democrat from Alhambra, in response to an investigative report in Business Insider, The Predators’ Playground. The 2023 story documented decades of sexual misconduct involving nearly two dozen different educators, ranging from lewd remarks about students’ bodies during class to statutory rape, at a single California school, Rosemead High, which is in Pérez’s district. 
Since the article was published, at least five civil lawsuits have been filed by former Rosemead students, while the state attorney general’s Bureau of Children’s Justice opened a rare investigation into the handling of educator sexual misconduct claims, which is ongoing.
“California lacks a comprehensive standardized approach to preventing abuse in K-12 schools,”  Pérez told fellow lawmakers in urging their support. “Several high profile cases continue to highlight systemic failures and underscore an urgent need for stronger preventative measures to protect children.” 
In an interview with CalMatters, Pérez said she could personally relate to the Rosemead story. When she was in high school, a male staffer some 20 years her senior took an interest in her, asking her questions about sex and boys her age. Then one day, when she returned to campus soon after graduating, he stopped her to ask if she’d turned 18 and if he could take her to dinner. That’s when, Pérez said, it dawned on her that he’d been grooming her for a sexual relationship.

“I didn’t tell my parents or anything, but I talked about it with my friends,” she recalled. “And I remember talking about it, even at 17. That’s when my friends started sharing their own stories.” 
Law would mandate a database of employee misconduct
If it becomes law, Pérez’s bill would create a database of employee misconduct that district administrators must use to background prospective job candidates, require school district officials to report and track “egregious” instances of employee misconduct, mandate training for both educators and students on how to combat and recognize the signs of grooming, and require school districts to implement new written policies defining professional boundaries. It would also apply stricter prior employment check requirements for non-teachers, such as coaches, janitors and bus drivers, update the legal definition of “grooming” to include electronic communications and extend mandated reporter requirements to all employees. 
Much of the policy changes in the bill are drawn from a January report produced by the state-funded Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team. The report studied the financial impact of a wave of lawsuits made possible through a landmark 2019 law that temporarily dropped the statute of limitations for victims of childhood sexual abuse to file civil claims against school districts for failing to protect them. Many of the resulting jury verdicts and settlements have been in the tens of millions of dollars, with some much higher.
As CalMatters previously reported, insurance premiums have skyrocketed for school districts, pushing some to the brink of financial insolvency. Estimates for the total value of claims statewide are around $3 billion, with many cases ongoing.
Pérez said this grim reality played a key role in her decision to draft the bill. “There are now dollars and cents being assigned to these cases,” she said. “It’s really opened up this conversation about what can we do to better prevent this abuse from happening.”
Billie-Jo Grant, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona and a leading researcher in educator sexual misconduct, said the majority of grooming cases in schools go unreported. In many cases, a student is ashamed or feels complicit in the behavior, Grant said, while employees routinely fail to report suspicious behavior for fear of tarnishing a colleague’s reputation.
Because of a lack of federal data, Grant has tracked teacher arrests using published news clips, which show that more than 3,000 educators nationwide have been arrested since 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct involving students. California’s Commission on Teacher Credentialing, meanwhile, has opened more than 1,300 investigations of teacher sexual misconduct over the same time period – a figure that does not include cases which are never referred to the state by school district officials. 
Grant, who frequently serves as an expert witness in criminal sexual abuse cases, described  Pérez’s bill as a great start toward creating more complete data on the frequency of abuse. She stressed, however, that relying on school officials to determine whether misconduct allegations are “substantiated” will lead to underreporting.
“I think what’s left out is all of the times where they simply don’t do an investigation, look at a complaint at face value, and ask the teacher if they’d resign. And that’s the end of the story,” Grant said. “The problem is there is no accountability for school administrators. Our system relies on them doing thorough investigations.” 
Law would mandate a database of employee misconduct
A primary element of Pérez’s bill addresses “pass the trash,” a well-documented process in which teachers accused of sexual misconduct quietly resign, only to be hired elsewhere and re-offend. Research funded by the U.S. Department of Justice shows that an educator will on average pass through three different school districts before they are ultimately stopped. Many of these teachers are able to be rehired because of confidential separation agreements, in which school officials agree to not disclose allegations of misconduct to would-be employers in exchange for the educator’s resignation.
That’s what happened earlier this year with David Pitts, a former Rosemead High choir teacher who was placed on administrative leave at a nearby school after he was named in Business Insider’s reporting. A school district investigation of Pitts’ behavior nearly led to an administrative hearing at the state level — a final step that most cases never reach because the teacher has quietly resigned — before Pitts settled. Under the terms of his settlement agreement, Pitts will remain on the payroll until 2026. District officials agreed that if they receive any reference check from a potential employer, they would respond only by “providing Employee’s dates of employment and assignments, and indicating that Employee retired from the District.” Both Pitts and the district’s head of human resources declined to comment.
Pérez invited Cindy Lam, a Rosemead alum who said she was groomed by Pitts when she served as his student piano accompanist in 2001, to testify in Sacramento in support of her bill.  
“By the time he initiated sex with me, I was putty in his hands. And by the time I realized I had been groomed, I was completely isolated and psychologically destroyed,” Lam said. “A law like SB 848 would have adequately educated me about grooming behaviors. I would have known that these interactions were inappropriate and reported them.”
Opposition to the bill, which has bipartisan support, is focused on due process concerns raised by employee unions that have historically opposed similar attempts to strengthen pass the trash laws in California. The California Teachers Association — the state’s largest teacher’s union, which opposed similar legislation in 2012 and again in 2018, — notably does not oppose the bill. The California Federation of Teachers and California State Employees Association, however, which together represent both teachers and the non-credentialed educators who would be included in the disciplinary database that Pérez’s bill would create, recently opposed it. Both unions cited concerns over due process as the primary reason.
“We need to ensure a policy that captures individuals that are unfit to work in education while making sure innocent and unfairly charged employees have fair access to justice,” said California Federation of Teachers legislative director Tristan Brown. “We are committed to working with the senator to make that a reality.”
Numerous other states already rely on similar hiring databases, however, which regulators have cited as key tools in keeping students safe. California is one of just 16 states that lack a comprehensive pass the trash law, a 2022 report published by the Department of Education found.
Back in the Rosemead community, many have welcomed Pérez’s bill as a needed change in a community where boundaries between teachers and students have frequently been blurred. Kristy Rowe, a Rosemead alum who graduated before Lam, testified in support of Pérez’s bill as well. 
Rowe said she had a sexual relationship with Paul Arevalo, a business teacher known on campus for inviting cheerleaders to sit on his lap in between classes. Not long after Rowe met him, Arevalo was investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for allegedly offering to buy another female student condoms and sending her sexually explicit messages during class, disciplinary documents show. Arevalo went on to marry a former student and, after transferring to a nearby school in the district, was placed on leave in 2017 when administrators found he’d sexually harassed another student, records show. Arevalo declined to comment.
“Comprehensive legal reform is urgently needed to center the voices of potential victims, to mandate specialized training for educational personnel, and to ensure that future harm is avoided,” Rowe told lawmakers. “Addressing these gaps is not only a matter of justice, it is a moral imperative to protect children, empower survivors, and create a society where such abuse is neither tolerated nor hidden.”

(Photo by Robin Bravender / States Newsroom)New Mexico Democratic U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján joined more than 40 Senate Democrats in calling upon U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to make clear that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients have protection from deportation.
DACA is a status conferred through a 2012 federal law that affords immigrants who were brought to the United States as children protection, also known as “dreamers,” from being deported for renewable two-year periods.
According to a news release, the Sept. 3 letter to Noem stems from a statement made by DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in which she said, “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation.”
The senators’ letter notes that, “DACA was created to provide protections from immigration enforcement for certain noncitizens brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers, who undergo strict background checks and meet specific educational or work requirements. In contrast to Ms. McLaughlin’s puzzling statement, public DHS guidance makes clear that DACA holders are ‘not considered to be unlawfully present’ in the United States and that ‘[a]n individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.’”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico recently sued Noem and other federal and local officials over the arrest and “indefinite” detention of a DACA recipient in a state immigrant detention facility.
The letter urges Noem to correct McLaughlin’s statement “to accurately reflect DACA and ensure that DHS recognizes and abides by the protections of DACA moving forward.”
Heinrich, Luján and other Senate Democrats also sent a letter earlier this year to the Trump administration pushing for it to reopen applications for DACA status, following a court ruling that paved the way for them to resume. In July, Heinrich introduced legislation to protect DACA recipients’ private information.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DREAMERS-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/glenn-county-hospital-medicaid-lamalfa-oz-closure/,Glenn Medical Center's ‘heartbreaking’ closure will put 150 people out of work and send rural patients to neighboring counties for care.,"In summary
Glenn Medical Center’s ‘heartbreaking’ closure will put 150 people out of work and send rural patients to neighboring counties for care. 


Absent a Hail Mary, Glenn County’s only hospital is set to close its doors in October.
Tucked between two national forests, the rural county is home to 28,000 people. Without a local emergency room, they’ll instead have to travel at least 40 minutes to a neighboring county for critical care. One hundred and fifty health workers will lose their jobs; they’re already resigning to seek work elsewhere. 
The planned closure of Glenn Medical Center follows a decision by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to strip the hospital’s federal “critical access” designation, a status that has provided Glenn Medical increased reimbursement and regulatory flexibility. Without that status, the hospital’s $28 million in net annual revenue will take a hit of about 40% — a gap too large to fill any other way than closing the hospital, said Lauren Still, the hospital’s chief executive.
“It’s heartbreaking that we come to this. I am still kind of praying for that 11th hour miracle to come through,” Still said. “But honestly, we just have to be realistic, and this is the hand we’ve been dealt.”
Over the last several months Still and her team have been attempting to make their case with the federal health agency, even flying to Washington D.C in July in an attempt to lobby their case. 
At the crux of the issue is a federal rule, newly reinterpreted, that requires critical access hospitals to be at least 35 miles from the next closest hospital when traveling by main roads. Officials at CMS now say that the next closest hospital, Colusa Medical Center, is only 32 miles away — 3 miles short of the required distance. 
Glenn Medical Center and county health officials argue that most people and ambulances take a different route, I-5 to Highway 20. That route is 35.7 miles, a distance that would qualify. 
“We really felt that by getting all of our stories out there … showing all of the different people that would be impacted by this decision, we really thought that would be enough information for them [CMS] to consider the human and practical considerations of their decision,” Still said. “Unfortunately, the only thing that matters is how they’re measuring the distance on the roads.”

The feds first notified Glenn Medical in April that a recertification review found the hospital was not eligible for the critical access program. Hospital officials clung to hope that an appeal and communication with the agency would clarify the situation. But in a letter dated Aug. 13, the agency told the hospital it was standing by its original decision. 
“After reviewing the hospital’s additional information, CMS found that the hospital continues to not meet the distance requirement,” the letter reads.
The locations of Glenn Medical Center and its neighbor a county over have not changed since Glenn Medical first became eligible for the critical access program in 2001. CalMatters asked the federal agency why it was seeking to revoke the hospital’s designation now after more than two decades of eligibility at the same distance. The agency did not directly answer the question, but in an email simply reiterated the requirements to qualify for the program. 
CMS said Glenn Medical Center could convert to another provider type in order to continue participating in the Medicare program. But Still said no other Medicare reimbursement model would pay the hospital at a financially sustainable rate. Under the critical access program, the federal government pays hospitals 101% of their costs for inpatient and outpatient services provided to Medicare patients.
U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Richvale Republican who represents Glenn County, said he continues to have conversations with Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator at CMS. He said they last spoke last week.
“We’re not giving up by any stretch, we’re going to pull out all the stops,” LaMalfa said. “We had a really good conversation with Dr. Oz and are looking for a way to make it work because the closure is not acceptable. It’s a technical issue that we oughta find a way to work through.”

LaMalfa said he is considering introducing a bill that could update the mileage requirement or give CMS more discretion when evaluating rural hospitals. But it’s unclear that something could get done before October. 
Glenn Medical Center and its staff cannot wait for much longer. The hospital announced it would keep its clinics open, but inpatient services will cease Oct. 21. Still said that’s when she expects to no longer have enough staff to be able to operate. 
“We had to start talking to staff and telling staff that, “Hey, we don’t have a future here. There’s no viable path forward for us without that critical access designation,’” Still said. “At that point, we started getting staff resignations.”
With the announced closure, most Glenn County residents will have to seek emergency services either at the hospital in Colusa County or further away at Butte County’s Enloe Medical Center, a larger Level II trauma center in Chico.
“We are actively reviewing available resources to ensure our readiness to absorb anticipated increased patient volumes at the Enloe Health Emergency Department,” wrote Enloe Health in an unsigned statement. 
Glenn County’s two ambulances will also have to travel further and be outside the county for longer periods of time, leaving residents with even more limited emergency resources.
The announced closure is a stark reminder of the precarious state of California’s rural hospitals. Even with increased Medicare reimbursement, Glenn Medical Center’s annual financial statements show that the hospital consistently operated in the red.
Two years ago, the state bailed out 17 rural and community hospitals – Glenn Medical was not one of them – by loaning them close to $300 million altogether. That loan program was largely prompted by the closure of Madera Community Hospital, which also left an entire county without emergency services. After bankruptcy proceedings, Madera Community is now owned and operated by American Advanced Management, a for-profit company that has made a business out of rescuing distressed and shuttered hospitals. The company also owns Glenn Medical Center. 
“It’s devastating for our group from a personal perspective because we really do pride ourselves in being somebody who comes in and re-opens hospitals,” Still said. “When we go into a community, we make that promise to the community that we’re not going to bail on them.”

Especially, University of Utah researchers found, in these four moments:
“First, when they found their first job in the U.S. Second, after six months in the U.S., when they had to renew their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) application,” researchers wrote. “Third, when they were no longer receiving caseworkers’ support from resettlement agencies. Fourth, when they faced fluctuations in employment or household expenditures.”

University of Utah researchers collaborated with resettlement agencies in the state to conduct 36 interviews with refugees between July and September 2024 for a recently published study analyzing their temporal patterns of food insecurity. 
Refugees’ answers about the times in which they had the most difficulty affording food shocked Nasser Sharareh, the research assistant professor at the U. who led the study.
Utah refugee resettlement program finds self-sufficiency amid federal funding cuts

“Finding a job can make refugees more food insecure,” Sharareh said in a news release.
While resettlement agencies provide refugees with the necessary tools to become financially independent through jobs, often their first roles in the state are low-paying and unstable. Simultaneously, their earned income disqualifies them from having access to food assistance, like SNAP. 
With a paycheck that is still insufficient to cover food expenses, housing and utilities, refugees find themselves in crisis.
The refugees who participated in the study were predominantly in households with children and with an income below 185% of the federal poverty level.



Let us know what you think...


 


Food insecurity among different refugee groups living in the country can reach up to 85%, six times higher than the general national rate, which was 13.5% in 2023. About 83% of the surveyed participants reported food insecurity experiences in the past year. 
Some other factors contributing to food insecurity were language barriers while trying to get a job, or lack of awareness of the country’s food environment and programs, the study says.
While staff at resettlement agencies are well trained, researchers wrote, they have been historically underfunded throughout the country, limiting their ability to address refugees’ needs.
“The impact of these barriers has become even more significant in 2025 and could become worse in the future because the current U.S. administration has suspended refugees’ admission to the U.S. starting January 27, 2025,” the study says. “Consequently, caseworkers’ support has become very limited, as a large portion of resettlement agencies’ funding comes from the Office of Refugee Resettlement based on the number of newly admitted refugees.”
Despite these barriers, according to a 2024 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, refugees and asylees have produced a net fiscal impact of $123.8 billion from 2005 to 2019 — meaning that they have contributed more revenue than expenditures to the government, researchers wrote.
And overall, Sharareh added, reducing food insecurity will benefit the economy because of other factors. 
“Food insecurity is costing the U.S. health care system more than $53 billion annually,” he said in the release. “So besides having a public health impact, addressing food insecurity can have a positive economic impact on U.S. society.”

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey listens in the background. A Montgomery judge Friday issued a temporary restraining order against the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) in a lawsuit brought by Ivey and Ledbetter over the athletic eligibility of CHOOSE Act students. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A state court Friday blocked an Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSSA) policy barring transfer student-athletes from immediately participating in sports if they receive CHOOSE Act funds amid a lawsuit from Gov. Kay Ivey and Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville. 
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that offers families up to $7,000 per qualifying child per year for “non-public education” expenses, including private school tuition. The program currently operates under income caps scheduled to be lifted next year. 
The lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court, alleges AHSAA’s rules “specifically and unlawfully sideline CHOOSE Act students from AHSAA-sanctioned interscholastic athletic events for an entire year solely because they receive CHOOSE Act funds.”
“Every child deserves true choice in their education and that includes their right to participate in school athletics,” Ivey said in a statement Friday afternoon.  “The court’s decision restores fairness to the process which is, of course, the very basis of the CHOOSE Act.”
A message seeking comment was left with AHSAA on Friday. The AHSAA considers the CHOOSE Act a form of financial aid similar to scholarships or tuition reductions, and it requires students who receive that to be ineligible for sports for one year. AHSAA said in a statement Thursday that the rule is in place to prevent students from having unfair advantages.
“This policy, established by our member schools, promotes competitive equity and deters recruitment,” the organization said in its statement.
When the act was initially introduced in 2024, there was no language about high school athletics. During House floor debate over the bill in February of that year, Rep. Joe Lovvorn, R-Auburn, introduced an amendment saying that “Nothing in this chapter shall affect or change the athletic eligibility of student athletes governed by the Alabama High School Athletic Association or similar association.”
The amendment was adopted on a 74-17 vote. The language remained in the final version of the bill. 
Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Lovvorn.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the sponsor of the CHOOSE Act and the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, wrote in an email Friday that AHSAA was aware the governor and other politicians didn’t agree with the organization’s interpretation of the law.
“The Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the House, the chief legislative legal officer and the bill sponsor have expressed the legislative intent of the CHOOSE Act during numerous conversations with AHSAA officials. The AHSAA’s position and response is obtuse, baffling and certainly not with the best interest of children and families in mind,” he wrote.
Ledbetter said in a statement Thursday AHSAA created the policy without getting clarification from policymakers which leaves families at a disadvantage, and implied that action from policymakers could be taken against AHSAA during the upcoming legislative session.
“For the AHSAA’s leadership to take such drastic action just as football season begins tells me they are not concerned with the best interests of all student-athletes.” the statement said. “While I fully expect members of the House and Senate will take a hard look at how the AHSAA operates in the upcoming session, this situation demands action today. My hope is the court will side with our student-athletes and not allow this organization to wrongfully take away their opportunity to compete.”
The AHSAA in 2016 altered its rules to allow homeschooled students to play sports in the public school districts in which they reside.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

(Photo: Getty Images)Nearly 3,000 youth experiencing homelessness in Nevada reached out to various social service providers for help last year, a number that more than likely falls orders of magnitude short of the actual number of youths who lack stable housing.
Yet infrastructure and funding to prevent and end homelessness among youth is sorely lacking, a recent statewide report found.
Youth-serving nonprofits and advocacy groups, state and local agencies, homeless service providers, youth who have experienced homelessness, and social workers all collaborated on the two-year study. The findings were released in August in the Youth Experiencing Homelessness Statewide Report.
The report showed there were 2,834 youth ages 12 to 24 who were identified in 2024 through the Homeless Management Information System, which tracks service interventions among unhoused people – 2,868 were identified the year before.
There are only 430 beds in Nevada shelters dedicated specifically for the youth population, none of which are in the 15 rural counties. 
Of the many takeaways and recommendations, the report found Nevada “currently lacks the necessary infrastructure, leadership, and funding” to solve youth homelessness and needs a dedicated state entity if it wants to prevent and end youth homelessness.
The analysis comes amid uncertainty around what federal funding and resources will be available to address homelessness, yet alone for youth experiencing homelessness. 
The report underscores that Nevada needs to “take increased ownership and accountability for this issue,” said Arash Ghafoori, executive director Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth.
“We have relied on federal funding streams, federal definitions, and other federal entities that drive a lot of our system work when it comes to homelessness,” Ghafoori said. “Now that there’s sort of turbulent times there, it’s even more important to think about Nevada driving the investigation of what’s wrong, and driving the solution and investments” to address the problems.
Recommendations to address youth homelessness include developing a guaranteed basic income for youth, designating state general funds to build and support youth-specific housing and shelter beds, reducing barriers for youth to access housing and health care, and creating a statewide coordinated response to specifically address this population.  
The study estimates the cost of providing permanent housing for an individual youth at $20,014. Adding 1,000 youth-focused permanent housing options would cost the state an estimated $20 million a year. 
The analysis provides policymakers and providers a better understanding of “who the young people are from a demographic standpoint,” Andre Wade, state director of Silver State Equality who helped lead the study, said, adding it will help give the state a better insight of  “what interventions and resources are available, but more importantly, what’s not available and what’s needed.”
Added Ghafoori, “The money exists in our community. We need to prioritize it.” 
Understanding the issue
The transient nature of homelessness, along with inconsistent definitions of homelessness and reporting requirements, render the scope of Nevada youth homelessness difficult to understand, service providers say. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have different definitions of homelessness, with the former looking at literal homelessness – living in places not meant for human habitation – and the latter considering inadequate or infrequent housing like weekly motels. 
Similar problems exist when it comes to collecting youth demographic data  such as race or LGBTQ+ affiliation.
These longstanding problems became more apparent during the Covid pandemic, when the state received funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Wade said.
State and local officials began discussing how to use millions of dollars in unprecedented funding provided by ARPA to address the state’s ongoing housing shortage. 
“Housing for youth is rarely, if ever, part of the actual conversation,” he said. “There just wasn’t information about the number of young people to determine how much money we would want for housing.”
ARPA funding was used to kick off a two-year study starting in 2023 to better understand the number of youth experiencing homelessness, their specific needs, and what resources were lacking, culminating in the Youth Experiencing Homelessness Statewide Report.
‘Have not touched the system yet’
While less than 3,000 youth statewide sought services to address homelessness, an estimated 33,443 youth under the age of 24 in Nevada could experience homelessness or lack adequate stable housing in any given year. 
The estimate was based on “national prevalence data, which reports that 10% of young adults (18-25) and 3% of adolescents (13-17)” are unhoused over a course of a year, the report says.
”The actual number of young people … that we know we actually served, is still a significant undercount,”  Ghafoori said. “There’s so many young people that are doubled up. There’s so many young people that have not touched the system yet.”
There were less than 500 beds for youth experiencing homelessness in 2024, all of them in Clark and Washoe counties.
Nearly three-quarters of them are emergency shelter beds or transitional housing, which the report notes “are short-to-medium term options that, if not paired with permanent housing options can become cyclical and keep individuals in a state of instability rather than providing a long-term solution.”
“None of these beds are located in Nevada’s 15 rural counties, which may have as many as 3,309 youth experiencing homelessness each year,” the report notes. 
Youth homelessness in rural and tribal communities “often takes on less visible forms,” the report reads. 
“Young people in these communities may rely on extended family or informal networks for shelter due to a lack of formal housing providers that operate in their area,” the report says. “Youth aging out of foster care are especially vulnerable, and some youth may choose to leave their communities altogether in search of greater opportunity or support in urban areas.”
Only a quarter of youth “successfully exited to permanency” between 2021 and 2024 according to the report and “between 56% to 68% had no known exit to permanency during the period covered by the study.“
The findings show that two-third of youth “served in Nevada had no record of achieving housing
Permanency” during that same time period and that “at least 4,379 youth who entered homelessness with no evidence that they exited into a stable housing situation.”
Similar to adult homeless populations, there is a disproportionately large number of Black youth who experience homelessness. 
Of the youth that utilized services – again,  far from the true number of those in need – 41% identify as Black and 25% as white, according to the report. 
Though 6% identify as Hispanic, the report notes it’s likely an undercount due to inadequate data collection procedures, the improvement of which being among the state’s recommendations. 
The data and recommendations were compiled between July 2023 and January 2025. The report notes that “youth who reviewed recommendations in February 2025 suggested that the environment has changed for youth, with more expressing fear and concern about the future due to the changed, and continuously changing, environment.”
“Shifts in federal policies regarding homeless and social services may impact the resources and
frameworks available to support vulnerable youth, including LGBTQ+ individuals and youth of color,” the report says.
Inaction costs more
One of the report’s many recommendations calls on the state to establish housing trust funds “financed through dedicated revenue sources, such as real estate transaction fees or taxes.” 
Funding to confront youth homelessness isn’t just a moral imperative, the report reads. It makes the case for it to be an economic necessity, adding that “the cost of not ending youth homelessness is notably higher.”
Failing to invest in youth homelessness prevention not only leads to overburdening other systems, such as emergency rooms or jails, but there is “actually a labor force argument to investing in youth homelessness,” Ghafoori said. 
If elected officials can be convinced to think beyond “one-term optics and say, ‘hey, the state is going to be in a worse situation in 5, 10, and 15 years unless we take these actions,’ then maybe we can start convincing them, because there’s a price tag and there’s an impact to their future constituents and neighbors,” he said. 
Wade hopes the findings will persuade people who oppose the development of supportive housing in their neighborhoods. 
“We need to get young people off the street,” he said.  “A lot of the pushback across the U.S. is the NIMBY, not in my backyard. It’s going to take the community to be able to support these young people and possible projects that may be built in their neighborhood.”
While building housing, and expanding youth-specific beds, is important, it’s not the only solution the state needs to consider, Ghafoori said. 
“The solutions to youth homelessness are complex, they vary, and they just don’t necessarily involve infrastructure,” he said. “Although infrastructure is critically important, you can’t build a house without a foundation, and we need more of that sort of foundation happening in our community.”
One proposal highlighted in the report: direct cash transfers of guaranteed basic income, in which youth experiencing homelessness are given direct financial assistance. 
“We already know the advantages of (direct cash transfers) and how providing that basic income has been effective not just around the world in developed countries, but has been effective in the pilots here in the United States,” Ghafoori said. 
Other policy considerations the report highlights include decriminalizing “acts of survival” like sleeping in public places, limiting the use of criminal background checks in housing applications, investing in early intervention models such as family reunification for youth, and having policies tailored to LGBTQ+ youth and youth of color.
“This issue is getting shoved under the rug and doesn’t get the spotlight it deserves,” Ghafoori said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/homeless-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

CalMatters created a tool that allows anybody to explore the assets, gifts, and travel disclosed by state lawmakers.


In 2024, interest groups gave nearly $250,000 worth of gifts to California legislators and spent more than $820,000 taking them on trips across the world, according to annual financial transparency reports filed in March. That’s less than they gave in 2023 when lawmakers received $330,000 in gifts and more than $1.1 million on sponsored travel.

Sponsored travel
Organizations can pay for the travel of an elected official to a destination within California or beyond for educational purposes that often include touring a facility, going to a conference or learning about a policy issue. These organizations can also invite lobbyists or other guests to accompany legislators on these trips, allowing special access that is often undisclosed to the public.
In 2024, just like in 2022 and 2023, a nonprofit called the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, also known as CFEE, paid the most to take state legislators on trips to locations that included the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Taiwan. The group spent nearly $260,000 last year to pay for the travel of 42 legislators, almost one-third of all the money spent on lawmaker travel in 2024.
Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a Democrat from San Rafael, went on eight trips that cost $27,000, the most of anybody in the Legislature, while 28 officials didn’t report any travel. Connolly’s largest trip patron was CFEE.
Gifts
Legislators have to disclose any gifts they receive worth more than $50; if they received more than $590 in gifts from a single source in 2024 then they had to report it and reimburse the difference between the value and maximum gift amount to the gift-giver. In total, 108 legislators reported receiving gifts from more than 450 different sources last year, and 12 officials did not report receiving any gifts.
The single largest source of gifts last year was the California Democratic Party, which gave more than $27,000 in gifts, mostly as retreats and food, to 71 state lawmakers, including some Republicans.
About the data
State law requires every elected official to submit an annual financial transparency report each March to disclose any stocks, property or businesses they own, as well as gifts, sponsored travel and other income they received the previous year.
The documents, called Form 700s, are published by the Fair Political Practices Commission on their website as PDF files. We downloaded all of the reports filed by state legislators and used a Python script to crop each field on the form and then used OCR (which stands for Optical Character Recognition) to extract the value. Finally, we compared the extracted data to the original reports to verify accuracy.

Last year, nearly 100 interest groups spent more than $820,000 to sponsor trips for 92 state lawmakers.



Pick any day in 2024 and it’s more likely than not that a California state lawmaker was on a trip sponsored by corporations or nonprofits, many of whom frequently have business before the state.
Last year, those interest groups spent more than $820,000 to take dozens of legislators on both domestic and international trips, according to financial disclosure reports filed by elected officials in March of this year. The total is less than the $1.1 million spent on similar trips the year before.
Nearly 100 groups sponsored trips for 92 lawmakers, about three-quarters of the Legislature, to destinations that ranged from areas like Berkeley and Napa to far-flung places such as Hawaii, Europe, Southeast Asia and Israel.
The largest sponsor of travel for legislators last year was the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, or CFEE, which paid nearly $260,000 to take more than 40 lawmakers on domestic and international trips. The nonprofit was also the largest trip patron for legislators in 2022 and 2023.
CFEE is a unique creature in California politics and brings together many organizations that normally fight each other on legislation and regulation. Companies and nonprofits can effectively pay to acquire seats on the board, which includes representatives from Big Oil, organized labor, environmental groups, large companies, tribes, and other industry associations, and some board members are invited to accompany elected officials on the tours.
The international trips are called “study tours” by the nonprofit, and it publishes a list of the most recent destinations and associated study areas on its website. Nine legislators attended the March trip to the United Kingdom which focused on the impact of and technology related to climate change, such as home insurance, offshore wind development and aviation fuel. Six lawmakers attended a November trip to Taiwan and Vietnam focused on electric vehicles, high-speed rail and natural-disaster preparedness. 
Each study tour had both Democratic and Republican representatives in attendance and lawmakers who went said that made the trip even more valuable. “I’m a lefty Dem,” said Sen. Scott Wiener, Democrat from San Francisco, “and one of the things I appreciate about the Legislature is that we can work across the aisle.” 
The trips allow members to really get to know each other and find ways to work together, said Assemblymember Heath Flora, a Republican from Ripon. He added, “bipartisan legislation is the best legislation.”
Lawmakers who have attended trips organized by the nonprofit in the past have described the trips as a valuable way to learn from other countries and get ideas for future legislation.
Wiener, who went on the trip to the U.K, said he finds the trips to be “completely exhausting.” Flora attended the same trip and said the tours are “some of the most valuable trips we take as elected officials.”
Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat from Merced, also attended the trip to the U.K. and said she is carrying three bills this session that were directly inspired by the trip: one related to long-term water supply issues, one that would invest in fusion energy research, and one to study the emissions of biomass. 
The second-largest sponsor of trips lawmakers took in 2024 was the Independent Voter Project, a nonprofit that focuses on voter education of public policy issues. It spent more than $100,000 on a pair of trips for elected officials: an annual trip to Maui, hosted by the organization since at least 2016, attended by 17 legislators, and another to Valle de Guadalupe in Mexico with six lawmakers called the “Make it with Mexico Cross Border Conference.” Both trips had Democratic and Republican representatives.
The organization filed rarely used disclosure reports that provide transparency about the donors who attended the Maui trip. State law requires that organizations annually disclose any major donors who travel alongside elected officials, if the travel for elected officials in a year totals more than $10,000 or at least $5,000 to a single official and if the trip sponsorship accounts for at least one-third of the organization’s total expenses.
The Independent Voter Project filed disclosure reports going back to 2021 after CalMatters reported in 2023 that the law mandating transparency had only resulted in two submitted reports. There are now 11 filed reports, six from the Independent Voter Project.
The state’s ethics agency, the Fair Political Practices Commission, found in a 2024 audit that the one-third of total expenses requirement can create transparency gaps since some well-funded organizations might not meet that threshold and, therefore, be exempt from the reporting requirements.
More than 100 representatives of corporations, unions, and other nonprofits attended last year’s trip to Maui alongside the legislators, according to the trip donor disclosure report, many of which have frequent business before the Legislature, such as the state’s prison guard union, Pacific Gas & Electric, an oil industry group and a trade association for California hospitals.
Among the representatives from companies and advocacy groups was Autumn Burke, a former legislator who was elected in 2014 and abruptly resigned in 2022. Burke was listed as a donor and attendee using her 2026 campaign committee for Lt. Governor. 
According to her committee’s campaign finance disclosure, the trip cost at least $17,500 to attend. At the time of the trip to Hawaii she was a registered lobbyist with Axiom Advisors though Burke said she didn’t lobby at the event and that she doesn’t lobby the Legislature even back in Sacramento.
“I had a vote, I do not have one now,” Burke said, “and I’m not comfortable telling them how.” 
Instead, she said she went to learn more about policy matters in case she runs for office in the future. “I thought that I would at some point run again and this was one of the few venues that I had access to that allowed me informational education,” she told CalMatters in a phone interview.

The Jewish Community Relations Council and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles paid nearly $82,000 in total to send a delegation of seven Democratic lawmakers to Israel last February, including Democrats Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel from Encino and Wiener, both of whom are co-chairs of the Legislative Jewish Caucus.
One of the sponsors said the point of the trip was to develop connections between California and Israel. Jeremy Russell, director of communications for the Jewish Community Relations Council, wrote that that attendees met with Israelis and Palestinians as well as members of the Knesset, Israel’s national legislature, and visited a few cities in Israel. 
“The trips advance California and Israel’s long partnership on issues such as agriculture, technology and innovation,” Russell said.
Wiener said he went on the trip because Israel is home to about half of the world’s Jews and it was “important to see with my own eyes the horrors of the October 7th terror attack and to talk with the families of hostages” held by Hamas. But he said going to Israel doesn’t mean he supports the current government, which he called a “complete disaster.” 
“There are times I wonder if Netanyahu and his team are Iranian assets,” Wiener said, referring to the Israeli prime minister, “because they’re creating more danger for Israel, in addition to the horrors in Gaza.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Disclosure-Travel_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-08 08:56:28.880184

Public officials laughing and celebrating. Promises of major economic impact, even transformation. President Donald Trump said Huntsville would be known as the Rocket City, a name it has borne for decades.
Here’s another way it could resemble all those prior announcements: The predicted impact and the actual one almost certainly won’t match.

Trump claimed moving Space Command to north Alabama from its home in Colorado would create over 30,000 jobs. But another estimate was far lower: 1,600 direct jobs and 3,000 indirect jobs. That’s a blip in the Huntsville area, where about 277,000 people work.
U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville claimed the relocation would save the federal government $480 million, an estimate that government auditors have questioned.
It’s also not clear when Space Command will actually arrive in Alabama’s largest city. Colorado’s leaders, both Democratic and Republican, aren’t happy with Trump’s decision. The state’s attorney general has threatened to sue. Trump did himself no favors by suggesting at last week’s press conference that Colorado’s use of mail-in ballots factored into the move. (Alabama has those, too, though it’s far harder to use them here than in Colorado.)
Moreover, many Space Command employees — presently living in Colorado Springs — may prefer unemployment to the Yellowhammer State.
In a report from the U.S. Inspector General’s Office earlier this year, Space Command officials expressed concerns that the move could set their current state of readiness back four years.
Three officials also said they feared that a large part of the current Space Command workforce would leave rather than live in the Rocket City.
“Mission success is highly dependent on human capital and infrastructure,” the report quoted the commander of Space Command saying. He added that “there is risk that most of the 1,000 civilians, contractors, and reservists will not relocate to another location.”
Another official said that he only expected 4% of the employees in his section to leave Colorado.
We won’t know how many employees will make the trip until the move is complete. But it’s clear that a big problem with moving Space Command to Alabama is, well, Alabama. The leaders of the command think many of their employees — highly trained, highly educated and not easy to replace — would quit before moving to our state.
And honestly, I get it. Colorado has its own charms, of course. But how exactly are you going to persuade people to come here?
Education? Colorado is in the bottom half of per pupil public school spending in the country. But it still invests more in its children than Alabama does.
Public safety? Colorado’s homicide rate is less than half of Alabama’s. And despite having almost 1 million more people than Alabama, Colorado had 273 fewer firearm deaths in 2023.
Health care? Yeah, no. Colorado expanded Medicaid over 10 years ago, helping to slash its uninsured rate. Alabama’s hospitals and health care professionals have all but begged our state leaders to follow suit, citing the dire condition of rural hospitals and the economic benefits of expansion.
Instead, Alabama leaders sulked about former President Barack Obama and whined about the cost, while eagerly directing federal money into the construction of a megaprison in Elmore County and smiling as the price tag for the facility flew into the stratosphere.
And at least until Trump got involved, Colorado was pretty welcoming to transgender youth and didn’t blithely take their health care away from them. Nor do I see Colorado leaders panicking at the idea of a child reading a book with an LGBTQ character in it.
Oh, and Colorado treats women like adults. Where Alabama forces sexual assault victims to bear their attackers’ children and sees no problem with an abortion ban that makes the treatment of pregnancy complications far more difficult than it should be, Colorado voters last year voted to put abortion protections in their state constitution.
If you’re a Colorado woman working for Space Command, are you going to jump at the chance to move to a place that thinks so little of your health and safety? Or your daughter’s?
Huntsville is a fine city. It has a lot to do and is within driving distance of larger metro areas like Nashville and Atlanta. There’s some spectacular hiking and natural views nearby, and the beauty of east Tennessee and north Georgia are easily accessible. Huntsville’s city school system is rated the best among the state’s four largest cities. And it’s growing at a rapid clip.
So if you see people from Space Command in Colorado objecting to moving there, just remember: it’s really not Huntsville they have a problem with. It’s our state government.

Texas redrew its congressional map with the stated goal of electing five more Republicans to Congress next year. California is responding with an effort to do the same in favor of Democrats. Now, Missouri is getting in the act for the GOP.
Where will it end?
Well, not in Connecticut. 
Democrats control two-thirds of the seats in the General Assembly and the office of the governor, but they cannot unilaterally draw more favorable maps in either congressional or state legislative districts.  And even if they could, Democrats already hold all five congressional seats.
One side effect of Texas delivering President Donald J. Trump a made-to-order congressional map is the buzz — OK, more like misinformation — on social media about whether Connecticut’s solid-blue map is the product of the same hardball politics we’re seeing in Texas, California and Missouri.
Here’s how redistricting really works in Connecticut, how the congressional delegation went from 60% red to 80% blue in the midterm election of 2006, and why some people think they see a lobster claw in the congressional map. 
Is the absence of CT Republicans in Congress evidence of gerrymandering?
No, though the current congressional map is flawed, as judged against redistricting principles, such as making a district as compact as possible. And it makes little sense today, unless you understand its origins and how it was produced. 
But it wasn’t a Democratic gerrymander. In fact, it initially favored Republicans.
The foundation of the current map are the radical changes forced by the 2000 Census, when Connecticut lost one of its six U.S. House seats. It has since been only lightly tweaked after the census results of 2010 and 2020.
Democrat James Maloney of Danbury, who represented the 5th District, and Republican Nancy Johnson of New Britain, who represented the soon-to-be-extinct 6th District, ended up in the same district in 2002.
The newly drawn 5th was drawn less to serve the interest of voters than those of Maloney and Johnson. The goal was to set up a fair fight, which required hollowing out the once-compact 1st District of Greater Hartford.
Johnson won in 2002. In fact, Republicans won three of the five seats in 2002 and 2004. Democrats flipped the 5th and 2nd in 2006, capitalizing on the unpopularity of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. 
They completed the sweep in 2008, capturing the 4th in Fairfield County, helped by the coattails of Barack Obama. 
Johnson and Maloney are long gone from active politics. The ugly border between the 1st and 5th — the lobster claw —remains.
Why are congressional maps rarely drawn at mid-decade?
The impetus usually is equalizing the population of congressional districts after the completion of a decennial census, not reacting to the prospect of one party losing the House in a coming election.
Allocating congressional seats by population is a zero-sum game. The number of House seats remains constant at 435, and the courts have ruled each district should have roughly the same population to the extent that is practical. 
So that means the greater population growth in southern and western states shifted political power. The 2000 Census resulted in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas gaining two House seats, and California, Colorado, Nevada, and North Carolina gaining one.
New York and Pennsylvania lost two. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin lost one.
Who draws the maps in Connecticut?
In some states, winning control of the legislature means one party is in charge of drawing the map. Not so in Connecticut. The state constitution gives the task to an eight-person legislative committee with an equal number of House and Senate Republicans and Democrats. 
If they cannot agree on a map, then the legislators must choose eight members for a new reapportionment commission. Those eight members then must agree on a ninth member. If that fails to produce a consensus, the task of drawing new districts falls to the state Supreme Court.
Every 10 years, the legislators have little trouble negotiating new state legislative districts. But they have deadlocked on making changes to the congressional map. 
The result is that revising the congressional map after the 2010 and 2020 census was punted to the Supreme Court and a court-appointed special master, who have made only the minimal changes necessary to equalize the populations of the five districts. 
The court’s rationale: The map produced after the 2000 Census was fairly done, and it is up to the General Assembly to make more significant changes.
By the way, mapping software has made it relatively easy to draw new districts.
A work in progress: Using mapping software, Districtr.org, the CTMirror produced a congressional map that preserves the political balance of the current map, while eliminating its oddly jagged borders. The numbers do not reflect curent districts. Credit: CTMIRROR.ORG
If not the maps, how do you explain the lopsided results favoring Democrats?
The answer is numbers and trends.
First, the numbers. Only 21% of registered voters are Republicans, compared to 36% Democrats and 42% unaffiliated. Upscale suburbs that once were the GOP’s foundation, especially in Fairfield County, have been trending blue, just as some blue-collar suburbs have been going red.
The trend accelerated since the election of Trump.
Republicans fell to their modern low in 2008, when Obama’s popularity helped Democrats win majorities of 114-37 in the state House and 24-12 in the state Senate. The GOP steadily made gains, falling just short of majority in the House and winning an 18-18 tie in the Senate.
The GOP actually did fine with Trump topping the ballot in 2016, even though he badly lost the state: Republicans won an 18-18 tie in the state Senate and came within four seats of a House majority. 
But every election since Trump’s victory has been a problem for Republicans. The same legislative map that nearly produced parity in 2016 gave Democrats huge majorities in 2018 and 2020. 
The trend continued with the version produced after the 2020 Census.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-3.13.55-PM-1.png,,,2025-09-08 07:56:18.740134

(Courtesy of Rapid City Journal)Federal officials have chosen a long-lingering uranium mining proposal in southwestern South Dakota for an expedited permitting process.
That doesn’t mean the Dewey Burdock project is greenlit. Instead, it means the project will be included in FAST-41, a federal process meant to improve coordination among permitting agencies and hold them accountable to deadlines. The 25-person federal Permitting Council says it can shave 18 months off a project’s review time.
The Dewey Burdock project — named for rural locations near Edgemont along the southwestern edge of the Black Hills — has been in the works for nearly two decades. It requires numerous federal, state and local permits, and has been mired in administrative and court appeals for years.

The FAST-41 process was created by Title 41 of the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2015. Coverage originally focused on transportation infrastructure. It was expanded to mining projects during the final days of Donald Trump’s first presidential administration in 2021.
Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal officials to accelerate domestic critical mineral production, including copper, zinc, titanium and uranium. His administration is increasingly using FAST-41 to carry out the order.
Company says project could start in two years
EnCore Energy Executive Chairman William Sheriff said in a news release the Texas-based company is focused on “building a stronger domestic supply of clean and affordable energy and providing economic stimulus to southwest South Dakota.” Uranium is the key ingredient in nuclear power production.
Janet Lee-Sheriff, head of communications for enCore, said the company applied for FAST-41 with the expectation it would be a public, open and transparent process with clear deadlines.
The fast-track process can be misconstrued as “pushing permitting like a bulldozer,” Lee-Sheriff said. But there is no guarantee the project will be approved. 
NorthWestern Energy considers building a nuclear plant in South Dakota

“The reason we applied was because we wanted the federal process coordinated to give the state the confidence that this project will or won’t go forward,” Lee-Sheriff said. 
Once the permits are dealt with at the federal level, the state can begin its own permitting process.
Within the next two months, the Permitting Council will release a schedule that federal agencies and the company are expected to meet. Updates will be posted to the project’s page on the federal Permitting Dashboard.
If everything goes according to plan, Lee-Sheriff said, the project could be cleared through the federal process by next year, and the state permitting process could begin.
“In our best case, the state would get involved once they see this moving along at the federal level and we’d be able to advance the project toward development in a couple of years,” Lee-Sheriff said.
Opponents plan to continue challenging project
EnCore said in a news release that its method would have “minimal surface disturbance” compared to open pits and tunnels used to mine uranium in the same area from the 1950s to the ’70s. Lee-Sheriff described the operation as a series of “beehives” with piping underground.
The method is known as “in situ” mining: drilling wells to inject a water-based solution underground, dissolving uranium and pumping it to the surface. The water would be pulled from local aquifers and then treated and pumped back underground after being used for mining, causing opponents to fear pollution of local water sources.
Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said the organization formed in 2009 in response to the Dewey Burdock project. She said the organization will continue to oppose the project because of its potential threat to groundwater and the people who rely on it.
“There is a danger to water and to human health. Those are the two main threats,” Jarding said. 
The Oglala Sioux Tribe and NDN Collective have also opposed the project over concerns about potential impacts to historic and cultural sites in the Black Hills, which are central to some tribes’ traditional spiritual beliefs and practices.
Another company, Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., filed a uranium exploration permit application with South Dakota last year to explore for more uranium deposits along the southwestern edge of the Black Hills. That application, which is also opposed by the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, is under consideration by the state Board of Minerals and Environment.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/day5-004.jpg,,,2025-09-08 07:56:18.740134

Many Democrats are calling for a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter at Annunciation and in countless other mass shootings. These firearms, dubbed “assault weapons” for their military-style design and lethality, were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons.
Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the focus on guns, instead proposing increased funding for school security and mental health treatment.
Gov. Tim Walz, in announcing his intention to call a special session, said the public is with Democrats on gun control and Republicans risked public backlash by voting against it.
“If you ask the public about an assault weapon ban, it polls at about 80%. So if you want to go to the next election against the public here when we had an opportunity to do something about this, then I leave that to you,” Walz said.
Banning assault weapons only polls that high with Democrats, but past polls show it does have support from a majority of Minnesotans. So do other gun control policies like requirements for universal background checks, which passed in 2023, and, according to this year’s informal State Fair poll, banning guns in the Capitol with nearly 80% support.
Here’s what past opinion polls found about how Minnesotans and Americans overall feel about gun control.
54% of Minnesotans in 2022 strongly or somewhat favored banning assault weapons




Nearly half of surveyed Minnesotans strongly favored banning assault weapons in a 2022 MinnPost poll conducted with Change Research. An additional 7% said they somewhat favored banning assault weapons. That’s slightly less than the nation as a whole, according to a 2023 Pew Research poll.
That result is roughly in line with an older poll from the Star Tribune, which found that 58% of Minnesotans were in favor of banning assault weapons in 2019.
The MinnPost poll responses varied widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats saying they strongly favored a ban compared to 11% of Republicans. Opinions on high-capacity magazines were similar.


In the same poll, a majority of Minnesotans said that they thought gun laws should be stricter, while only 16% said that gun laws should be less strict.
The 2022 poll had 1,551 respondents and was weighted to better reflect Minnesota’s demographics in age, gender, ethnicity, 2020 vote and region, according to the MinnPost article reporting the results.
The same percentage of Minnesotans in 2023 supported changes to statewide gun safety laws
A different poll in 2023 found that over half of Minnesotans supported changes to gun safety laws. The poll was published by two gun violence prevention nonprofits, Giffords and Protect Minnesota, and executed by Expedition Strategies, an opinion research company.
That poll of 1,300 respondents also showed that the majority of Minnesotans across political affiliations supported the red flag law and universal background check requirement that were  passed in Minnesota in 2023.
None of these Minnesota-specific polls in recent years asked voters their thoughts on firearm safe storage laws, which were passed in the House but never came up for vote in the Senate. A nationwide poll by APM Research Lab found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans supported mandating locked gun storage in 2019, which included 68% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats polled.
(Last year’s State Fair poll found that nearly 7 in 10 respondents supported mandating locked and unloaded gun storage.)
A majority of Americans in 2023 thought it was too easy to obtain a gun


A notebook in a YouTube video believed to be made by the Annunciation Church shooter said it was “shockingly easy” to buy a gun, the Star Tribune reported.
The majority of Americans agree. In a 2023 Pew Research poll, around 6 in 10 Americans said that it’s too easy to legally purchase a gun.
The answer varies widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning respondents saying it’s too easy to purchase a gun. Only 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents agreed.


We see the same patterns for opinions on banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Overall, Americans and especially Democrats supported bans, but over half of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents opposed such bans at the time of the poll.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 09:56:09.776149

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The stakes of the current redistricting debate threaten the health of our representative democracy. This is not hyperbole. Most elementary definitions of democracy indicate that free and fair elections are a prerequisite for government responsiveness. Voters get to choose their elected officials. It should not work the other way around.
National Republicans have targeted Indiana among other states where they see an opportunity to exploit. All seven members of Indiana’s Republican congressional delegation support further eroding democracy in Indiana. Vice President J.D. Vance visited Indianapolis last month before Republican members of the General Assembly visited the White House for an arm-twisting session to engage in an unusual round of redistricting and explicit partisan gerrymander in advance of the 2026 cycle to preserve the Republican’s narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
I’d like to take the educational opportunity to correct how most people pronounce the word gerrymandering. I’m mindful this is appearing in print online, but I am confident that when people are reading it – they are saying it “jerrymandering” with a soft g. While political science professors like myself sometimes correct people whenever we get the chance, figures as diverse as stand-up comic John Mulaney to the U.S. Supreme Court have shared that it should be pronounced with a hard G (as in “Gary”).
The term gerrymandering is named after former Vice President and then Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. While he was Governor, districts were redrawn to benefit his Democratic-Republican Party. One of the oddly shaped districts resembled a salamander, and the term gerrymander (combining Gerry and salamander) was born. Setting this light-hearted history lesson aside, this blatant naked partisan power grab is extremely problematic and another step to further eroding the quality of democracy in the United States.
Gerrymandering in Indiana?
While some early opposition emerged that gave opponents of mid-decade redistricting hope, robocalls and political pressure, in addition the Washington, DC visit, are being utilized to move more Republicans to support this. It seems to be working as one early opponent said “I’m not opposed to it as I was.”  
Indiana’s State Legislature already engaged in gerrymandering after the 2020 Census, in part to redraw the 5th Congressional District to make it less competitive. At the time, George Washington University political science professor Christopher Warshaw identified that the maps had “historically extreme levels of partisan bias.” Now, in an effort to potentially pick up an additional seat, they may consider targeting Democratic Representatives Frank Mrvan or Andre Carson.
Indiana Republicans go to Washington D.C., critics rebuff redistricting push

To meet the principle of “one person, one vote,” the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are reapportioned across the fifty states (or reallocated based on changes in state population) after every U.S. Census. Once reapportionment occurs, it is up to each state to redraw their congressional and state legislative districts. The process varies by state as some states allow the elected state legislatures guide the process, like Indiana, whereas other states utilize independent and non-partisan commissions. 
States where partisan state legislatures control the process are more likely to engage in partisan gerrymanders. That “both sides” do it is problematic. In response to the Republican power grab in Texas (and potential targets like Indiana, Missouri, and other states), Democrats are proposing that they, too, would consider redistricting in states where they control state government like California and New York.
But choosing to fight “fire with fire” is dangerous as the problem with democratic backsliding is that it hard to stop. If Democrats in blue states do not return in kind, they are likely to stay in the political minority. If they do engage in this sort of redistricting, they are complicit and further erode trust in our political institutions. This is also problematic when representative forms of government engaged in anti-democratic behavior.
Who can we turn to?
The Courts? Not likely with the current composition. In a narrow 5-4 victory along ideological lines, Chief Justice wrote the majority opinion in the 2019 case Rucho v. Common Cause. The Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that stopped a partisan gerrymander in North Carolina. Roberts did so on a technicality by sidestepping the question of the constitutionality of partisan gerrymanders by calling it a “political question” to be decided by the elected bodies of government.
The Politicians? In general, elected officials are loathe to limit their own power. States that have been successful in implementing nonpartisan, independent commissions to handle redistricting rather than their partisan state legislature have largely utilized the ballot initiative. In Indiana, our elected officials do not trust us with that authority.
That may leave it to voters, who overwhelmingly oppose mid-decade redistricting, to apply pressure now and to utilize the ballot box next November. However, if legislators are choosing their constituents rather than the other way around, the choice is being taken away from the voters.

But new applicants will have to collect double the number of names and make twice the sales.,"An extensive license plate collection, belonging to Putnam County resident David Fuhrman, is shown on display in 2022. (Courtesy Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles)Hoosiers have poured almost $200 million into scholarships, medical research, child welfare and more in less than two decades — just by buying specialty license plates for their vehicles.
The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles has sold nearly 8 million on behalf of a wide array of organizations between 2007 and July 31 of this year, according to agency data.
Upwards of 100 groups participate in the program. Each has its own design and earns up to $25 on every initial sale and annual renewal.
“You have to get a license plate every year if you’re driving a car,” said Mary Jane Michalak, Ivy Tech Community College’s senior vice president of legal and public affairs. “And so, if you want to, (you can) provide support to Ivy Tech at the same time.” The institution enrolls about 180,000 students annually.
“It’s something that people can do to support their favorite organizations across the state and help open a new revenue stream for bringing some good works to Hoosier lives,” said Special Olympics Indiana spokesman Joe Frollo. The group has 70 county programs with 10,000 coaches and volunteers supporting 19,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities.

Indiana Code caps the number of specialty license plates at 150.
To get one, a group must submit a detailed application backed by signatures from would-be buyers and survive multiple stages of review by the BMV and state lawmakers.
To keep it, the group has to sell enough.
Some participants already struggle to meet the signature and sales standards. But new applicants will have to collect double the number of names and make twice the sales.
The hikes were nestled in House Enrolled Act 1390, this year’s BMV agency law. Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, authored it.
“Controlling the amount of them — not going over (the cap), not statutorily changing that number — is important because we don’t want to dilute the system,” Pressel said.
“We don’t want to have 5,000 different license plates in Indiana,” he added. “So, if they’re meant to be something special, then they really should be treated like that.”
Boosting budgets and brands
Indiana University and Purdue University top the participant list when it comes to revenue, respectively earning about $26 million and $22 million off their plates between 2007 and July 31. IU has sold more than 1 million, while Purdue is approaching 900,000.


Ivy Tech, another public higher education system, has earned about $373,000 off 15,000 sales over that time period.
“The license plate is a point of pride for our donors, community members, alumni and students,” Michalak said. “It’s a way for those who care about Ivy Tech to promote the organization and … it also gives meaningful support back to current students.”
That’s because, under the law, educational institutions must use plate money on scholarships for Indiana residents.
For instance, Ivy Tech students who can’t meet their total cost of attendance — even after federal and state financial aid is applied — can pull from the college’s general scholarships, according to Michalak.

State agencies have also benefited: an environmental plate funds land conservation, while a “kids first” edition goes to the prevention of child abuse and neglect.
Other big earners include the Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, the Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Trust, spay-neuter services, and organizations for nurses, sheriffs and professional firefighters.
The participant list is eclectic, with groups dedicated to conserving wild turkeys, golf, coal, museums and more.
“I think it’s serving its purpose by allowing folks to support the groups that are important to them,” Pressel said. “… It gives these organizations an opportunity to raise some dollars statewide and then be able to do good things with it.”
It’s also a brand-building opportunity. Pressel likened the plates to “small billboards going up and down the road.”
The Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter, which is in its first year of the program, plans to use plate revenue to accelerate treatment research and talk to Hoosiers — over social media and in person — about the warning signs, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment options.

“If you’re sitting in traffic on (Interstate) 465 … (and) see that plate, chances are they probably know someone that’s affected by this disease,” Sarah Donsbach, the chapter’s director of state affairs, said. “And we’re hoping that will prompt them to Google us, or to say, ‘That’s a really cool plate. I’d like to put that on my car.'”
Special Olympics Indiana puts its plate proceeds toward free, year-round training and competitions for athletes of all ages across a whopping 20 sports statewide.
The programming allows Hoosiers with intellectual disabilities to “enjoy the camaraderie and the fun of sports and competitions, just like everybody else enjoys doing,” Frollo said.
Some groups have come under fire, however.
The state’s second-highest official, Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, and his Anti-Woke Advisory Committee have recommended an audit of the specialty license plate program to ensure participants are complying with “anti-DEI executive orders,” the Indiana Citizen reported.

The committee specifically called out the Indiana Youth Group, which supports young LGBTQ Hoosiers. CEO Chris Paulsen told the Citizen that the plate revenue helps his group provide food, clothing, and resources for those experiencing homelessness and other financial hardship.
BMV spokesman Greg Dunn told the Capital Chronicle that the agency “has not performed any anti-DEI audits” of program participants.
Indiana has other so-called “distinctive” plates, like the popular Hoosier veteran and Indiana Colts team designs, but they are explicitly excluded from the specialty plate requirements. The number of sales and amount of revenue for such plates were excluded from the totals in this article.
A higher bar
An average of 10 organizations annually have tried to join the program over the last five years, according to the BMV.
It’s a “complex” process, Pressel said.
Wannabe participants must submit a 14-part application by April for possible plate issuance the following year. But the toughest requirement to meet is for signatures of residents who pledge to purchase the plate.
Applicants used to be on the hook for 500, gathered within any amount of time. Beginning July 1, that’s doubled to 1,000 dated signatures collected within a single year.
The BMV checks submissions for completion, then forwards them to an interim legislative committee — led by Pressel and Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield — for review.
The committee makes its recommendations. Then, the agency conducts its own review. Just five can be recommended and approved annually, at most.
Pressel’s law also doubled maintenance requirements.
Groups already in the program must sell 500 in the first two years and then annually. For plates issued after Jan. 1, the bar rises to 1,000 sales in the first two years and annually after.
Some clear the bar easily.

“For us, it’s not been difficult to meet the requirement,” Ivy Tech’s Michalak said. “I think the challenge is just ensuring that we continue to make the case to individuals that this is a great way to support students.”
But those that fall short spend a year on probation. Missing the mark a second time results in termination.
“We were having quite a few folks struggling,” Pressel said.
His theory? Groups that took multiple years to get 500 signatures — which are an expression of interest rather than a commitment to buy — had “slim to none” chances of cracking 500 sales a year, every year.
“And that’s why the interim committee’s seeing some of these license plates come back to us, and we were having to take some away,” Pressel said. “So, rather than have to deal with that, maybe set the standard a little bit higher and set the time frame a little bit shorter.”
“By raising the bar, I think we streamline that process a little bit, and we don’t give anybody any false hope,” he added.
From 2007 through 2024, an average of 15 groups annually failed to make 500 sales, according to BMV data. At a 1,000-sale cutoff, 34 would’ve failed each year, on average.
Current participants are grandfathered into the lower sales requirement. The hike is prospective because “that’s not what they agreed to” when they signed up, Pressel said.
His goal was to ensure the BMV at least breaks even on managing and producing less popular plates.
The BMV indicated that’s not a concern, however.
The agency “does not incur additional costs to produce or administer these plates,” Dunn said.
On the edge
Thousands descended upon Ohio’s Kings Island one sweltering July weekend for an adventure away from medical appointments, treatments, bills and fears.
Parents, healthy children and those with life-threatening medical conditions frolicked free of charge, in a collaboration between Hoosier and Buckeye chapters of children’s charity A Kid Again.
In November, they will gather again at the Indiana State Fairgrounds for a “winter wonderland” featuring a Santa Claus, a DJ, bounce houses, face painting, rabbits and more.
“These families usually feel very isolated and very alone and or forgotten,” said Katie Pappas, who leads A Kid Again’s Indiana chapter.
The outings — dubbed “adventures” — give them “hope,” time to make memories together and connect with others like them, outside the doctor’s office.
But, because enrollment has ballooned from a couple dozen to more than 1,200 families, “there’s no way a venue or a partner can cover that whole cost for us,” Pappas said. Donations are key.

After chapters in Ohio earned “significant” support off speciality license plates there, A Kid Again Indiana spent two years gathering signatures to get its own.
“It may be small to some, but it’s honestly huge to us,” Pappas said. “It’s that recurring gift, every month, that … helps us as an organization become more sustainable, not only from a financial standpoint, but also from a brand-awareness standpoint.”
The chapter often hears from families who’ve unexpectedly connected with fellow enrollees at Riley, the Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital at Ascension St. Vincent or even the grocery store via the plate.
“The joy that comes out of them … it’ll melt your heart,” Pappas said.
But three years in, A Kid Again Indiana has fallen short on sales and is on probation. The chapter could lose its plate at the turn of the year.
Pappas’ team has embarked on an “all-out blitz” to keep the plate — highlighting it in communications with enrollees, donors and volunteers; posting on social media and running paid advertisements; printing big posters about the plate to display at adventures and fundraising events; and more.
Still, Pappas is worried.
If the chapter is kicked out of the program, it would have to wait two years to reapply. Then, it would be subject to the higher signature and sales requirements.
“We’ll really have to take a look at: is it worth our time? Because we are so small and lean as a staff, I’m just not sure that it’ll make sense,” she said.

Why that plan is complicated,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/08/democratic-governor-hopeful-wants-to-freeze-electric-rates-why-that-plan-is-complicated/,"State officials can't stop capacity costs that are driving power price spikes, but they could offset them elsewhere on utility bills.","Gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Mikie Sherrill wants to freeze electric rates — a plan that faces some hurdles if Sherrill is elected governor in November. (Getty Images)A pitch by Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to freeze energy rates for a year if she is elected governor in the fall could boost affordability for New Jersey residents amid a steep and continuing spike to wholesale electricity prices — but designing such a freeze won’t be simple.
Sherrill’s path to rate caps would prove winding because the price-setting capacity auctions spurring recent rate spikes fall outside of state officials’ control, and offsetting those increases elsewhere could cost the state hundreds of millions in revenue, risk delaying new power generation, or leave ratepayers with larger bills down the line.
New Jersey and the 12 other states on the grid run by PJM Interconnection have seen electricity prices soar as artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy needs push demand toward the edge of the grid’s peak power output, spurring concerns over affordability across the system.
Sherrill’s pitch comes as New Jerseyans’ rising electric bills have become a key issue in this year’s race for governor. Sherrill in November faces Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli.
“A lot of the costs in a customer’s bill are direct pass-throughs from PJM. Those costs can’t really be frozen. You’re going to continue to see those costs show up on your electric bill,” said Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who studies energy regulation.
But regulators still have opportunities to offset rising energy prices to keep the consumer rates steady by requiring regulators to temporarily bar investments in grid infrastructure, delay utilities’ ability to recoup the cost of prior investments, or lower utilities’ profit margins on those investments, Silverman said.
Utilities’ profit margins on investments are typically fixed at about 9.6% in New Jersey, and the state’s four electric distribution companies — regulated utilities like PSE&G and Jersey Central Power and Light that deliver bills and electricity to customers — do not profit on the sale of electricity, which they pass through at cost.
Each of Sherrill’s options comes at a cost. Delays to some infrastructure upgrades can lock out new generation and reduce grid reliability. 
Regulators have already delayed some transmission infrastructure related to offshore wind projects that are stalled amid a federal permitting and leasing freeze.
Delaying utilities’ ability to recoup their investments could expose the state’s four electric distribution companies to financial harm, while lowering their ability to profit from infrastructure projects could disincentivize future grid upgrades.
It’s not clear how ready New Jersey’s four regulated utilities are to withstand the economics of a rate freeze.
A spokesperson for the New Jersey Utilities Association did not return a request for comment. A statement issued by the association’s president, Rich Henning, in response to Sherrill’s proposal acknowledged growing price concerns but did not directly state a position on a rate freeze.
“We share New Jersey residents’ frustration with the significant bill increases from higher energy supply costs,” Henning said in the statement. “It’s important to remember that New Jersey electric companies don’t control or earn any profit from electric supply prices. We have been sounding the alarm on the power supply-demand imbalance and advocating for market reforms for years.”
Wholesale electricity prices are set by a three-year blend of annual auction prices. New Jersey’s electric distribution companies play no role in that process, though polling has shown residents still place the largest share of blame for rising prices on their utility provider.
Other parts of ratepayers’ bills, like certain energy sales taxes or the state’s societal benefits charge — a roughly 3% surcharge on all New Jersey electricity bills — could be targeted to reduce rates, Silverman said.
Changes there could also be unattractive for a new governor facing budgetary challenges. Reducing energy sales taxes would impact revenue at the state and local levels. The state is expected to collect more than $1.1 billion from sales taxes on energy in the current fiscal year, including through energy tax receipts that are meant to be passed on to municipalities but are mostly retained by the state.
The societal benefits charge helps fund energy assistance and efficiency programs, and officials have tapped its funds to incent solar and battery storage projects, which come online far faster than other types of generation.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities can delay utility projects and recoupments under its own regulatory power. Legislation could force a freeze, as it did when lawmakers overhauled the state’s regulatory system for energy in 1999.

Though much about Sherrill’s proposal remains unknown — her campaign did not return answers to a list of detailed questions about a rate freeze — she has said the freeze would remain in place for a year.
“On Day One as governor, I will declare a State of Emergency on Utility Costs and freeze rate hikes so families will not see bill increases as we massively expand cheaper energy generation to bring costs down,” the congresswoman said in a statement. “My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it.”
Capacity prices are set to rise again next year as a result of a price-setting auction held in July. PJM has said those results are expected to raise ratepayer bills by between 1.5% and 5%, depending on a resident’s state, beginning June 1, 2026, or about six months into the new governor’s term.
Board of Public Utilities officials expect further increases to flow from next July’s capacity auctions, which would affect energy prices beginning June 2027.
There’s another, simpler avenue to freezing electricity rates: Officials could keep energy rates locked in place by directing utilities to defer seeking payment of the portions of bills that exceed price caps.
Bill deferrals aren’t unprecedented in New Jersey, though prior efforts have delivered mixed results.
In a bid to boost competition and reduce costs, New Jersey in 1999 decoupled electricity generators from the state’s regulated utilities. (PSE&G continues to operate nuclear plants in South Jersey.)
The Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act mandated that electricity rates be reduced by 10% then locked in place for a period of years, and allowed electric distribution companies to recover their generation costs, even when those costs exceeded price caps. Effectively, ratepayers were billed for only a portion of their electricity use, while the remaining portions were deferred.
A task force convened on the issue by then-Gov. Jim McGreevey estimated residential ratepayers’ deferred balances would reach an average of $299 by August 2003, before interest. That would be about $523 in real terms. 
Commercial and industrial customers’ deferred balances were far larger, averaging $2,362 and $34,827, respectively. At the time, utilities said they could need rate increases as large as 20% to cover the difference.
Silverman, a former general counsel for the utilities board, warned deregulation may not be the best point of comparison, as that shift entailed broad changes to the state’s regulatory system and allowances for utilities to recover costs from generation-related investments they were now required to shed.
“The better example might be pandemic cost recovery issues because restructuring was sort of a one-time thing where all the parties got together and negotiated and talked about how you were going to handle the transition, who was going to be paying what, what costs were locked in for what period of time,” he said.
When COVID-19-related business closures led to skyrocketing unemployment rates, utilities were barred from shutting off service for nonpayment between March 2020 and March 2023. Pandemic arrearages across hundreds of thousands of accounts rose above $416 million at the end of March 2023.
Jersey Central Power and Light, Atlantic City Electric, and Rockland Electric Company reported nearly $109 million in arrearages in July and June. PSE&G said its customers owed nearly $262.8 million in February, the most recent month for which filings are available. Utilities have forgiven millions in pandemic-related customer debts.

Some of the requests are months old, but all but one were submitted this year, said Stephanie Whitaker, spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office.
And while higher than most state agencies, the 126 requests is an improvement on the 224 Hanaway’s predecessor, Andrew Bailey, inherited when he took office in 2023. That number ballooned at one point during Bailey’s short stint as attorney general to more than 400, with Missourians stuck in limbo for months — and in some cases, years — waiting for public records to be turned over.
The backlog of public records requests has bedeviled Bailey since he was appointed to take over the office after Eric Schmitt resigned to join the U.S. Senate. It’s a situation observers say would be unacceptable for any government agency but is especially problematic for the office in charge of enforcing Missouri’s Sunshine Law — designed to ensure the public has access to government records and meetings. 
Bailey assigned five staffers to deal with Missouri Sunshine Law backlog, Whitaker said — four attorneys, one intern and a custodian of records. It’s why only 126 requests remain unfinished, she said, despite the office receiving more than 400 between January and July. 
“There is definitely not a massive backlog that Catherine will be inheriting,” Whitaker said. 
‘Black hole’: Public faces long delays obtaining records from Missouri attorney general

 
Bailey is resigning from office early to become co-deputy director of the FBI. Gov. Mike Kehoe appointed Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and speaker of the Missouri House, as his replacement. She will be sworn into office in a private ceremony Monday morning.
Testifying to a Missouri Senate committee in February, Bailey said the office had received 1,465 requests under the Sunshine Law since January 2023 and managed to complete work on 1,390. Only 75 pending requests remained, he said at the time, a tally some lawmakers still felt was too high.
The only request left over from 2024, Whitaker said, produced more than 40,000 records and will take some time to complete. But, she said that is not slowing down work on others. 
Whitaker signaled a change in the office’s policy that has focused on working through requests on a first come, first serve basis. That meant newer inquiries that were small and easily dispensed with sat on hold as staff worked on older and more expansive requests.
Critics argued the policy exacerbated the problem, letting requests pile up and ensuring the backlog took even longer to work through.
Whitaker said that’s no longer the case. 
“It has changed a little,” she said. “We’re not putting you or anyone else on hold to satisfy this one request from 2024. So it would not be accurate to say inquiries are fulfilled in the order they’ve been received.”
But that doesn’t mean the public doesn’t still face delays.
In May, The Independent submitted a request for Bailey’s public calendar. Most state agencies turn around that type of request in a matter of days. The attorney general’s office turned the records over last week. 
While slow, it’s still an improvement over previous attempts by The Independent to access Bailey’s calendar that took more than 10 months.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1063332692-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

It has not survived thus far without courageous voices defending it.
It will neither survive today nor move forward without our courageous voices.
Let us keep in mind that America is an infant compared to many countries.
Next year we will be celebrating 250 years of this country’s unique existence. What will we be celebrating?
America’s strength, when challenged, has been in her people’s ability to put aside their selfish needs and interests and come together, fight and even die for the values and way of life that have set this country apart.
Historically, this has been the case whether the threat was from external or internal adversaries.
Whether it was entering World War I to make the world safe for democracy, or World War II in the fight against fascism, or even back to our own Civil War, courageous people came together for a greater cause.
There have been many other threats to our democracy since this nation’s founding. But the people stood and fought for the fundamental principles and what they believed was  good about democracy and the way of life it provides.
Fast forward to today. We are confronted by a different kind of assault against our democratic form of government.
It is both an internal and external threat playing out at the same time for all to see.
Within our borders, in a barrage of rapid fire, we are at once confronted with major challenges of how we should continue to function as a democratic republic. Simultaneously, we see long-standing agreements undone and radical shifts in how we relate to other countries.
On the world stage, there are signs that America’s allies and foes alike are wondering what America stands for as they encounter and endure a whiplash of positions caused by policies and actions changing almost on a daily or weekly basis.
Here at home, efforts are afoot at the local, state and federal level to eliminate, nullify and render impotent the bedrock of our democratic form of government: the constitution where the will and power of the people as expressed in elections and adherence to the rule of law are inherent.
Many of those efforts did not begin recently.
Look at the fundamental right of voting. In recent years, many states have pursued and implemented measures to make it difficult for long-standing citizens to cast a vote.
Today, at the federal level, the executive branch is seeking to change by edict how we cast our vote, eliminating some ways altogether rather than making exercising the vote more accessible.
Such efforts can only result in disenfranchising and silencing many legitimate and deserving citizens voices.
It does not stop there.
Look at what is happening in states calling special legislative sessions to change Congressional districts simply to influence the distribution of partisan political power, with utter disregard for whose voting power they minimize or totally silence.
It is happening in Missouri and other states.
There is more.
In Missouri, while the legislature has returned for a special session to redraw districts mid-census to control the balance of power in Washington, they are also going to try to pass legislation to make direct participation in the democratic process more difficulty by setting higher hurdles for a petition initiative to pass.
So, what are we to do?
Nothing?
There is an adage worth remembering: If you don’t use it, you lose it.
While often issued as a warning to maintain optimum body functions and usefulness through regular and rigorous exercises, it also applies to other areas.
As in physical health and relationships, it seems particularly apropos to exercising our individual rights to maintain, protect and preserve our democracy.
We can complain about what our elected representatives are doing or not doing to uphold our state and U.S constitutions, to uphold the rule of law, to represent, protect and advance our interests.
We can complain about their cowardice, their repeated propensity to put their selfish interests ahead of their constituents, but why are they comfortable doing it time after  time, during election term after election term?
Because we are not using the powers invested in us. More importantly, we are at risk of losing them.
We cannot afford to continue to embrace a sedentary political life, characterized by silence, inaction where we allow others — our own elected officials or outsiders to dictate what goes on in our state, how the public process and decisions are determined without input or oversight.
We must use and exercise our political power to ensure a political process that makes decisions that are in our best interests.

The facility, Algoa Correctional Center, is one of four Missouri prisons with no air conditioning in any of the housing units. In Jefferson City, where Algoa is located, the first 90-degree day of the year arrived in May.
The following month, a blistering heat wave torched the Midwest, bringing temperatures in the mid-90s for a week straight. Similar bouts of extreme heat continued into July and August, following a pattern of record-breaking temperatures that has become increasingly common in recent years.

In July, attorneys argued that Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh should require the Missouri Department of Corrections to immediately create a heat mitigation plan for Algoa.
When a man housed at Algoa died on July 23, MacArthur Justice Center attorneys were concerned that his death could be heat-related. Missouri Department of Corrections Communications Director Karen Pojmann said on Aug. 22 that an autopsy has been ordered, and the cause of death is still unconfirmed. Pojmann added that, to date, there have been no heat-related deaths in Missouri prisons.
“Multiple times throughout the summer, conditions were ripe for heat-related illness or death,” said Shubra Ohri, one of the lawyers on the case. “There were a few weeks where the heat index surpassed 100 degrees for days. The risk of heatstroke was scary and acute, and it happens every year.”
As of Sept. 2, Limbaugh has yet to issue a ruling on a mitigation plan.
While litigation unfolds, people in prisons without air conditioning continue to endure the effects of extreme heat, which is often exacerbated by building materials that trap heat and humidity.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis asked Jeremy Hann, one of the people who gave sworn testimony in the lawsuit against Algoa, to log his days during the first heat wave of the summer. The heat wave began on June 20 and lasted for about a week, with outdoor air temperatures reaching 96 degrees Fahrenheit and a heat index of up to 105 degrees in eastern Missouri, according to the National Weather Service.
Hann has since been relocated to Boonville Correctional Center, and is scheduled to be released later this year. Originally from Kansas City, he earned his high school equivalency while in prison and is currently enrolled in Missouri’s Central Methodist University, studying business. The log below is representative of entries from the week, drawing mostly from Sunday, June 22. Entries have been edited for length and clarity.
 6 a.m.

I wake up to the lights on — breakfast! It’s hot already, my pillow mat and sheets are soaked in sweat. For breakfast, it’s oatmeal and peanut butter. I eat, but it makes my stomach hurt it’s so hot! I lay back down and try my best to go back to bed.
The worst part about this whole thing is my sink hardly works — water just trickles from the hole it comes out of. The drain doesn’t drain more than maybe a centimeter an hour. There is a film over the water that’s in there, and rust around the edges of the sink … so I have no fluids to drink other than ice in a cup they give us, or the drink we get with our meals. I can hear a fan in the hallway, but feel no air.
I finally fall asleep by counting the water droplets as they drip into my sink.
 11 a.m.

I get woken up again for lunch time, but I can’t eat – it’s so hot and miserable. I have a sick feeling in my stomach. My face, arms, and upper body are sticky from sweating in my sleep.
Even as I lay here writing this, I have a cold rag on my chest and it’s almost dry already. I just dunked it in the nasty sink water — it stinks, but it’s all we got to cool off with.
 12 p.m.

It is now ice pass (when correctional officers hand out a cup of ice to people on hot days) and I get super excited — it’s like Christmas! I have my insulated cup with me, so the ice lasts about 2 hours unless I eat it really fast to cool off. Without the cup, it melts in a matter of minutes.
With no airflow, though, I can still hardly eat lunch. I just lay on my bunk, which is still damp, and the humidity is up today so that doesn’t help the sheets to dry.
I flip my pillow over, and the pillow case has already got rust on it.
 3 p.m.

The new shift of correctional officers comes in and I’m already really thirsty – out of ice and no water to drink. I’ve asked the officers to tell maintenance to come fix the sink. They haven’t, but still I ask every day.
I’ve got my towel on my pillow and a T-shirt on my mat to keep the sweat off. Like this, it’s just tolerable. Again, the fan in the hallway is a teaser. I wonder: How can this be legal? Dinner is soon and I’m not even close to being hungry because of the heat.
 4 p.m.

The correctional officers bring us the dinner trays, but the best thing is the sweet tea. I wait for ice to drink it.
It’s really muggy and the smell of food makes my stomach super nauseous, but I eat anyways because I’m starving. I get done eating and wait for them to bring around the last ice we get till tomorrow morning. I lay here looking around the cell and think, How is this humane? There’s mold on the walls close to the ceiling. I feel like these conditions are worse than most pigs and cows get treated.
 6 p.m.

It’s heating up in here, so I sit up on my bunk and try to focus on my book. I can’t, so I watch the Pando app (a Christian app for incarcerated people) on my tablet … ice finally comes and it’s like I won the lottery. But it’s short-lived because the ice melts super fast again, so I just lay down and close my eyes. It’s hard to breathe so I just hope it cools down soon.
 7:30 p.m.

I don’t want to lay down, so I pace the cell. I have run out of ice and it’s so humid it’s miserable. I wish they would transfer me so I could get out of this hole.
 11 p.m.

It’s finally starting to cool down. I close my eyes and try to get comfortable. Finally the light goes out, but I’m still uncomfortable. It’s so sticky, I know it’s going to be dreadful sleeping tonight.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUOVO_STL-HEAT-LOG_250904_header-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

Winters with enough snow cover that the family of ski-enthusiasts could get on the slopes from Thanksgiving to Easter. 
But despite the state’s continued connection with ice and snow, winters like those of her family’s past are gone. Climate change has caused Wisconsin’s winters to warm more than any other season. A number of recent winters have seen drought conditions with little to no snow across the northern part of the state — severely damaging winter tourism and canceling or modifying events such as the American Birkebeiner. While data shows that the amount of snowfall on average is similar to decades past, the weather doesn’t stay as cold throughout the winter, meaning that the snow melts before it can accumulate to the truly deep levels of previous generations.

“I hear all these great stories about how they got to ski over Thanksgiving, how they skied past Easter time, how they went on all these great trips around the state of Wisconsin to all these ski hills, mountains, all these amazing places,” Dunn, a 17-year-old Onalaska resident, tells the Wisconsin Examiner. “And I can’t help but feel incredibly saddened by this. I will never experience these things. These are family traditions, trips that my family would go on, with family members, with friends, and do all these amazing and fun things. And honestly, I do feel left out. I feel let down by my state. I can no longer enjoy these things due to the direct results of fossil fuels in the environment.” 
Dunn is one of 15 young people suing the state of Wisconsin, arguing that state laws violate their constitutional rights and worsen climate change. The lawsuit mirrors a similar lawsuit from children in Montana, who successfully argued that the state had to consider the greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impact of permits involving fossil fuels. 
The children are represented in the lawsuit by Madison-based Midwest Environmental Advocates and Oregon-based Our Children’s Trust. 
In Wisconsin, the suit argues that state lawmakers have made a number of declarations that the state’s energy production should be decarbonized and the greenhouse gas emissions of that production should be reduced, but state laws prevent that from happening. 
The state’s law for siting power plants requires that the state Public Service Commission determine that “[t]he proposed facility will not have undue adverse impact on other environmental values such as, but not limited to, ecological balance, public health and welfare, historic sites, geological formations, the aesthetics of land and water and recreational use.” However the law also prohibits the PSC from considering air pollution, including from greenhouse gas emissions, in that determination. 
Additionally, the state set a goal in 2005 that 10% of Wisconsin’s energy come from renewable sources by 2015. That goal was met in 2013. However, now that the goal has been met, state law treats it as a ceiling on renewable energy the PSC can require. 
“The Commission cannot require any electric provider to increase its percentage of renewable energy generation above the required level,” the lawsuit states, meaning that for more than a decade, Wisconsin’s energy regulators have been unable to push the state’s power companies to develop more renewable energy sources. 
Coal and natural gas make up 75% of the energy produced in Wisconsin and renewable sources make up 17%. 
Skylar Harris, an attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, says that children today are going to spend most of their lives dealing with the effects of climate change on their health and lifestyles yet don’t yet have the ability to vote and influence environmental policy. 
“I think people are really starting to acknowledge the direness of the situation that we’re in and the situation that climate change is causing, and how it impacts our inherent rights such as life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Harris says. “And courts are really starting to see that without the right to a stable climate, which is what we’re arguing for in this case, the rights to life, the rights to liberty, the rights to the pursuit of happiness, they mean nothing, because people can’t pursue them to the fullest extent.” 
Harris says that if the lawsuit is successful, she believes that the PSC will use its new authority to deny permits for new or expanded fossil fuel burning power plants and push the state’s power companies to expand their renewable capacities. 
In the Montana lawsuit, officials argued that the state can’t be held responsible for the effects of climate change on the children in that lawsuit because climate change is caused by emissions from across the globe. Harris says that yes, climate change is a global problem, but it gets fixed by individual governments doing something about it. 
“Climate change is a global problem, but there is no such thing as a global government,” she says. “So if we are to address this global issue, that means every individual, every business and every government, including the state of Wisconsin, has to step forward and do its part. And that’s what we’re trying to make sure is happening with this lawsuit.”
The 15 children in the lawsuit represent a wide swathe of Wisconsin. They live in urban and rural parts of the state and include athletes who have had wildfire smoke affect their sports, farm kids who have had droughts and heavy rains affect their families’ livelihoods and members of the state’s Native American tribes who have seen their cultural traditions put at risk. 
Dunn has spent much of her childhood fighting for environmental causes as president of her local 4-H club and has won three grants for environmentally focused projects from the Bloomberg Philanthropies Climate Action Fund. She says she joined the lawsuit because it can help her community and kids like her across the state. 
“I began my environmental work because I always believed in doing the right thing,” she says. “I believe in fighting for my community, fighting for my family, fighting for my siblings, fighting for everyone, fighting for youth and fighting for families.”
She adds that the PSC “knows that what they are doing is wrong. The governor and the Wisconsin Legislature have indicated that they want renewable energy, and the Public Service Commission simply isn’t changing the laws, and the Legislature isn’t changing the laws.” 
Dunn’s family has lived western Wisconsin’s Driftless Region for generations and she spent most of her childhood in Vernon County. She says the Mississippi River is “almost a family member.”
But massive rain events causing flooding and erosion triggered a massive boulder to tumble down a bluff and into her backyard, making her family fear that it wasn’t safe in their home anymore. They moved north to La Crosse County. 
“We felt very unsafe in the childhood home that I planned to live my entire life in. We made the difficult decision to move cities, move counties, move school districts,” she says. 
A member of her school’s tennis team, Dunn says hotter summers and poor air quality caused by wildfires elsewhere on the continent have forced her to change how and when she practices. Flooding has prevented her and her family from swimming off the dock at her grandparents’ home and affected the work done at their walnut tree farm. 
Dunn says that for her, joining the lawsuit is about standing up and trying to force her state government to admit it has a role to play in mitigating climate change and responding to the ways in which climate change has harmed her life and the lives of the other kids in the suit. 
“Ultimately, our country knows the science that is creating climate change, the fossil fuel industry, and especially Wisconsin, they can no longer stand behind saying, ‘There’s nothing we can do. We don’t know about it. There’s nothing that we can do,’” she says. “But ultimately, we have the science and technology to make changes and to save my life and my future children’s life and have a safe and healthy environment.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Federal legislation that would hold down the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans and nearly a quarter-million Wisconsin residents has quiet support from Republicans in the Senate, according to Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).
So far, however, none of them have spoken out, Baldwin said at a news conference in Madison on Friday.
Baldwin has introduced a bill that would extend tax credits that have cut the health insurance costs for people who buy coverage on the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov.
When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 and the HealthCare.gov marketplace was launched to make it easier and cheaper for people without health insurance to buy coverage, the law included tax credits to lower the cost of premiums for people with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty guideline.
In 2021, the premium tax credits were supercharged to impart far greater savings to people buying insurance through the marketplace. The enhanced tax credits were extended in 2022 with a sunset at the end of this year.
The extra tax breaks helped insurance coverage through the HealthCare.gov marketplace rise to record highs in the last few years, both in the U.S. and in Wisconsin.
“This tax break, the enhanced premium tax credit, saves more than 230,000 Wisconsinites an average of $500 every single month” on their insurance premiums, Baldwin said. “Not extending these tax breaks and jacking up costs on the open marketplace will crush families — but also small businesses that are the fabric of our communities.”
In January Baldwin and New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) introduced legislation to make the enhanced tax credits permanent, in place of the lower tax credits that will resume when the enhanced credits expire Dec. 31.
A paper published Sept. 3 by the Georgetown University Law School Center on Poverty and Inequality reported that according to the Congressional Budget Office, without the enhanced credits 30 million more people will lack health insurance by 2034 — an average of 3.8 million a year.
For people with incomes between 100% and 150% of the federal poverty guideline, insurance premiums will go up by 7.9% between 2026 and 2034, the Georgetown researchers calculated.
For people with incomes between 150% and 400% of the federal poverty guideline, premiums would rise between 29% and 160% in the same period, according to the report.
The report also notes without the enhanced tax credits, people who lose Medicaid coverage due to cuts in the Republican megabill President Donald Trump signed on July 4 could be unable to afford insurance on HealthCare.gov.
‘Encouraged by conversations’
“There are, in the Senate, Republicans who have quietly indicated that they want to extend breaks to make [HealthCare.gov] marketplace insurance affordable,” Baldwin said. “I don’t have a count yet to tell you that we have enough, but I’m encouraged by the conversations I’m having.”
In the U.S. House, a bipartisan bill has been introduced extending the enhanced credits for a year — “notably getting them past the midterm elections,” Baldwin said. But that’s not long enough for her.
“I don’t think this should be political,” Baldwin said. “I think this should be something that Democrats and Republicans should agree on, that people should be able to afford their health care coverage.”
Baldwin’s press conference was held at Access Community Health Center, which serves low-income Wisconsin residents. Joining Baldwin, Madison chef and restaurant owner Evan Dannells said that the passage of the ACA and the opening of the HealthCare.gov marketplace made health care newly available in his industry after years of the youngest group of workers going uninsured.
Before the ACA, for people who entered hospitality jobs in their late teens or early 20s, “it was essentially, fundamentally understood that you wouldn’t have health care until you were in your 30s,” Dannells said.
The ACA required insurers to cover young people on their parents’ plans up to the age of 26, then made it possible for them to find more affordable coverage at HealthCare.gov after that.
“I have a half dozen full time employees over the age of 26 at a restaurant, and so what they’re going to do is they’re going to leave for corporate jobs that have the buying power to get their premiums down,” Dannells said — something not possible for small employers.
“This is essentially the beginning of the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act with no plan and process for the future,” Dannells said.
Kyle LaFond, owner of a Middleton manufacturing firm that makes custom cosmetic products for celebrity brands, said the ACA and the HealthCare.gov was “a godsend” for small employers such as his company. “These subsidies are important because, of course, now more than ever, folks are living paycheck to paycheck,” he said.
Baldwin said she will campaign to attach her proposal to one of “several must-pass bills coming up in the days and the weeks ahead.”
Avoiding the ‘cliff’
While the enhancements increased the value of the tax credits for people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty guideline, they also made tax credits available for the first time to people with higher incomes — up to more than 1000% of the guideline.
Baldwin told the Wisconsin Examiner that those higher income groups were added to avoid “what we call a cliff.” That occurs when a person’s income rises even slightly above a benefit’s income ceiling — suddenly cutting off the benefit and possibly demanding they make a repayment. Many safety-net programs have cliffs, she explained.
In Wisconsin, most Medicaid programs have income limits, and many are only available to people with incomes up to the federal poverty guideline, she said. People who may work several part-time jobs and usually qualify for Medicaid can find themselves kicked off the program if they have a brief boost in their income, due to overtime work, for instance.
“Then you have to do all sorts of work to get back on, and then you have to be very mindful that you don’t get an extra hour or a raise” that could lead to being kicked off again, Baldwin said.
“So we were trying to avoid there being the sort of equivalent cliff in the Affordable Care Act marketplace tax credits,” Baldwin said.
For that reason, her bill would continue the tax credits available to the higher income population, she said, “and I would be committed to not reintroducing a cliff.”
Baldwin criticized GOP lawmakers for passing the Republican megabill that extended Trump’s 2017 tax cuts without considering an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.
“You would think including tax breaks for tens of millions of families to afford health care would be a centerpiece of that legislation. Right? Wrong,” Baldwin said.
Instead, she charged, the bill made cuts to Medicaid and the federal nutrition program SNAP to pay for tax cuts “in favor of the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans.”

SHOSHONE, Idaho — Just east of town, a road cuts through sagebrush and fields of cows toward Donley Farms, where Darren Taber manages the multigenerational operation. The Sawtooth Mountains rise in the distance, marking the northern edge of the Snake River Plain — the backdrop for Taber’s work.
As the Magic Valley wakes up, the 900-cow dairy is already in motion. Taber has owned Donley Farms for more than 25 years. These days, he focuses on crop and management decisions — planning pesticide spray schedules, overseeing planting and training the next generation of family farmers.
It’s demanding, unpredictable work – but for Taber, the farm is also home.
“It’s the best place in the world to raise a family,” he said. “It’s a lot of late nights. There’s a lot of times that I’m (working) 24-hour days. … If a milker doesn’t show up, guess what? You gotta go milk.”
Taber manages the operation with his son. But more and more, he has been pulled away from this work and into policy, traveling to Washington, D.C., to advocate for immigration reform that has been stalled for years.
“I have been there for the Goodlatte bill. I have been there for the Lofgren and Newhouse bill. I have been there for Sen. Crapo’s bill,” Taber said, ticking off more than six years’ worth of legislation intended to address immigration reform for agricultural employers and workers.



“What I cannot stand is the fact that Congress cannot get anything across the finish line,” he said. “Maybe we can’t solve it all in one big, beautiful bill. Who knows? Maybe we can.”
The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has left farmers worried about their livelihoods and workers frightened for their lives. It’s also renewed bipartisan calls to implement reforms for the people who help feed America.
“Yeah, get the criminals out,” Taber said. “But your farmworkers are not your criminals.”
President Donald Trump has indicated he might be amenable to a solution.
In June – after reports of raids at a New Mexico dairy, at a Nebraska meat production plant and in the fields of California – Trump took to social media and promised that “changes are coming” for “our great farmers” who are losing “very good, long time workers.”

The administration then ordered a pause on workplace raids in agriculture and hospitality, but reversed course days later.
Trump then said in a July 3 speech that he was working to help farmers who depend on migrant labor – indicating his administration was making progress on legislation to address the issue.
“We have a country to run,” he said, “and we wanna have them come in and we wanna have them help our farmers.”
Trump and other leaders have discussed a work program that would ensure farmers have the labor they need but would not provide amnesty for farmworkers who lack legal status.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has said the goal is a 100% American workforce and that reforms could include a shift toward automation or looking to the 34 million “able-bodied adults on Medicaid” as a way to fill labor needs, adding that deportations must be carried out strategically “so as not to compromise our food supply.”
Most farmworkers earn less than $40,000 annually. Nearly 70% of people working in agriculture were not born in the United States, according to federal data, and about 42% of that workforce lacks legal status.
Yet protections for workers without legal status are limited.
“During the pandemic, it was actually the first Trump administration that designated farmworkers essential,” said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesman for United Farm Workers. “Five years later, these same workers who we said were essential are now being treated as disposable.”
The H-2A visa is a temporary permit that allows farmers to hire foreign farmworkers if there aren’t enough domestic workers to fill labor needs — a growing reality for employers.
“We have not deferred to migrant labor or H-2A programs because we’re trying to save money,” said Andrew Mickelsen, partner of a large potato farm in Idaho Falls. “We’re doing it because that void is not filling up.”

In 2014, the U.S. issued around 90,000 H-2A visas. Last year, that number rose to 315,000.
Yet industries that require year-round labor, such as Idaho dairy, cannot legally hire workers using the temporary visa.
Since 2019, some members of Congress have been attempting to address these issues through legislation that would provide temporary legal status to agricultural workers.
The latest version of the bill, introduced in May, would allow a qualified individual with extended employment in farmwork to become a “certified agricultural worker” on the condition of continued employment.
The bill would also provide at least 20,000 H-2A visas each year for the next decade for farmers with year-round labor needs. Half of those visas would be reserved for the dairy industry.
Similar legislation has twice passed the U.S. House with bipartisan support but then died in the U.S. Senate, noted Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who is co-sponsoring the bill.
“We are reaching out to our Senate friends on a bipartisan basis to encourage them to move this bill forward,” Lofgren told News21.
News21 also contacted Republican Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington – all co-sponsors of the current bill. None responded to requests for comment.

Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economics expert at Michigan State University, said the bill’s pathway to legal status may be what’s holding it back.
“It’s hard to get bipartisan support when you’re talking about legalizing hundreds of thousands of unauthorized workers – especially in our current political climate,” Rutledge said.
Other bills look to expand H-2A flexibility, create a temporary status for those who’ve been in the U.S. for years, and implement E-Verify nationwide, but labor advocates say reforms must also guarantee higher wages, better working conditions and union rights.

Given that immigrants play an important role across many sectors of the country’s economy, tension between business interests and those who support mass deportations is growing.
“We understand the need for enforcement,” said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association. “But we also have to have a conversation around immigration reform so that we don’t damage our economy.”
 In Idaho, immigration enforcement tensions rise

Stephanie Mickelsen was at her home in Idaho Falls when her sons started calling and texting. Immigration agents had arrived at one of her farms.
It was Jan. 24, three days after Ryan Spoon, vice chair of the Ada County Republican Committee, accused Mickelsen on social media of hiring illegal workers and said he had contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Her operation, Mickelsen Farms, is one of the largest potato producers in the region.
Agents detained one immigrant employee that day, but Mickelsen, a sixth-generation farmer and Republican state representative, said the incident served as a warning for anyone speaking out against immigration enforcement.
“I became more fearful of actually standing up and just trying to have honest, earnest debate,” she said.
Last year, as the Idaho House considered legislation to allow local law enforcement to arrest immigrants in the state without authorization, Mickelsen noted that businesses all across Idaho likely employ such immigrants.

“If you guys think that you haven’t been touched by an illegal immigrant’s hands in some way, through either your traveling or your food, you’re kidding yourselves,” she said during floor debate. “We have people here that provide great value to our communities and to our society.”
Agriculture is the backbone of Idaho’s economy, contributing some $37 billion in sales in 2022, according to a University of Idaho report – mainly from farms spread out across the 400-milelong Snake River Plain in the southern part of the state.

Warm days, cool nights and abundant sunshine create ideal growing conditions for a wide range of crops, especially potatoes, of which Idaho leads the nation in production.
From the Idaho Potato Museum in Blackfoot to a potato-shaped mascot named Spuddy Buddy and even holding a potato drop on New Year’s Eve, Idaho has fully leaned into its spud reputation.
While potatoes remain the icon, the dairy industry has quietly overtaken crops as the top agricultural sector by revenue, generating just under $11 billion in annual sales from over 300 dairy farms and around 700,000 cows, according to the Idaho Dairymen’s Association.
Today, Idaho ranks fourth in the nation for milk production, with dairy farms heavily concentrated in the Magic Valley – home to Taber’s farm. The industry has become a cultural staple in its own right, one that’s celebrated each summer at Dairy Days.
Idaho’s dairy industry relies on a labor force that comes primarily from Mexico, said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the dairymen’s association.
“When you (have) a workforce that’s 90% foreign born, and you don’t have access to a visa program, you can guess how dependent we are on an unauthorized workforce,” he said.
From both his office in Twin Falls and the halls of Congress, Naerebout has worked for decades with other dairy leaders in support of immigration reform. The goal is twofold: to secure legal status for existing workers, and to gain access to the H-2A visa program to meet labor demands.
After 20 years, Naerebout said, the needle has barely moved. If the issue isn’t addressed, he added, the ripple effect will be felt across the supply chain, increasing the price of dairy products.
“We can’t feed ourselves as a country if we don’t find a solution to this problem,” Naerebout said. “For our dairy producers … their business livelihood depends on it.”
The absence of immigration reform and a declining domestic workforce have contributed to a labor shortage across Idaho agriculture, according to Naerebout.
“There’s not an interest, and when there is an interest, there’s not the grit to stay in the job and actually see it through,” he said.

Naerebout pointed to data shared with him by an H-2A contractor. Last season, the contractor advertised for 6,000 positions. Just 35 domestic applications were submitted. Of the 35, 12 people were willing to be interviewed. Two were eventually hired, but neither made it to harvest.
Mickelsen Farms needs around 125 temporary workers to harvest several thousand acres, but it typically receives just one or two domestic applications. Andrew Mickelsen, who runs the operation alongside his mother and other relatives, said the company used to get by without using H-2A workers. Now they’re reliant on them.
“If we did not have the H-2A program, there would be no way for us to get our harvest done,” he said.
Mickelsen Farms insists it does what is required of any employer across the country when hiring workers: Collect I-9 and W-4 forms, and trust that workers’ documents are valid.
Recently, the Mickelsens have become even more vigilant in the hiring process, but they said there’s a line farmers can’t cross.
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an employer cannot reject valid documents, request additional ones or treat someone differently based on perceived immigration status or national origin. Doing so can open the employer up to legal penalties under federal law.
Stephanie Mickelsen said there’s a growing expectation that employers police workers’ legal status. She and other farmers disagree.
“You’re making bad guys out of employers who have followed the law,” she said. “Don’t make us your enforcer. Do your job.”
Aside from that January morning at Mickelsen Farms, there have been few reports of immigration raids in the state, but Mickelsen believes enforcement actions are happening quietly. According to a New York Times analysis, ICE arrests in Idaho are up a whopping 924% from last year — the highest percentage change in the nation.
“I think that there are raids going on; I think that everybody is trying to keep it really, really quiet,” she said. “I know people that are being served with I-9 audit requests. … I know that they’ve picked up people and removed people right and left, up and down this valley.
“But nobody’s talking about it,” she said, “because they’re all afraid.”
 In California, farmworkers continue to toil

As the sun rises over the golden hills of California’s Salinas Valley, the region’s 25,000 farmworkers are already hunched at the waist, planting and harvesting America’s produce.
At one operation off a two-lane road dotted with farm stands, a worker gathers cauliflower, a pouch of rubber bands hooked to his belt. Bands snake up his arm, and when he reaches into the pouch to resupply his stack, some scatter on the soil beneath his feet.
Most of his fellow farmworkers have their faces covered with wide-brimmed hats or bandannas to protect their skin from the sun. Within the first three hours of their shift, the temperature will climb by nearly 30 degrees.

The worker, S.H., emigrated from Hidalgo, Mexico, about 15 years ago. He requested anonymity because he, like most of his co-workers, is in the U.S. without legal status, and the fear looms that ICE officers could appear at any time.
“You don’t feel safe anywhere,” he said. “In the morning, you wake up and pray to God and say, ‘Let’s put ourselves in God’s hands, because he is the only one who decides.’”
S.H. is one of about 10 employees at an organic operation nestled in the fertile soil of San Benito County, a part of the “Salad Bowl of the World.”
California’s $58 billion agriculture industry supplies over a third of the nation’s vegetables and the majority of America’s fruits and nuts.
The state has the largest number of immigrants lacking legal status in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, and is home to about half of the unauthorized agricultural worker population, statistics show.
It is also a key target for carrying out Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
Since January, agents have raided farms in Santa Maria, Oxnard and Bakersfield, according to media outlets. ICE reports over 600 arrests in the state, though a New York Times analysis puts that number at about 5,800.
In early June, Trump deployed several thousand troops to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests. And in early July, a farmworker died from injuries sustained fleeing agents who raided two cannabis farms in Carpinteria and Camarillo. About 360 other workers were arrested.
Tom Homan, who serves as Trump’s “border czar,” has set daily arrest goals in the thousands. Farmers, workers and advocates worry that could cripple the state’s labor force.
“If you’re arresting a farmworker at a gas station or at a church or dropping your kid off at school, that’s still a farmworker who’s being picked up,” said De Loera-Brust, the United Farm Workers spokesman. “That’s still a farmworker who’s not going to be able to go to work the next day.”

“America would not be as great as it is now if all my workforce were taken away,” he said.
Lawmakers, he said, “need to wake up and they need to do something. And it needs to be done quickly – before it’s too late.”
M.M., her shirt damp with sweat and dew from an early morning of harvesting cauliflower at another farm, works without legal permission so she can support her daughter and son.
She’s been in the U.S. for 15 years. But now, she worries when she sends her children off to school that it will be the last time she sees them. They’re getting therapy to cope with the fear that their mother may not come home.
“We don’t know when they could detain us,” M.M. said. “Or they could come right here to work.”
Nearly every day, she hears about ICE’s presence near her home or the farm where she’s employed. She said she leaves the house only to go to work but knows other migrants have stopped working altogether.
“In the fields, they are running out of people,” she said. “There is a lot of fruit that is rotting.”
Each morning, she’s up before dawn, preparing for another eight-hour day dedicated to weeding, planting and harvesting.
“I’m still afraid due to the uncertainty of being deported,” she said. “But, oh well. We have to keep working and move forward.”

Kevin Stitt gives his State of the State Address in the House chamber of the state Capitol on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Editor’s note: Parts of this column contain graphic depictions of domestic violence.
It’s become clear two systems of justice exist in Oklahoma : one that caters to the good ol’ boys, and another for everyone else.
The good ol’ boy network features Republican officials shielding each other from the types of scrutiny that would get an everyday person skewered in the court of public opinion, fired from their job or thrown in jail.
Let’s take the case of state Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee. For months, people at the highest levels of government kept silent about the fact that he was accused of not one, but two, separate and horrific attacks on his own family. 
In April, Burns used his pickup to chase a vehicle carrying two of his family members, according to court documents. He ran them into a ditch, injuring both occupants. In a second incident, Burns tried to gouge out his wife’s eye the Pawnee County Sheriff’s Office learned while investigating the roadway assaults. His wife’s injuries forced her to miss a week of work, according to court records.
To their credit, the Pawnee County Sheriff’s Office appears to have swiftly investigated both attacks, collecting recorded interviews and a video depicting Burns’ terrifying chase. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was called in, as was a child welfare specialist from the Department of Human Services.
But then, things were hushed up. The OSBI didn’t file the findings of their investigation with the court until Aug. 27. Burns was never arrested or charged with a crime for over four months.
Pawnee County District Attorney Mike Fisher himself recused from the matter, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Attorney General Gentner Drummond suddenly decided to step in. At some point, Burns hired his Republican colleague, state Rep. Chris Kannady, an attorney who is listed on his state House bio as “counselor to the Speaker,” to represent him. Kannady is also a donor to Drummond’s gubernatorial campaign. Burns hasn’t donated to Drummond, but either directly or via his campaign, he has donated to over two dozen seated House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, according to ethics filings.
Meanwhile, Burns got to go about his life in state government as if nothing happened — for months. 
He continued voting on legislation, including House Bill 1273, which is now law. It shortens the time some people convicted in domestic abuse cases have to spend time in classes to curb their behavior from 52 weeks to 26.
In his veto message, attempting to block the passage of the law, Gov. Kevin Stitt wrote it “will make it easier for abusers to sidestep meaningful consequences and avoid jail time with less effort. This isn’t meaningful reform — it’s a concession to abusers, and it puts victims at greater risk.”
By that late May vote, Burns knew he was under criminal investigation. But rather than recusing himself because of a clear conflict of interest, he was one of the 89 House lawmakers who voted to overturn Stitt’s veto.
They were successful, and no one said a word about Burns’ case as they weakened consequences for abusers.
In August, Drummond’s office finally got around to prosecuting the matter, disclosing in a press release after-the-fact that Burns had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse and assault. In a highly unusual move, Burns was allowed to plead guilty the same day he was charged, sparing him months of deserved public scrutiny during continued court appearances.
Burns received a one-year suspended sentence, and then was allowed to use House media resources — funded by you and me — to put out a statement justifying the plea, in which he noted he’s begun a 52-week batterers intervention program — you know, that same program he championed shortening for other abusers beginning Nov. 1.
Fellow Republicans Drummond and House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, meanwhile, gave Burns the equivalent of a metaphorical pat on the back following his plea, both condemning his violence, but praising him for taking responsibility.
Neither man demanded that he resign. And while state law doesn’t actually require a lawmaker to resign unless they’re convicted of a felony, it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t.
Elected officials should be held to a higher standard because if recent history is any judge, we know they’re not willing to hold each other to one.
Former House Rep. Dean Davis, R-Broken Arrow, whose campaign Burns donated to, was censured and briefly removed from all committees by the state House following a 2023 arrest for public intoxication in Oklahoma City. Body cam footage showed Dean, who later pleaded no contest to the charge, arguing with officers and saying he was immune from prosecution because he was a lawmaker. 
But he was allowed to be immediately reinstated to those committees when he publicly apologized. Voters later booted him themselves.
And Drummond tossed out a case against former House Majority Whip Terry O’Donnell, R-Catoosa, that involved allegations that he ran a bill allowing his wife to be appointed as a state tag agent. Drummond said at the time that the reason he dismissed the case wasn’t because he thought O’Donnell was blameless, but because he believed he was unfairly “targeted.”
Republican lawmakers though had no problem targeting former state Rep. Mauree Turner, the nation’s first nonbinary legislator, after a protester went to the Democrat’s office following an altercation with the state’s Highway Patrol. Turner, who is also Black and Muslim, was never charged with a crime, but that didn’t stop Republican legislators from censuring and stripping Turner of all committees for an imaginary House made up charge of “harboring a fugitive.” Republicans said Turner would be reinstated after apologizing. Turner never did, and later said the vote was a symbolic reminder to marginalized Oklahomans that they don’t belong.  
In Burns’ case, it wasn’t until Stitt and state Republican Party Chair Charity Linch demanded he resign that the 46-year-old actually did so. But that resignation won’t be effective until next month.
Burns said he still wants to complete an interim study at the Capitol on post traumatic stress disorders and doesn’t plan to step down until that’s done. And apparently his good ol’ buddies are going to allow him that final gesture of respect.
He doesn’t deserve that.
Lawmakers should not reward people who try to gouge out their spouse’s eyes or run people  off the road.
GOP chair Linch wrote in a statement that “the ‘good old boy’ system concealing nefarious behavior should no longer be tolerated in Oklahoma.”
Maybe the good ol’ boys can live up to that apparent Republican ideal next time one of their buddies breaks the law.

Wyoming needs to pay teachers more to retain and recruit the best, educators tell lawmakers. 
The post Teacher salary, class size, school counselors come into focus as recalibration advances appeared first on WyoFile .","In Sheridan County School District 3, which serves schools in the tiny community of Clearmont, the base pay for a first-year teacher is $48,000. But the median home price in the community, Superintendent Chase Chris​tensen said, is over $400,000.
“I believe that a couple that are both involved in education should be able to make a living to a point where they can raise a family, buy a house in the community they live in,” said Chris​tensen, who noted that he also serves as special ed director, tech director, principal and part-time bus driver for Wyoming’s second-smallest district. 
He urged lawmakers to increase teacher pay Friday during the Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration meeting in Casper. For too long, educators have been underpaid, and it will hurt the state, he said. 
“I urge you not to be guided by what has been done before, or by practices that have taken advantage of a group of professionals for far too long,” Christensen said. “Instead, I invite you to step out and set a base rate of pay that you believe is respectful of the profession, that is right, that will help recruit and retain the best, and that will drive our state’s economy for generations.” 
A base salary of $70,000 better reflects the preparation, skill and responsibility required by the job, he concluded. “I recognize that this represents a significant increase, but our students are worth the investment.”
As lawmakers waded through the preliminary findings of consultants tasked with assessing Wyoming’s educational funding model last week, the need to pay teachers better was a recurring theme.
Pay is one of the myriad components being assessed by the ongoing recalibration process. The Legislature’s exhaustive and tedious assessment of public education funding is mandated every five years. 
This time, however, lawmakers are doing so in the shadow of a district court ruling that the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. They are also doing so in an age when many legislators are seeking government spending cuts. 
Preliminary findings 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
To do that, the state’s consultants, Picus, Odden and Associates, are holding meetings with Wyoming educators, analyzing data and making recommendations over the course of several months.

The consultants, who have been working through the assessment since early summer, presented their preliminary findings to the committee Thursday and Friday. Amid the minutiae and acronym-heavy language of education, several issues emerged as topics of high interest for educators and lawmakers. They include teacher retention, school resource officers, school nutrition programs, transportation needs and technology.
Many of those issues overlap with areas identified in the February court decision on school funding. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.
In his 186-page order, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers have failed as well to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled.
Consultants don’t yet have salary recommendations; they plan to dig into that topic during the next meeting in October, consultant Dr. Larry Picus said. 
However, in terms of the court-required elementary school mental health counselors, Picus said, it appears Wyoming’s 2025 “evidence-based model” for funding already meets that. That model, he said, funds one core counselor per prototypical elementary school (288 students), plus counselors for struggling students. The additional cost is $13 million.
Discussions of other court-identified areas led lawmakers to seek more details, answers or information. That included the costs, models and benefits of school resource officers; caps on school reserve accounts; and how much general fund money districts are spending on nutrition programs.
“This is a terribly important issue,” Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said about school nutrition. “It’s something that we need to get right, and do it right, and so I think there’s still a great deal of work that needs to be done on this particular issue.”

Technology in schools — such as providing computers to every student — also generated questions. Aside from salary levels, Picus said, this topic was the top thing identified as not adequately funded by the state’s model. 
The annual cost of a computer per pupil, Picus estimated, is $215. But when you add in hardware, technical assistance and other related costs, it bumps up to nearly $500 a student. 
Sen. Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, pushed back on the assumption that giving every student a computer is essential. 
“My question regarding computers is, ‘Where is the evidence?’” Biteman asked. “Where’s the evidence that shows that having each kid have a Chromebook, in this case, rather than a textbook, produces better outcomes for the students? I’m just not seeing the evidence.”
The data he’s found, he said, actually links heavy computer use with worse outcomes. 
“So I really want to see the evidence before we go down this rabbit hole that the judge sent us on,” Biteman said, adding that to do so would be inefficient and expensive. “Just because it feels good to a judge doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s what’s best for our kids.”
Teacher pay 
Though consultants were not prepared to present on teacher pay, Picus did suggest Wyoming pay its substitute teachers more — up to about $300 a day. 
And teacher pay still came up. Many of the district superintendents and administrators at the meeting at least touched on how the high cost of living and low salaries have made attracting and keeping teachers more difficult.
“When we talk about, what does it cost for someone in Teton County to actually live in Teton County, we can’t pay enough right now,” said Kristen Mayo, Teton County School District 1’s executive director of resources. She recognized her county is an anomaly and said that while the district and local communities have launched separate initiatives to address the issue, it’s still a serious problem. Owning a home is virtually impossible, she said, and renting is becoming increasingly out of reach.

“Really, at the end of the day, I would say we need more money in our salaries, just so our teachers can live in Teton County, in the community that they work in,” she said. 
Sheridan County School District 1 Superintendent Jeff Jones said salary increases will have a direct impact on the quality of educators in a state struggling to fill positions.
“If things improve with salaries here, we’re going to see a different salary pool,” he said. “Not just in numbers of people, but the quality of people is going to change as well.”
Consultants plan to hold more in-person listening sessions with educators around Wyoming before the next committee meeting, scheduled for Oct. 28-29 in Casper.

State and coal industry officials want a new 440 million ton coal tract offered for sale, but opponents warn lease won't benefit public coffers like years past.
The post Wyoming’s massive new federal coal tract not likely to draw high bids appeared first on WyoFile .","WRIGHT—What’s the value of a new 440 million ton federal coal tract in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin mining district in today’s market?
Pretty low, according to some Powder River Basin coal producers and those familiar with the industry.
Yes, Antelope coal mine operator Navajo Transitional Energy Company would like to add more tonnage to its legally mineable coal reserve, Technical Services Manager Blake Jones told WyoFile. But only if the price is right. 
Another Powder River Basin coal producer and, conceivably, a potential competitive bidder, CORE Natural Resources, told federal officials that today’s fair-market value for the coal is far below past bids and valuations in the region.
“Even though the [Trump] administration is working hard to improve the market, it will take some time to dig out of the current hole,” CORE’s Thunder Basin Coal Co. Manager of Environmental Affairs Jamie Olson told U.S. Bureau of Land Management officials on Wednesday.
“For that reason,” Olson said, “the fair-market value of coal in the Powder River Basin will remain soft for the next number of years.” The BLM should give “little weight” to past coal tract valuations, she added.

Olson was among about a dozen who attended the federal agency’s public meeting here — a step in the BLM’s expedited action on the West Antelope III coal lease-by-application project. The BLM resurrected the 10-year-old lease request in July after years of limbo due to a lack of interest on behalf of NTEC and a Biden-era leasing moratorium in the basin. The 440 million ton federal coal tract spans some 3,500 acres in Campbell and Converse counties. The intent of the meeting, according to the BLM, was to gather public comment regarding “the project’s fair-market value and maximum economic recovery.”
Though companies like NTEC and CORE suggested the fair-market value is much lower than comparable coal tracts in the past, they — along with other industry supporters — suggest the real value is not entirely wrapped up in the purchase price, but in the various taxes that apply once the coal is leased and mined, as well as the jobs and lucrative mining service industry sector that the massive coal tract would support.
“The other part of the fair-market value is the job component,” Wyoming Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti told WyoFile. “You’re keeping companies operating, you’re keeping the resource under development and you keep people employed, and that’s part of the fair return.”
Conservation groups, however, worry the BLM, under pressure from the Trump administration’s Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry executive orders, might be tempted to undervalue the coal tract. Even if it is sold, they doubt whether a coal company can line up enough buyers for the estimated 20-25 years it would take to mine the coal.
“The thing that is really frustrating is that the federal government is going out of its way to throw lifelines to the private coal industry,” Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Climate and Energy Organizer Emma Jones told WyoFile.

Jones noted that even if a coal company offers a successful bid to buy the federal coal tract, Wyoming stands to earn less revenue from mining it. That’s because a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill reduced the federal royalty rate for coal from 12.5% to 7% — an estimated $50 million annual revenue loss to Wyoming coffers. Wyoming lawmakers this year also reduced the state’s severance tax rate for surface-mined coal from 6.5% to 6% — an estimated revenue loss of about $10 million in 2026 and potentially lower each year afterward, if coal production continues to decline, according to state figures. 
“It makes it even less clear how this is actually going to be beneficial to Wyoming,” Jones said. “If the only way to keep this industry alive is for the federal government to basically give away coal for free, how does that make any sense?”
Cash cow goes to slaughter
The decades-long march of coal shovels in the Powder River Basin has required continuous access to new tracts of coal, most of which are owned by the federal government and managed by the BLM. In that time, the agency refined a federal coal “lease by application” process specific to the basin and subject to the National Environmental Policy Act to weigh the environmental and socioeconomic implications for each leasing action.

To obtain the right to mine federal coal, a qualifying operator typically nominates a specified tract of coal. If approved, the operator makes an offer in a competitive, sealed-bid lease sale. The tract goes to the highest bid if it meets the BLM’s undisclosed fair-market value for the coal tract.
Winning “bonus bids” ranged from 11 cents-per-ton to 38 cents-per-ton in the 1990s, according to federal data. Bids then crept up more than $1 in the 2010s — the height of competition for new federal coal tracts here. 
There’s a lot of coal in each tract, so a bonus bid payment typically amounts to tens of millions of dollars, and the money is split between the federal treasury and the state where the coal is mined. Federal coal tracts in the basin began selling for more than $100 million in the 1990s and topped out in 2012 with a 721 million ton tract that sold for $793 million, going to the North Antelope Rochelle mine.
During his tenure, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal commonly encouraged Powder River Basin coal companies to bid vigorously, noting the enormous revenue coal bonus bids provided to the state — most of which was dedicated to K-12 school capital construction. From 1992 to 2012, coal bonus bid payments generated some $5.4 billion, about half of which went to Wyoming.
But that all began to change about 10 years ago with a shrinking coal market and a series of coal company bankruptcies.
Flipping the switch
Cloud Peak Energy, which owned and operated three mines in the basin, including the Antelope mine, nominated the 440 million ton West Antelope III federal coal tract in 2015, and the BLM initiated the leasing and environmental review process. But the company went bankrupt in 2019 and the mines were eventually sold to NTEC. The company, for years, didn’t ask the BLM to reinitiate the leasing process, but mulled it over more after the election of Donald Trump, according to NTEC’s Blake Jones.

It was the BLM that approached NTEC just days after the One Big Beautiful Bill passed in July, he said, adding that the company is considering taking on the tract.
While NTEC weighs the risks and benefits, Wyoming officials are cheering the BLM’s swift action to put the tract up for bid.
“In today’s electric power demand market and economy, and in consideration of the current and future national power generation need alone, this leasing action should move forward through the [environmental impact statement] and Record of Decision process, based on a fair market value assessment,” Wyoming Energy Authority’s Director of Fossil Fuel Development Kyle Wendtland told BLM officials.
In fact, Wendtland worked for Cloud Peak Energy when it initiated the West Antelope III coal lease-by-application in 2015, he said.
“So I’m pretty familiar with this lease,” Wendtland told BLM officials. “I therefore feel it is important to speak to the facts when discussing or commenting on a mineral leasing action. First and foremost, ensuring that Wyoming and the nation have an uninterrupted, adequate and competitively priced coal-fuel supply based on accurate valuation has never been more important.”
The BLM is moving quickly on the lease.
After restarting the process in July, the BLM published a Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project on Aug. 15. It includes two alternatives: to deny the West Antelope III coal lease-by-application or to offer it for competitive lease sale.Go to the BLM National NEPA Register for additional information and planning documents.

Efforts by Wyoming politicians at the state and national levels to transfer or sell federal land left guest columnist Earl DeGroot wondering whether officially recognizing the day was meaningless.
The post Was Wyoming Public Lands Day legislation meaningless? appeared first on WyoFile .","In 2018 and 2019, I joined many others in promoting legislation calling for the designation of a Wyoming Public Lands Day on the last Saturday in September. We testified at various committees in favor of the bill, which took two years to pass. 

Opinion

Recent efforts by Wyoming politicians at the state and national levels to transfer or sell federal land make me wonder whether the Public Lands Day bill was meaningless. Our elected officials continue to take action contrary to the spirit of the legislation and the wishes of their constituents.
Our politicians have a long history of ignoring public opinion on this issue. That history dates back at least to the 1970s, when the Wyoming Legislature attempted to force the transfer of federal land. But let’s start with something more recent. 
In 2016, a constitutional amendment was proposed that would have paved the way for federal land to be transferred to Wyoming. Sponsors dubiously claimed the amendment prohibited the state from selling the transferred land. Public land advocates were not convinced. Many believed it was the first step toward privatization. I joined more than a hundred people to testify in Cheyenne in opposition. The proposed amendment was withdrawn shortly thereafter. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Senate Joint Resolution 2, sponsored by Republican Sen. Bob Ide of Casper and co-sponsored by 13 others, called for the transfer of all federal land in Wyoming to the state except Yellowstone Park. Bill supporters erroneously claimed the U.S. Constitution doesn’t allow the federal government to own large quantities of land. Reminders that the Legislative Service Office had issued a legal opinion to the contrary did not dissuade them. 
Promoters of the resolution also ignored the findings of a 2016 study commissioned by the Legislature to determine the feasibility of transferring management of federal lands to the State. The resulting report by Y2 Consultants recommended against transfer largely because the state couldn’t afford to manage millions of acres of federal land. Nevertheless, the dislike for the federal government among supporters of the resolution was so strong that they were willing to ignore the recommendations of the study as well as the legal opinion of their own attorneys. Furthermore, they were willing to trample on the wishes of thousands of Wyoming citizens. I watched in dismay as numerous legislators tried to outdo each other as they attacked federal land ownership. The bill was defeated in the Senate by only one vote. 
Just a few months ago, attacks on our federal land came at the national level. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, proposed an amendment to the congressional budget reconciliation bill that would require the sale of millions of acres of federal land. In many respects, the proposed amendment was worse than state efforts to transfer federal land. At least with the transfer, there was a dim hope that the land would remain public. Lee’s amendment was withdrawn after intense nationwide opposition, including numerous well-attended public protests in Wyoming. 
With great consternation and considerable anger, I watched all three of Wyoming’s congressional delegation back Lee’s efforts, or at least do nothing to stop them. Sen. John Barrasso said, “I support federal land sales when they serve the interests of states, local communities and the public.” Sen. Cynthia Lummis said, “The federal government doesn’t need to perpetually own every piece of land.” Rep. Harriet Hageman voted for a similar proposal in the House of Representatives.
Clearly, Barrasso, Lummis, and Hageman are out of touch with how important federal lands are to the lifestyle of Wyoming residents. Many of us live here solely because of the access to federal land. We don’t want even ONE ACRE sold or transferred!
I am increasingly frustrated by politicians who are less than friendly to our public land. Even more frustrating and perplexing is the fact that so many anti-federal land politicians are elected to office. On the one hand, there is strong public support for federal land, and on the other hand, anti-federal land politicians are elected and re-elected. I can only surmise that public land supporters are not doing their due diligence when vetting candidates. 
This needs to stop! Please join me in my commitment to vet candidates more carefully. If they don’t voice strong support for federal land, don’t vote them in! And if they have already taken action against federal land, vote them out!
In the meantime, let’s enjoy Wyoming Public Lands Day on Sept. 27. History tells us we must never take our federal lands for granted! They are constantly under threat.

(Courtesy of Jackie Augustine/Audubon of Kansas) LINCOLN – Supporters of the Niobrara River are contesting claims made by a local official about the status of federal funding and programs for managing the river and its environs as a congressionally designated scenic river.
The Friends of the Niobrara — a successor organization to one that stopped the Norden Dam project on the river — said in a recent press release that Mike Murphy, general manager of the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District, was spreading inaccurate information about that status of support and programs by the National Park Service.
Murphy, when contacted by the Examiner, mostly contested the claims, saying that he had been taken out of context to some extent.
The exchange comes as a state legislative committee prepares to hold an interim study hearing Sept. 19 on whether the State of Nebraska should replace the Park Service as the lead manager of the Niobrara.
The federal government does allow such state management in rare instances, but 34 years ago, when Congress designated 76 miles of the river in north-central Nebraska as a federal national wild and scenic river, the National Park Service was put in charge of preserving its natural beauty.


Interim study hearing
The Sept. 19 interim study hearing at the State Capitol in Lincoln by the Legislature’s Natural Resources Commission will involve invited testimony only, leading to concerns by the Friends of the Niobrara, and other river supporters, that their voices won’t be heard.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, the committee’s chairman, said that there may be some confusion about the purpose of an interim study, which is to gather information and not necessarily to hear from a long line of public testifiers.
The hearing will be limited to five testifiers, said State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, who introduced the study resolution to transfer management to the state.
She said Thursday that she is hoping that a representative of the National Park Service will testify, but has been told that the federal agency is unable to comment on pending policy or legislation.


That stretch of the Niobrara is one of Nebraska’s most popular tourist destinations, drawing upwards of 75,000 visitors a year for float trips and sight-seeing. The Friends group feels that replacing the Park Service with local management would diminish the visitor experience, hurt tourism, and could lead to the delisting of the Niobrara as a federal scenic river.
“Ultimately we’re concerned that the state doesn’t have the resources to handle the scenic river designation,” said Kim Stuhr, president of the Friends of the Niobrara, citing the state’s current budget shortfalls.
Murphy, a key supporter of shifting management locally, told the Examiner that one of the key purposes of the Sept. 19 interim study hearing by the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee is to discover what responsibilities the state and local entities would be taking on if it took over management of the river. He said it’s a subject worth pursuing, given the federal cuts in spending on Park Service activities.
Murphy added that the current relationship between the Park Service and a local advisory council, the Niobrara Council (of which Murphy is a member), is not working.
“To me, this hearing is bringing out the good and bad and will shed light on what is going on,” he said.
The Park Service was designated to manage the Niobrara Scenic River when it was established in 1991. Utilizing an annual budget of $1.2 million, it operates a visitors center in Valentine, monitors water quantity and quality, provides law enforcement staff, and facilitates several educational and cultural programs. In addition, it helps landowners plan proper bank stabilization projects and paid for a recent canoe landing at Smith Falls State Park.
The Park Service had also been providing $100,000 a year to the Niobrara Council for its activities, which included maintaining toilets along the river, trash removal, camps for youth and funding two employees at a Niobrara Council office in Valentine.
But due to a freeze on funding by the Trump administration, the last funds given to the Council was $80,000 in May 2024.
The Niobrara Council – which is intended to be an outlet for local landowners and organizations to provide input to the Park Service – responded by laying off one employee and having its executive director go part time.

The Council gets about $52,000 a year from the State of Nebraska to operate, and has continued to hold regular meetings to provide input. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, this summer, agreed to pick up the maintenance and trash pickup duties, but the loss of federal funding has been a major complaint of some on the Council.
To be sure, there’s been on-and-off tension between local landowners and the Park Service since the scenic river designation.
The Park Service’s mission is to keep the Niobrara as wild and scenic as possible, by discouraging cabin and campground development along the river that could spoil the view and character of the river, which two years ago became the first location in North America designated as an international “quiet trail.”
Landowners and canoe outfitters, meanwhile, seek to build cabins and canoe launches for the visitors, development that can conflict with scenic river goals.
The most recent clash involves a recent story in the Valentine Midland News, in which Murphy was quoted saying the Niobrara Council has been operating “without any funding” for the past two years and that the visitors center in Valentine is slated to close, and the Park Service superintendent eliminated, when a lease on the center ends at the end of 2026.
Murphy, in the article, also questioned what federal money was spent on, besides salaries and vehicles.
“Some explanation of what their $1.5 million to $2 million budget pays for and goes for, besides personnel, vehicles, etc., would be beneficial,” he was quoted as saying.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Friends, in a press release entitled “Separating Fact from Fiction,” said that Murphy, as a long-time member of the Niobrara Council, ought to know how the Park Service money is spent given that there are regular briefings at meetings about their activities, which range from youth education and natural resources protection to public access and safety.
The press release also said the Valentine visitors center was not closing and that the federal government is seeking to renew the lease.
George Johnson, who leases the visitors center to the Park Service, said that the five-year lease on the building runs out in December 2026 but that he’s been told by Park Service officials that the lease is expected to be extended.

The Friends also said a new cooperative agreement with the Niobrara Council will be negotiated as soon as a new federal budget is adopted, which would restore funding and lead to the hiring of a new superintendent. Current Superintendent Susan Cook is retiring in October.
“At a time when the region faces mounting political and environmental pressures, the National Park Service has provided steady leadership, local engagement, and meaningful investment,” the Friends of the Niobrara said. The statement added that “Nebraskans deserve clarity—not confusion” prior to the hearing.
Murphy, asked about the press release, said he wasn’t “saying if I said that or not” concerning the closing of the visitors center. But the bottom line is, he said, is “we don’t know what the future holds” about future federal support for the scenic river.
What is known, Murphy said, is that the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE had earmarked the visitors center for closing earlier this year, until that decision was reversed, and that the current lease on the center runs out in a year.
“That’s the only thing we know,” he said, adding that he’d like to hear from Park Service officials at the September hearing.
Murphy added that he recalls only one detailed briefing about Park Service spending since he’s been on the Council, and that was several years ago.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Mark your calendars, everyone in Eastern Montana, for 5 p.m., Sept. 9 – Rep. Troy Downing will bestow on his constituency his fourth “telephone town hall” since he took office in January.
If you don’t follow his Facebook page – doesn’t everyone? – you may have missed it. But then, again, he sends out a recorded telephone “blast” just before it starts. But, best to sign up in advance.
Downing is in full re-election mode after recently receiving Donald Trump’s “complete and total endorsement” in no small part because he has been a complete and total acolyte for the president’s direct orders to the House GOP. It’s unknown if he has any opposing or varying views of the administration’s unlimited power grab to re-create American government and life in so many ways.
While decrying federal spending, Downing belittles concern for the projected increase of $3.4 trillion to the federal budget deficit as a result of the presidentially renamed “Working Families Tax Cut,” née “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The Congressional Budget Office projects an “increase over the next decade (2025-2034), with total national debt rising by $4.1 trillion when accounting for interest costs,” according to a July analysis.
Right now, Downing is crowing on national conservative cable channels about his sponsorship of H.J.R. 104, a Congressional Review Act, leading to overturning a Biden-era limit on Powder River Basin coal extraction. The resolution, passed on a four-vote margin, does not have the effect of law; it is only a sentiment of the House GOP majority but sets the tone. It has moved to the Senate for consideration into the eager hands of Montana’s two U.S. senators. 
Without mentioning U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke of the western district as co-sponsor, Downing rests his laurels on a claim Thursday that his legislative moxie “protects approximately $46 million in annual state revenue which is used to fund public K-12 education.” But is that true? 
The portion of the Coal Severance Tax Trust Fund he may have in mind is a school facilities fund that “may be used only for school facility projects authorized by the Legislature,” according to the Legislative Fiscal Division. This fund is the only one of seven sub-fund trusts, the others not related to public education.
Perhaps we can get clarification Tuesday evening?
He brags that 13,000 people were registered to be on the line for the first two calls. Adding another 6,500 from the third telephone call, we can estimate that 19,500 persons “attended” the three calls. With perhaps 12 people having opportunity to ask a question, that leaves 19,464 constituents who couldn’t and are still waiting. 
He could have had unexpected opportunity to have an actual in-person town hall during the last week in August when the House GOP got orders to march out of Washington early so as not to deal with the growing fracas over release of the full Epstein files.
But instead he and three other Republicans fled the country to visit Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. In early August he squeezed in a trip to Israel with a congressional delegation hosted by a pro-Israel American group to visit Jerusalem and Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee where he and his wife, Heather, renewed their baptismal vows in the Sea of Galilee.
“Incredibly moving,” Downing reported. He made no mention of prospects for peace in Gaza or concern for Palestine noncombatants.
Lots of questions to ask – so little time.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-34-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

Just two states in the nation have been unable to pass budgets for the 2025-26 fiscal year – and now, they’re staring down significant consequences if their respective legislative bodies fail to act soon.
Pennsylvania has entered its third month without a new budget, while Michigan is just weeks away from a potential shutdown. Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states have figured out their spending plans – or contingencies.
Listen to Emily’s audio recap:

Aside from their current budget woes, the Rust Belt states mirror each other in some unique ways. Both are helmed by Democratic governors with presidential ambitions and national profiles to match in Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer. They are considered battleground states with recently redrawn legislative districts generally regarded as fairer – and that resulted in split legislatures, two of three nationally. Transportation funding has emerged as the sticking point in the disparate budget negotiations, for very different reasons.
And the stakes in each of the impasses aren’t exactly the same.

 A Michigan shutdown would shutter services, inspections

If Michigan’s budget gridlock lasts long enough, the government would shut down in a dramatic fashion, loosely mirroring a federal shutdown that would shutter services and operations. State workers would be left without pay and potentially their benefits. State parks, statewide law enforcement services and seemingly mundane activities like food safety inspections could also be impacted, according to WDIV-TV Detroit.
Unlike the federal government, Michigan can’t pass resolutions supporting government functions without a budget. That’s led the state, on at least two recent occasions, to pass holdover “continuation budgets,” defined as a short term appropriation of the previous fiscal year’s spending, if the game gets too close to the final whistle.

Pennsylvania’s partisan gridlock drives impasse
In Pennsylvania, there is no possibility of a shutdown. The commonwealth’s Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that state workers must be paid during a budget impasse. But schools and counties don’t have that same guarantee – and taxpayers have to cover the interest on any loans to continue operations until state funding starts flowing again.
That’s on top of having state leaders consumed with the budget fight at the expense of other issues – such as the looming impact of recent reductions in federal programs and funding. And then there are the long-term costs if the resulting budget’s apparent “balance” relies on deferring expenses such as pension contributions or infrastructure investment. What’s more, discussion often happens behind closed doors with updates leaked or proposals rushed to public debate, which creates confusion.
Either way, both states will face consequences if their spending plans aren’t approved and signed into law soon.

 Transportation funding talks at a dead end

Future Michigan road maintenance and repair face dire consequences if a funding plan isn’t a part of the coming fiscal year budget. Many projects that were funded by bonds during Whitmer’s tenure are coming to a close, and there is no plan to reauthorize those bonds, necessitating a legislative solution.
The bonds were authorized by the state’s Transportation Commission in 2020 because the Republicans, who were previously in control of the Legislature in 2019, refused to raise taxes to pay for roads.
Budget talks this year have stalled partly due to road funding, but also because the House waited to pass its full government spending plan until late August; the Senate passed its full budget in May. Whitmer delivered her budget recommendations much earlier in the year.

Now that the Michigan House has a budget plan on the table, Republicans in the chamber say it is incumbent on the Senate to come forward with a roads funding plan to get negotiations going.
Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks and the Democrats in the Senate have offered no clear sign of when it would deliver a road funding plan, nor what it would look like. The GOP plan would put $3.4 billion toward roads.  Those dollars come from deep cuts elsewhere in their proposed budget, like major reductions to key departments that oversee statewide law enforcement, the attorney general’s office, environmental regulations and natural resources rules.
Whitmer has proposed $3 billion for roads and has been adamant that no deal can be reached without funding for roads, putting pressure on the Senate, which is controlled by her party.

This past Wednesday, several thousand construction workers, union members and business leaders were at the state Capitol building to urge lawmakers to find a sustainable solution to Michigan’s looming road funding cliff.
Schools in Michigan are also warning that they are now operating without real budgets that reflect the dollars they’ll actually be receiving from the state in the next fiscal year. Some school groups have said that layoff notices have already been issued because of the standoff.
The urban-rural divide present in both states hasn’t driven the wedge in Michigan’s transportation debate so much as it has in Pennsylvania.
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia had been warning for months about service cuts and fare increases while seeking additional funding to make up a $240 million budget deficit the agency has attributed to the loss of federal COVID-19 funding. Public entities nationwide used the funding – intended to serve as one-time, temporary emergency relief – to plug budget holes, creating what public finance experts have described as a looming fiscal crisis.

SEPTA’s planned fare increases and regional metro service reductions are on hold after they were blocked by a court ruling. Another judge then ordered the agency to restore service following a 20 percent reduction to bus and rail rides that had taken effect as the school year began in Philadelphia. In the interim, gambling site Fan Duel kicked in some money so Eagles fans had adequate subway service for the season opener.
Meanwhile, transit agencies in urban, suburban and rural areas outside the Philadelphia region say they might cut service, increase prices or both if the deadlock persists.
The debate has left the one million people (one in 13 Pennsylvanians) who use mass transit wondering what comes next.
Lawmakers have floated myriad options – from gambling revenue to legalizing recreational cannabis (already on the books in Michigan and included in Shapiro’s proposed budget) – not only to fund transit but address an overall structural deficit projected to grow to $6 billion during the upcoming year.
As in the past, oversimplified versions of the current transit funding dustup pitted mass transit agencies and the riders they serve in densely populated areas against drivers throughout the rest of the commonwealth.
Those drivers, the Republican argument goes, contribute to maintaining roads and bridges through tolls and license and registration fees. But most SEPTA riders also have a car or access to one through someone else in their household, according to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.
Senate Republicans have meanwhile struggled to reach consensus within their own caucus, which – with Democratic control of the House and governor’s office – has contributed to the deadlock, said Marc Stier, executive director of Penn Policy Center.
Gov. Josh Shapiro has publicly described his role almost as a mediator while calling for legislators – the GOP-controlled Senate, in particular – to work more and make tough decisions.

 Michigan has twice danced with shutdowns and could again

Under Hall, Michigan’s House GOP leadership has been on a mission to undo Democratic policies passed during their past two sessions in power. That includes trimming what it considers excessive and wasteful spending during the Whitmer years. They’ve taken a slow approach to finding cuts, contributing to the House delaying passage of its version of a budget until Aug. 26.
But Whitmer’s legacy depends partly on her campaign pledge to “fix the damn roads,” a centerpiece of her budget goals before she leaves office in 2026.
Despite different dynamics, those working long enough in the state’s capital of Lansing have opined on how closely the situation resembles the last two government shutdowns in 2007 and 2009 under then-Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm.The state government was divided then, too. Democrats controlled the House, while Republicans had the Senate.
The 2007 stalemate focused on a $2 billion revenue shortfall during the Great Recession, the seeds of which showed up in budgeting analyses as early as 2005.
“We were in a depression in Michigan, unlike anything the rest of the country was seeing,” former Republican House Majority Leader Mike Bishop recently told Michigan Advance.“If anybody wonders why there was so much venom and anxiety in Lansing during those times, that was the reason.”
Ultimately, the 2007 shutdown only lasted a few hours in the dark of night before a budget deal in the early morning.

In 2009, the budget battle again saw the era’s Democrats fighting for new revenue and the Republican zeal to balance the budget with cuts – similar to the actions being taken now by House Republicans in 2025.
With uncertainty about federal recovery dollars and lingering fatigue from 2007, the fight over revenue still loomed large in 2009, and the House, Senate and Granholm were again at odds. This time, Dillon agreed to some of the cuts Bishop proposed, putting him at odds with his own caucus and Granholm.
A budget deal wasn’t reached by the end of the fiscal year, a government shutdown began, but ended within hours after a continuation budget was passed.
 Pennsylvania’s costly standoff

In Pennsylvania, the government won’t cease to function over a budget impasse.
But the nine-month standoff a decade ago prompted some counties and school districts – which get about one-third of their revenue from the state – to borrow money that’s still being paid back in some cases, with taxpayers covering the interest.
“It’s a hidden tax,” said Bill Glasgall, public finance adviser at government-focused think tank the Volcker Alliance.
As the current impasse dragged on through the summer, counties and human service providers were bracing for impacts. State payments had stopped for schools as well as county-run programs like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care and public health. Bipartisan House Bill 1609 would ensure payments for those critical needs continue; it’s been parked in the appropriations committee for months.
Some programs serving the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians have cut pay and delayed spending on less urgent needs like conferences and tech upgrades.
About one third of the state’s 67 counties already have dipped into savings to cover costs and a few are researching borrowing just in case the stalemate drags on, according to Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.
“If this is going to be a continuous feature of Pennsylvania politics, …  it’s just not fair,” Kopko said. “It’s not efficient. It’s not good at all. This isn’t how it’s supposed to work.”
Senate Republicans advanced what they described as a stop-gap budget to mitigate the fallout alongside a transit funding proposal. But both measures quickly died in the Democrat-controlled House.  Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said his Republican colleagues lack urgency.
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”
Stier, who once ran for a state House seat as a Democrat, predicts a resolution by mid-to-late September achieved by shifting money around so that the budget appears to be balanced – but isn’t really.
“You can keep the budget artificially under $50 billion. But you’re in fact, going to be spending more later,” he said.
Public finance experts advise against such one-time maneuvers.
“People talk about kicking the can down the road. Really, it’s rolling a snowball,” said Noah Winn-Ritzenberg, Volcker’s senior director of public finance. “When you get there, the problem is just going to be larger.”
And it looks bad to lenders, potentially increasing borrowing costs, Glasgall noted.
“Higher interest rates on debt – that’s effectively a tax on the citizens,” he said.
While Pennsylvania has improved its approach to budgeting and finance in recent years, Glasgall – like Stier – said the ongoing stalemate could prompt leaders to delay pension payments, artificially suppress estimated Medicaid costs (another sticking point in negotiations), delay infrastructure investment or resort to another such “gimmick” or a combination thereof.
“If there were structural changes that could make people be honest about things like this,” Stier said, “I would be all in favor of it.”

 Is there a better way to budget? 

Past years have seen more dramatic budget impasses than what’s transpired so far in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Glasgall noted. Illinois once operated for years without a budget. A New Jersey shutdown once infamously afforded then-Gov. Chris Christie an extremely private beach trip. Massachusetts hit its deadline this year after a 14-year late streak (to Pennsylvania’s 13 missed deadlines of the past 20).
A couple of other states haven’t exactly finalized theirs for 2025-26. North Carolina adopted a mini-budget to keep the government running as deliberations continue. Oregon’s spending plan has come together in pieces to prevent a sticking point or two from delaying the entire thing.
Both strategies often emerge in conversations about structural change that happen when budgets are late.
Another is the automatic continuation resolution (a state defaults to operating according to its outgoing budget until electeds can agree on the next). Twenty states have this option, which has its critics. Public finance experts seem to agree that reducing pressure on budget negotiations doesn’t help them resolve faster.
Stier pointed to the 2009 Pennsylvania court decision requiring state workers to be paid during an impasse as a structural change that has “made things worse.”
“It’s harder to get a budget done because there’s less pressure,” Stier said.
A piecemeal budgeting approach like Oregon’s system affords flexibility, Glasgall noted.
Stier said he doesn’t think that would work in Pennsylvania because it would advantage the GOP, because it delays tax and/or spending increases and so Democrats wouldn’t agree to the change.
Structural changes also won’t negate political divisions nor the temptation to succumb to quick fixes when negotiations lock up.
“As a political scientist, … we like to find that structure makes a huge difference. And sadly, the research over the last 30 or 40 years has not shown that’s the case,” Stier said.
Partisanship also is contributing to both states’ budget delays, as is party infighting. Glasgall said others have endured budget stalemates when under single-party control, including in California, Kansas and New Jersey.

In Michigan, enduring the crisis of two shutdowns in close succession created political momentum for change.
The Citizens Research Council of Michigan made the case for an earlier budget timeline during the 2009 budget standoff, noting that the process itself might be to blame.
And John Nixon, the former budget director in Utah, was hired in late 2010 as director of the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget to help Michigan after the incoming Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, was elected that year.
Nixon was tasked with not just fixing the budget process, but with helping Snyder improve Michigan’s subpar financial standing in several areas.
“It was trying to incorporate best practices and spending within our means,” Nixon said. “We’re feeding a bunch of local governments. We’re feeding school districts. How can they count on it?”
The solution from Snyder was to hold the Legislature to a loose June 30 deadline for talks to end and having a budget passed on July 1.
Despite some pushback, the move was embraced, Nixon said. The 2011 Legislature also saw Republicans back in control of the trifecta governor’s office, the House and the Senate. In 2019, the Legislature codified the deadline into statute, but with no real penalties for missing the mark.
Michigan’s Legislature has since missed that July 1 deadline on multiple occasions, but only by a few days or weeks, and the state never went down to the wire with its budget talks quite like it did in 2007 and 2009
Hall attempted to pass a resolution last month that would mean no pay for legislators if they blow the July 1 deadline. The measure ultimately failed.
“Would that swing people?” Nixon said. “The thing you don’t want to do is you don’t want to pass a junk budget.”
Nixon noted that in Utah, a budget impasse led the state’s leaders to enact measures that obligated them to pass base budgets during the first week of session. That way, the government wouldn’t shut down in the event of a stalemate.
He also said a solution would be needed to the current impasse and budget struggles in the years to come if Michigan gets a “double whammy” of a state shutdown and a potential federal shutdown – which appears more likely in the era of uncertainty during the  second Trump administration.
Winn-Ritzenberg says institutional values tend to be most influential, ultimately.
“A lot of it really comes down more to culture within a state of either relying on budget maneuvers or a culture where [lawmakers] pass a clean budget and take pride in a professional approach in the budget office,” Winn-Ritzenberg said.
In Michigan’s case, the question is whether that culture will persist, while in Pennsylvania, it’s whether it ever emerges.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PA-and-MI-budget.png,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

For nearly a decade, Catholic Charities of East Tennessee has relied on federal funding to provide legal aid to victims of elder abuse, domestic violence and child sexual and physical abuse. 
But, earlier this summer, the Knoxville nonprofit was put on notice by the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs: it could no longer receive public crime victim funding if the crime victims being served were also immigrants.
When agency staff inquired about a new federal grant notice that could sustain their ongoing work with children victimized by physical abuse, sexual abuse, human trafficking and other crimes, they got a similar answer.
“The response we got was that the goal is to serve American children only. American citizen children,” Alessandra Ceccarelli-Masters, the agency’s immigration services manager, said.
It was a blow for the agency, which aids crime victims regardless of immigration status in three dozen east Tennessee counties.
“Why are we differentiating between kids who have gone through the same, horrific experiences?” she said. 
Tennessee ends funding for legal clinic serving immigrant crime victims  

“I thought that in a country like the United States we were able, willing and it was one of our values to be able to help survivors of crime, especially children, regardless of their legal status, so it’s very sad to see that they’re imposing these types of restrictions.”
Catholic Charities is among scores of Tennessee nonprofit agencies now contending with a flurry of directives from state and federal officials about who they can and cannot serve as the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration reshapes crime victim funding. 
The federal government, through the Department of Justice, is the single largest source of funding for many Tennessee domestic violence shelters, abuse hotlines, sexual assault centers and child counseling services — organizations that generally don’t ask a victim’s immigration status.
Some Tennessee nonprofits rely on federal funding for half or more of their annual operating budgets. Collectively these organizations have served more than 95,000 victims in Tennessee annually.
Nonprofit directors described the volume and, in some instances, vagueness of emails and memos outlining restrictions on serving immigrants — and threatening punitive action against organizations for noncompliance — as destabilizing.
Dismantling programs that have enabled victims to come forward will only hamper the ability to hold perpetrators accountable, contrary to the Trump administration’s stated tough-on-crime goals, they said.
‘Barriers being created at every turn’
In July, the Department of Justice’s Office of Victims of Crime announced that states and nonprofits receiving federal victim grants must agree to support and assist in federal immigration enforcement — including granting entry to their facilities.  A coalition of 20 Democratic-led states has filed suit challenging the restrictions.
New grant descriptions subsequently posted online by the Department of Justice require victim-serving nonprofits to describe in writing how they will use federal funds in “supporting law enforcement operations (including immigration law enforcement operations),” “supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault,” and “protecting American children.”
On August 22, a memo issued by the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs warned against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for nonprofits receiving the federal grants, raising uncertainty about whether agencies that conduct targeted outreach to Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ and other communities to encourage victims to seek help could run afoul of new rules. 
Then, late last month the Department of Justice issued a memo to states and nonprofits barring the use of federal dollars to provide legal services to crime who are living in the country illegally, the Reuters news service reported.
Even before the federal directive, the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs informed nonprofits they could no longer provide legal services to immigrant crime victims with federal grants. The Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, on June 30, shut down a long-running legal clinic that had helped immigrant survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking access visas specifically set aside for victims who cooperated with law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice.
“There are barriers being created at every turn,” Cecelia Friedman Levin, advocacy coordinator for the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, a national network of agencies that serve immigrant survivors of violence.
Friedman Levin said that directives jeopardize decades of work by advocates to earn the trust of immigrant crime victims.
“We’re seeing all these safeguards being overshadowed by an enforcement over everything mentality, which means victims don’t feel safe coming out their door to seek help, and their safety is compromised, which makes communities less safe,” she said. “This undermines decades of efforts to make sure survivors know there’s a place for them to go.”
The Department of Justice did not respond last week to Lookout questions about the funding changes.
Survey: Immigrants increasingly hesitant to report crimes
High visibility immigration sweeps across the nation and a  proliferation of cooperation agreements between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement are further deterring victims who lack legal immigration status from coming forward, she said.
In Tennessee more than two dozen local sheriff and police departments have entered into so-called 287(g) agreements with federal officials to serve immigration warrants, jail immigrants or operate enhanced task forces that give local law enforcement immigration enforcement powers since the beginning of the second Trump administration. The Tennessee Department of Safety & Homeland Security has also entered into an agreement.
Separately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement also reversed its longstanding policy of requiring agents to ascertain whether an individual is a crime victim before taking enforcement action. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

As a result, victims of crime who lack legal immigration status are increasingly hesitant to report crimes, according to a survey conducted in the Spring by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors. 
Of 170 advocates and attorneys who responded to the survey, half reported immigrant crime victims opted not to contact police, or show up to court out of fear of being swept up.
Officer Mario Diaz, Metro Nashville Police Department’s Hispanic community liaison, said patrol officers have seen the hesitance to call police play out after widely publicized immigration sweeps in the city. 
In May, mass traffic stops conducted by the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Nashville’s heavily immigrant south side resulted in the detention of about 200 people. 
In the weeks that followed, Diaz said, “patrol officers were telling me ‘hey, we’re not getting any calls for service in particular neighborhoods.”
The calls for services have since returned to normal levels, but Diaz said “people are obviously more concerned and more worried.”
The Nashville police department has not entered into any agreement with the federal government to enforce immigration laws, a message Diaz said he has found himself repeating more this year.
“People will say to me I saw Metro police make a traffic stop,” he said. “Are you guys collaborating with ICE? Those questions I’ve never been asked before. People are more worried and more alert.”
Tennessee nonprofit organization leaders also expressed worries that speaking out against new immigration restrictions on federal funding could further hobble their ability to carry out their mission of aiding victims. A half dozen nonprofit directors contacted by the Lookout declined to speak publicly about the impact of new federal funding restrictions on the adult and child victims they serve.
Ceccarelli-Masters, Catholic Charities’ immigration services manager, said her agency was also initially reluctant to speak up about the new limits imposted on their ability to serve victims. Catholic Charities will continue to provide the same services to victims regardless of immigration status, but rely on sliding scale fees and non-public funding to do so, she said. 
“In February, March, we were a bit reluctant to talk to journalists because we did not want to draw too much attention to the work we do,” she said. “But I think it’s important to let people know what’s happening now. The consequences of the policies that this administration is administering is that we’re not able to provide services to survivors who are not citizens. It’s shortsighted. We’re setting ourselves up for circles of violence to continue.”

“I’m the only candidate with two different agencies giving me a 100% conservative voting record,” said Barrett, a state representative from Dickson. “The difference between being 100% and somewhere less is where the fight is.”
On Oct. 7, primary voters will vote in a special election for the Tennessee 7th U.S. Congressional District triggered by the resignation of Mark Green earlier this year.
Nearly a dozen candidates entered the Republican primary, but the conservative think tank American for Prosperity Tennessee invited only four candidates to its Sept. 5 debate in West Nashville based on polling and fundraising numbers.
Barrett, Brentwood state Rep. Gino Bulso, Franklin state Rep. Lee Reeves, and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Vanns are also the four candidates in the race with state-level legislative or government experience.
A pre-debate Americans for Prosperity poll of 500 voters showed the four men each getting between 15-20% support. The poll’s margin of error effectively means they are tied.

For two hours, moderators attempted to create some separation between the candidates, but the debate rules banned cross-talk between candidates, and they weren’t allowed to mention each other’s names.
The moderators also tried to distinguish any policy differences between the four men and President Donald Trump. Only Barrett criticized any of Trump’s actions, calling out his support for Operation Warp Speed to create the coronavirus vaccine.
Americans for Prosperity was one of the few conservative groups that didn’t endorse Trump in his 2024 presidential primary, backing former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley instead.
All the candidates agreed they would have voted for the Big Beautiful Bill, wouldn’t push legalization for marijuana and that the federal government needs to be smaller. The differences that emerged were more stylistic than substantial.
Bulso’s answers tended to linger as he attempted to show his legal knowledge. The state representative in his second term is a lawyer who often tries to argue political debates like they are written arguments before a court. Bulso cited clauses in the constitution at least five times during the debate.
Reeves made it clear from the start that he wanted to be known as the “America First” candidate in the race, trying to tie himself to Trump. The first-term state representative hit all the key conservative points, calling for the elimination of the Department of Education, more immigration crackdowns, and the defunding of “sanctuary cities.”

Van Epps has mentioned his military service and experience running a state department multiple times. He made it clear his priority in office will be working with Trump and on defense issues.
The congressional district borders the U.S. Army’s Fort Campbell base, which straddles the Tennessee-Kentucky border. Many of the district’s voters are current or former military, which helped Green as a former infantry officer when he first ran for the seat.
The district encompasses the western half of Middle Tennessee before taking a claw-like shape out of Nashville and Williamson County. Since it was partisanly redrawn in 2022, Green consistently won about 60% of the district’s vote.
Democrats are also holding a competitive primary between Nashville state reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell, and Nashville businessman Darden Copeland. Despite it being a special election, political rating agencies still score the seat as solidly Republican.
The general election is on December 2.

The state received about $1.6 million this year from a federal grant meant to prevent teen pregnancies and teach teenagers about sexually transmitted infections, as well as other life skills, according to the federal Department of Health and Human Services. That money went to five nonprofits across the state, according to the Department of Public Health, which is in charge of distributing the grant.
Last month, the Trump administration sent a letter to 40 states, including South Carolina, telling them to remove references to gender found in the sexual education materials the groups were using, saying the law included nothing authorizing states to teach about gender. The federal Administration for Children and Families had previously approved the curriculum for organizations to use, which the letter said was an error.
South Carolina’s organizations reported using three teachers’ manuals to which the administration objected. One suggested instructors ask students to share their pronouns as “a way of creating a safe space for transgender or gender nonconforming youth.” All three explained differences between a person’s gender identity, gender expression and sex assigned at birth, according to the letter.

Gov. Henry McMaster praised the move as a way of removing “goofy stuff” from the materials “that have no business being in there.”
“I think the Trump administration has done a big favor going through these materials and finding these things and calling it to everyone’s attention,” McMaster told reporters last week.
The information about gender flagged in the letter make up little to none of the actual content of the lessons, said leaders for three of the five groups receiving the funding. The curriculum is meant to teach teenagers about how to practice safe sex, as well as how to have healthy relationships, overcome obstacles in life and be responsible with money, the organizations’ leaders said.
The letter gave organizations until Oct. 27 to stop using those materials or risk losing funding. The Department of Public Health is working with those nonprofits to make sure they meet that deadline, a spokesperson said in an email.
Representatives for Columbia Housing Authority and Auxilium Community Development Corporation, two of the groups that receive grant funding, did not respond to requests for comment. Both advertise programs teaching youth life skills on their websites.
Lowcountry Youth Services
Lowcountry Youth Services, which runs several programs in Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties, wasn’t using the instructions on gender and sexuality at all, said executive director ReZsaun Lewis.
At a school district’s request, the nonprofit will come into the school for 10 weeks and teach groups of about 15 to 20 students life skills, such as how to respond to difficult situations in life, how to communicate effectively and how to advocate for themselves, Lewis said.
“There was nothing related to gender ideology or anything like that,” Lewis said. “It was all about making sure that the kids had a better framework for life.”
Children, their parents and the school officials who sat in on the courses all enjoyed the program, which the nonprofit chose because it offered good exercises to teach students about leadership and communication, Lewis said.
For example, programs for elementary schools taught children how to share and make others feel included during playtime, Lewis said. For older children, the lessons grew more complex, such as helping young men overcome the stigma around showing emotions and teaching them to communicate their feelings, he said.
The nonprofit, which has run programs in more than a dozen schools across three Lowcountry school districts, is evaluating its options moving forward, Lewis said. Whatever curriculum leaders decide to use, Lewis’ top priority is keeping the program going to make sure students who might lack mentorship at home have access to trustworthy adults, he said.
“We’re going to do the work, and if the work requires us getting a different curriculum, we’ll get a different curriculum,” Lewis said.

Whatever curriculum the nonprofit decides to use, Lewis said he worries about federal or state officials finding another “boogeyman,” or another topic mentioned in the materials, that will force the group to change its programming again.
“We don’t know how we’re able to do the work in a way that makes them happy, to be honest with you,” Lewis said. “We’re doing the best we can, and we’ll continue to do the best we can, because the kids need us.”
“If we’re not doing the work and organizations like ours are taken out of the fight, then our kids really are left at an extreme disadvantage,” he continued.
Palmetto Place Children and Youth Services
In Columbia, Palmetto Place Children and Youth Services is also focused on how to keep its afterschool programs on sexual health running, said executive director Damien Talley.
No matter what directives come up, Palmetto Place will continue helping teenagers in whatever capacity possible, even if that means directing them to other resources, Talley said.
“As long as there’s a need for us and the services we provide, we will find a way to navigate any challenges with funding to support our youth,” Talley said.
The nonprofit chose its curriculum because leaders felt it was particularly instructive about both abstinence and contraception. The hundreds of teenagers who have gone through the program have found it helpful to avoid pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, as well as know what to do if they end up in one of those situations, Talley said.
“We wanted to give them as much information as they could have so they could make the best possible choices,” he said.
The group is continuing to use parts of the curriculum but have removed any reference to gender, Talley said. Based on the instructions the nonprofit received from the state, that should put the program in compliance with the letter, he said.
Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee
Along with lessons about sexual health, the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee use $60,000 in federal grant funding each year to teach preteens and teens about how to be good leaders and manage their finances, said program director Michael Woods.
About 120 youth participated in the program this year, Woods said. The programs take place outside of school, and anyone participating needs their parents’ permission to discuss sexual health, Woods said.
The Florence-based nonprofit has stopped the courses using the curriculum flagged in the letter, Woods said. To do otherwise and risk losing grant funding would mean halting the programs altogether, taking away a vital resource for many children in the community, he said.
The Boys & Girls Club is still figuring out how to move forward, he said.
“It’s our responsibility to make sure they’re responsible and caring citizens, at the end of the day,” Woods said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sex-education-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

(Courtesy of Howard K. Marcus)OMAHA — The new Omaha mayor weighed in Monday on the 2nd Congressional District’s Democratic primary.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing endorsed Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades in a busy field as the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House seat in the state’s most politically divided and diverse district.

Ewing said Congress requires “leaders who are ready to get to work from day one” and said, “Crystal Rhoades is that leader.”
“Her leadership as a key advisor on my mayoral campaign was not just instrumental to our victory,” Ewing said. “It was a clear demonstration of her ability to navigate complex challenges and deliver results.”
Rhoades said having Ewing’s endorsement was a great honor. She called him “an experienced leader” and said she was “grateful for his support.” 
Democrats started lining up to run next year even before news broke of U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., not running in 2026, partly because the Omaha-based district is a place where the party’s nominees have lost four straight times by single digits. 
The crowded Democratic field includes State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County newcomer Denise Powell and Navy veteran Kishla Askins. 
Randall Adkins, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor, described Ewing as Omaha’s most prominent Democrat. 
“His endorsement is a signal to his supporters that they should consider supporting her financially or otherwise,” Adkins said.

Some Democrats point to the mayoral election in May as a hint of a possible blue tide for the state’s second-largest party to capitalize on, though political observers acknowledge that the fundamentals of the slightly right-leaning 2nd District haven’t changed. 
National and state GOP strategists have acknowledged that an open-seat 2nd District race is winnable for Democrats, but they say Republicans can win and hold the seat. The GOP primary to replace Bacon includes Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha. 
Rhoades, a lifetime Omahan, was previously elected as a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all regulator. 
She has a history of helping local Democrats win elections as a political consultant, including helping Ewing become the first Democrat in more than a decade to lead the largest city in Nebraska. She also has faced criticisms for butting heads with people who disagree with her.
“Whether it’s advocating for working families, protecting access to healthcare, or standing up for civil rights,” Ewing said, “Crystal has never backed down. She will go to Washington with a clear mandate to get Congress working for the people again.”

In October 2023, a group calling itself Return to the Land established its first “Whites only community” in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. They followed that with a second enclave nearby in 2025.
The group, which describes itself as a “private membership association” that helps groups form “European heritage communities,” plans to build four more sites, including another location in the Ozarks and two in Appalachia.
Return to the Land believes that by calling themselves a private membership association they can create a white ethnostate – a type of state in which residence is limited to white people – and legally exclude people based on race, religion and sexual orientation.
If you read the words of Eric Orwoll, the group’s co-founder, its mission is clear: “You want a white nation? Build a white town … it can be done. We’re doing it.”
As a scholar of right-wing extremism, I have examined several groups calling for a white homeland in America. The creation of a white ethnostate is often seen as an ultimate goal of such white nationalism, which argues that white people form part of a genetically and culturally superior race deserving of protection and preservation. While Return to the Land doesn’t identify as white nationalists, their statements often align with the ideology.
White ethnostates, big and small
One of the best-known plans for a white ethnostate is the Northwest Imperative, popularized by white nationalists during the 1970s and ’80s. The plan involved certain citizens taking 10% of the United States – the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana – and excluding all nonwhite people from living there.
Proponents of the plan argued that these states were already majority white and contained large tracts of undeveloped land, making the territory ideal for white-only settlement. High-profile extremists of the time such as Richard Butler, Robert Mathews and David Lane supported the plan.
Still today, groups such as the Northwest Front, a white nationalist group founded in 2009 and located in the Pacific Northwest, continue to promote variations of this idea.
While the Pacific Northwest has a long history with right-wing extremist organizing, the proponents of whites-only communities have also targeted areas of the Northeast as possible locations for a white ethnostate.
In 2018, for example, Tom Kawczynski, town manager of Jackman, Maine, was fired when his views came to light, including views that have been characterized as “pro-white.”
More recently, in 2023, the People’s Initiative of New England, a splinter group of the neo-Nazi organization National Socialist Club-131, introduced themselves on the online platform Substack. There, the group laid out its goal of establishing the six states of New England — Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont — as white-only.
The goal of gaining control of multiple states is unrealistic, of course, at least peacefully. Therefore, a popular alternative, along the lines of Return to the Land’s actions, is to establish smaller all-white communities.
In 2013, media outlets reported that neo-Nazi Craig Cobb was buying land in the small town of Leith, North Dakota, to build a white nationalist community. The town rallied to oppose this attempt.
Later that year, Cobb was charged with seven felonies related to confronting residents with a gun. He was sentenced to probation for four years and deeded the property back to the town in 2014.
And in 2021, leaked Telegram chats revealed that Christopher Pohlhaus, a former U.S. Marine and founder of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, wanted to establish a whites-only community in Springfield, Maine. Pohlhaus was developing a military training facility as part of these efforts when media coverage led him to sell the property and move out of state.
The danger of a white ethnostate
These various attempts to develop a white ethnostate are not simply individual, isolated cases. They form part of a larger movement toward achieving white nationalism.
A major part of white nationalism today is focused on anti-immigrant hatred. That has spurred major acts of extreme violence such as the 2019 murders of 23 people in El Paso, Texas, the majority of whom were Hispanic.

The “great replacement theory,” a conspiracy theory popular among white nationalists, argues that various policies are leading to the destruction of the white race. This theory inspired the 2022 mass killing of 10 Black Americans in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.
The shooter selected the supermarket because of its location in a predominantly Black neighborhood and left behind a white supremacy manifesto.
Communities across the U.S. have successfully resisted the establishment of white ethnostates.
The residents of Leith, North Dakota, did this by creating a website informing people about what was happening in their community. Public outcry also met Pohlhaus in Maine.
As for Return to the Land, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in July 2025 that his office is reviewing the group’s actions and whether they violate the law.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline) Criminal justice reform advocates are pressing Colorado corrections officials for more details on their efforts to reduce the state’s prison population after the requirements of a 2018 law were triggered for the first time.
The vacancy rate in state prisons stood at 1.92% as of Aug. 16, marking the 30th consecutive day the department maintained a vacancy rate below 3%,  according to a Colorado Department of Corrections letter reviewed by Newsline. House Bill 18-1410, a bipartisan law passed unanimously by the General Assembly in 2018, requires that once that threshold is reached, the department must begin to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population in coordination with the state parole board and the Office of Community Corrections, which oversees halfway houses.
The Office of Community Corrections is required to identify open beds that CDOC can use on a weekly basis until the vacancy rate rises above 4% for 30 consecutive days, according to CDOC spokesperson Alonda Gonzalez. The department must also provide a list of people who are incarcerated who meet a specific set of criteria that would make them eligible for parole to the state parole board.

“Beyond these statutory requirements, CDOC actively monitors facilities, adjusts bed assignments and staffing, facilitates transfers, and ensures safe and orderly operations statewide,” Gonzalez said in a statement. 
The parole board isn’t required to release all of those people under the population management law — only to hold a hearing to review each of their cases.
Colorado’s prison population has been steadily on the rise since it drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, rising from a low of 15,434 in June 2021 to 17,945 at the end of July, according to CDOC data. 
It’s been just over three weeks since CDOC reached the threshold requiring measures to reduce the prison population, but the department was unable to provide Newsline with updated information before publication. The Office of Community Corrections, which is part of the state Division of Criminal Justice within the Department of Public Safety, did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheriffs seek ‘urgent action’
Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, said the law outlines three groups of people CDOC must make lists of to send to the parole board to review eligibility, and she obtained two of those lists through an open records request. 
The list of those who are close to their mandatory release date included 13 people, and the list of people who are considered low risk due to non-violent convictions included 92 people. She did not receive information on “conditional releases,” which refers to someone who needs to complete a task, such as a victim notification or a drug and alcohol class, before they can be released. 
“We never really intended for this bill to be big releases,” Donner said of the 2018 law. “It was just, can we be efficient? Can we fully utilize community corrections?”
Donner also hasn’t been able to get confirmation of exactly how many community corrections beds are available from the state, but providers have told her there are “hundreds” available that could be better used by the department. Using those beds, to Donner, is the “biggest opportunity” to efficiently reduce the prison population.
The Colorado Legislature considered a bill this year that considered additional options for housing people who make parole and to slow prison population growth, but it failed after the state House never took it up for a floor vote. 
People sentenced to state prison have been held in county jails longer than normal as a result of CDOC’s low bed capacity, which Donner said has been an intentional way the department has artificially inflated its vacancy rates to avoid hitting the 3% threshold. 
In July, 17 Colorado sheriffs wrote a letter to Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, seeking “urgent action” to address the backlog of people in county jail custody awaiting transfer to CDOC. The state reimburses sheriffs offices $77.16 per person per day awaiting transfer to prison, which the letter says leads to sheriffs absorbing a funding shortfall of more than $60 per day.  
“County jails were never designed — or funded — to house state inmates for extended periods,” the letter said. “Yet we’re being forced to expand capacity and stretch already limited staff to accommodate inmates who should be in state custody. This isn’t just unsustainable — it’s unfair to local taxpayers.”
Donner emphasized that the 2018 law was bipartisan and passed the Colorado Legislature unanimously, “so this is not a controversial concept in terms of managing the population through efficiency — nobody is getting out ‘early.’” She said if jail backlogs were addressed sooner, some of the measures in the law could have been implemented sooner and more beds could have been opened.

(Photo courtesy of Xcel Energy)A North Dakota interim legislative committee has selected Nucleon Energy, a Canadian development company, to chart the state’s path to a nuclear-powered future. 
The Alberta-based nuclear development company will spend the next 12 months studying the possibility of attracting the resurgent nuclear power industry to the state. The key elements of the study will include identifying potential locations, gauging public support and laying the groundwork for the federal licensing process. 
“We’re believers that nuclear will be an affordable source of power that does not need subsidies that can be competitive with other fuel types,” said Will Bridge, chief technology officer for Nucleon Energy. “That hasn’t proven itself out yet. But we also believe we need to start now.”
Nuclear energy research gets green light in North Dakota

The selection was made by the Advanced Nuclear Energy Committee, an interim committee composed of legislators, executive agency representatives and private sector leaders. The group reviewed proposals from nine firms during a Wednesday hearing, including two with North Dakota ties, but ultimately chose Nucleon Energy. 
Lawmakers earlier this year approved House Bill 1025, which authorized up to $300,000 in state funding for a nuclear energy study. Nucleon’s proposal included a cost estimate of $275,000. 
Nucleon specializes in small modular reactors – smaller and less expensive alternatives to the behemoth facilities providing conventional nuclear power. The company’s presentation emphasized the importance of public engagement. 
“I thought Nucleon had the best background material and plan,” said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, a member of the committee.

The company’s first step will be finding the right site. Executives emphasized the importance of existing or planned transmission infrastructure in the site selection process. 
“It’s fundamental that we put these where the transmission grid either now or in the near future allows, otherwise we drive up costs for ratepayers and that’s not going to make sense for North Dakotans,” said Ryan Tourigny, Nucleon’s chief development officer. 
But the crucial factor in determining whether a site could realistically host a nuclear power plant will be whether there is public support in the local community – or not. 
“The permitting cycle for nuclear plants is so long and so expensive that you can’t push that into a community,” Bridge said. Nucleon has had success with bringing neutral experts into a community to educate people on the technology and ensuring that community feels like a partner on the project from day one. “We see that as just good business. You can’t push nuclear facilities into communities that don’t want them.”
The importance of early public engagement was echoed by many committee members. 
“As elected officials, we run into the fact that you say the word ‘nuclear’ and you get a radioactive reaction from communities,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, a member of Legislative Management. 
Nuclear seen as a power solution but needs more study, legislators say

Pam Gorman Prochaska, general manager of Xcel Energy’s nuclear fleet and one of the private sector representatives on the committee, said she has seen that play out. County officials in Minnesota approached Xcel about bringing nuclear power to their community at one point, Gorman Prochaska said, but “within weeks, the anti-nuclear community had infiltrated that community and went literally door-to-door” using a lot of “scare tactics.” 
One of the biggest drivers of anti-nuclear sentiment has been the question of where the radioactive waste, a byproduct of nuclear power generation, will be stored. The United States, unlike some other countries, has no centralized permanent storage facility. 
“It seems like, nationally, we’ve got a crisis that we don’t have permanent storage facilities,” said Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo. 
Michelle Zietlow-Miller, testifying for the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, said the lack of a central depository for nuclear waste is not a significant issue. All of the nuclear waste produced in the United States during the last 40 years can fit on a single football field, she said, 15 yards high. The waste is solid, not liquid, and is typically stored in secure casks on-site at nuclear power facilities, she said.

Yet many questions about next generation nuclear reactors remain. Tourigny said they believe the technology will become economical over time and right now North Dakota should focus on laying the groundwork for future projects without necessarily needing to have customers for the electricity lined up. 
Bridge, the chief technology officer, acknowledged there are still questions about whether the new generation of reactor technology will be economically viable. There are small modular reactors being developed around the world, Bridge said, but none have so far been proven as both affordable and commercially viable.
Other obstacles in the nuclear industry include lengthy regulatory timelines at the federal level, the potentially prohibitive cost of nuclear power plants compared to alternative fuel sources and reconstructing the domestic supply chain that has been mostly dormant for decades. 
Nucleon Energy was not a unanimous choice. Five members of the committee expressed a preference for the runner-up: Excel Services Corporation, which has specialized in nuclear energy development for over 40 years. Excel was named first alternate. Nucleon’s contract for the study will be negotiated by Legislative Council and is subject to approval by Legislative Management’s chair, Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot. 
Interest in nuclear power is growing as public utilities look for ways to meet the rising demand for electricity driven, in part, by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and data centers. Katie Austgen, with the Nuclear Energy Institute, told the committee there have been 530 nuclear reactors proposed across North America that could begin operating in the 2030s. Of those, two reactors were recently completed and began operating in Georgia, nine are under construction, and 23 are officially planned. 
“The whole country is taking this challenge on,” said Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown. “It’s time to get in the race and get going with this because it’s quite a long process.”

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)As a former county reporter in northwest Wisconsin, I always tried to find a local angle to a national or regional story.
I’ve been  thinking the two former papers I used to work for – Spooner Advocate and Sawyer County Record – were probably looking for readers who have friends or relatives with some connection to the recent mass shooting Wednesday, Aug. 27, at the Annunciation Catholic Church in South Minneapolis that left two youngsters dead and 21 others injured.
I  Googled the church’s location and realized that I had been just six blocks from it early this spring when I visited the Russian Art Museum. The church is also 10 or 15 minutes north of where my sister, Charlotte, lives.
Later, Charlotte called me and said she and my other sister, Alma, had attended the church for Christmas Eve or New Year’s Eve mass. Charlotte mentioned that a neighbor had a daughter who attended the same pre-K-8 Catholic school as the students who were  fired upon.
Without knowing any victims, just the proximity of the church to my previous visit and my sisters’ and the neighbors’ experience, there is some connection I have with that tragedy, be it ever so thin.
A couple of years ago, when I worked for the Sawyer County Record, I did a story on a woman who works in Hayward whose son had been attending Michigan State University when a man went on a short shooting rampage in February 2023 on campus.
It was after doing that story of the local boy to the Michigan State University shooting, that it hit me that more and more of us are having some connection to a gun shooting, especially school shootings.
We may not have witnessed the shooting, and we hopefully didn’t have any loved one injured or traumatized, but still we might be one or two or three or four persons removed from the tragedy, like the  woman whose son was in proximity to the Michigan State shooter.
It’s just logical with more and more of these mass shootings more of us would have these connections.
There are those directly impacted by mass shootings, the victims and their families, but there are scores more that are indirectly connected, and because of those connections the tragedy has more importance. The event becomes less abstract as you hear about a friend’s daughter or niece or cousin who had to hide under her desk to avoid rounds of gunfire echoing through the halls of education. It becomes less abstract as the mother of the Michigan State University student describes her fear when she heard about the gunman and knew her son might be shot.
After a mass shooting happens, we hear people argue  that it’s not the guns causing the deaths but the shooters, and then others advocate for legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of people likely to commit such atrocities.
After a mass shooting, we’ve become too familiar with how this debate over guns unfolds, and many of us are frustrated that very little ever changes.
However, I believe we will have sensible gun legislation so those with mental illnesses don’t have access to a gun, and red flag laws will help law enforcement identify those who are more likely to go on a shooting spree and secure weapons before a tragedy occurs.
I think it is inevitable because attitudes are going to change as more and more of us have these direct and indirect connections to mass shootings.
And a connection to a tragedy changes attitudes.
When drug overdose deaths were a thing that appeared to mostly happen in far-away cities, there wasn’t that much support in rural Wisconsin for attacking the problem. But when overdose deaths began to occur in the suburbs and rural communities, the reality of the drug epidemic hit home, and widespread support for addressing it grew. 
We are slowly, incrementally, each finding some point of connection to a mass shooting just because there have been so many of them: 503 mass shootings in 2024 alone.
The question in my mind is not if the legislation will happen, but how many people will have to die before enough of us, regardless of political affiliation, demand  sensible gun legislation.

(Photo courtesy of Sarina Larson)I fell in love with flying when I was 15 years old right here in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho. My dad’s friend, Jerry — who I later learned was a legendary local flight instructor — nonchalantly offered me an airplane ride one summer morning. I had no idea it would change the course of my life.
Jerry said something that day that I’ll never forget: “You know, girls make good pilots. They’re often less impulsive and more thoughtful than men.”
As I processed his words over the hum of the engine and the view of the mountains below, a light switched on in my head. Until then, I thought flying was something men did. Jerry helped me see that I could belong in aviation too.
But my path from that airplane ride to pursuing an aviation career was anything but simple. Flight training costs are high. Mentorship is limited, especially in rural or smaller communities. Often, the young people who succeed are those with family ties in aviation or the financial ability to fund years of training. I had neither.
Today, the aviation industry needs new talent more than ever. Boeing projects that by 2042, the United States will need 127,000 new pilots and 135,000 new Airframe & Powerplant mechanics to maintain and expand the nation’s fleets. Meanwhile, the FAA is short 3,000 air traffic controllers, with training pipelines that take years to complete. The future of aviation depends on welcoming diverse, motivated professionals, including young women who struggle to see themselves in the cockpit, control tower or hangar.
I founded the Gem State Chapter of Women in Aviation International to change this, and it’s what motivates our Girls in Aviation Day held each year in Boise.
This year’s free, community event is slated for Saturday, Sept. 20 at Jackson Jet Center at the Boise Airport, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Girls ages 8 to 18 will get the chance to explore inside real airplanes, connect with real pilots, and experience real opportunities in aviation.
When I was a teenager, I didn’t know any female pilots. If I had, I might have realized sooner that I was fully capable of achieving this dream. Girls in Aviation Day offers early exposure to aviation. Without this kind of mentorship and financial support, many students never make it past the starting line.
For today’s dreamers, Girls in Aviation Day is the spark. It says: This could be you. The skies are for everyone. Together, we can lift the next generation into the skies.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As federal prosecutors push harder for swift deportations and accounts of immigration officers arresting people at court hearings circulate, a Memphis-based legal nonprofit and clergy members are working together to ensure these events don’t go unwitnessed.
Advocates for Immigrant Rights (AIR) is in the early stages of building what the law firm hopes will become a robust immigration court watch program run with clergy volunteers, Executive Director Casey Bryant said.
The firm provides affordable legal help and support services to immigrants, serving people in Tennessee, North Mississippi, Arkansas and sometimes Kentucky — all areas handled by the Memphis immigration court. There are 126,623 pending immigration cases in the Memphis court as of July 31, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a University of Syracuse organization that gathers federal data.
This spring, immigration attorneys began to take note of a new legal tactic across the country. When immigrants who have been released at the border show up for their assigned court dates, prosecutors are pushing for their cases to be dismissed, leaving them without the protection of the court process. When they leave, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are waiting to arrest them and sometimes quickly deport them in a process called expedited removal, Bryant said.
A Department of Homeland Security notice issued in January walked back Biden-era limits on expedited removal in an effort to “apply expedited removal to the fullest extent authorized by Congress.” In July, advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of 12 immigrants from several countries who were arrested after their first court hearing and face expedited removal orders.
Tennessee faith leaders criticize ICE anti-immigrant action, “harassment” of Nashville mayor

“Secretary (Kristi) Noem is reversing Biden’s catch-and-release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in a May statement to CBS News regarding the administration’s shift in policy.
Bryant said the tactic “blindsided” court advocates. Most immigrants do not have legal representation, meaning “a ton of people were just getting whisked away from immigration courts with no witness except for the staff of the court,” Bryant said.
That’s where Catholic priest Juan Antonio “Tony” Romo comes in. Members of his majority-Hispanic congregation at his Memphis church have been arrested and deported, and the church community is afraid, he said. Romo saw a news story about a bishop in San Diego who attended immigration court hearings and felt compelled to act.
Romo and Monsignor Valentine Handwerker — a retired Memphis priest who spent nearly 50 years in ministry and remains concerned with social justice issues — reached out to ask Bryant to attend hearings with them and explain what they were seeing.
Inside immigration court
Romo recalled an immigration immersion trip he made with other clergy members and nuns in southern Arizona a few years ago. They traced immigrants’ paths through the desert and attended a court hearing. Romo said immigrants were led in wearing jail uniforms and chains, with no representation.
“The judge would just say, boom … you are deported, boom, you are deported,” he said. “It was a pretty disgusting experience of the way the people were mistreated.”
Romo said he cares about social issues — issues “faced by the people of God beyond the spiritual.”
“I’m a missionary,” he said. “I don’t call myself an immigrant, but in some ways, I am. I came to the U.S., not in the way of making a better life, but in a way to minister, to serve the people of God. But to the (Trump) administration and for most people, I’m an immigrant.”
Romo was born in Mexico and moved to the United States after completing two years of law school to join the Society of the Divine Word, a Catholic clerical congregation. He completed his undergraduate and masters degrees in Iowa and Illinois, and spent two years training as a missionary in Portugal. Romo has lived in California, Florida and Washington, D.C., according to the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, where he has served as pastor since 2012.
In the Memphis immigration court, Romo’s experience was different. None of the immigrants he saw had legal representation, he said, but translators were available and Romo described one judge as calm and caring. 
“As we engaged in conversation with (the judge), he told us about people who are already frightened when they come to court,” Romo said. “And he said, ‘Why make it worse?’”
Romo did not see any arrests or ICE presence during his first two visits. 
“Everyone got another day in court,” he said. “Their judges asked them for more documents and to edit their application for asylum.”
When Romo first walked into the building, he saw three people there to appear in court. He introduced himself and Handwerker as priests who “decided to just come and be present for people” and asked if they would like the priests to attend their hearings. 
“The smiles on their faces — it was like, yes, Father, please,” he said. 
Later, they thanked the priests as they left. 
“That told us how people feel when they see their priest is standing up with them,” Romo said. “Just being there. Even if you cannot do anything, even if you cannot say anything, just being there means a lot to them.”
Bryant envisions a program where there is always someone in each courtroom bearing witness to the court proceedings and decisions made.
“It’s also about people seeing friendly faces” in a “process that is so dehumanizing,” Bryant said.
Next steps
The next steps to build a formal court watch program include recruiting more court watchers and obtaining buy-in from the court’s administration, Bryant said.
AIR partners with multiple organizations, including Catholic Charities of East and West Tennessee, and Bryant said the nonprofit is also working with the Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, a group that has connections with clergy from different denominations.
Ultimately, AIR will develop training for volunteers to familiarize them with court decorum and protocol.
Getting the court to recognize the program is the next key step, Bryant said. While immigration court hearings are generally open to the public for observation, Bryant said the court’s formal blessing would “ensure volunteer observers could get into the courts without hassle.” It could also help with scheduling volunteers if the program gets advance notice on which judges have hearings on which days.
Bryant said the Memphis court directed AIR to contact court administration on the national level. Bryant is awaiting their response.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which administers the immigration court system, doesn’t have a formal pathway to set up a court watch system, but it does offer a Model Hearing Program that explains the court’s procedures and offers opportunities to observe live model hearings with a review of relevant law.
Religious and advocacy groups have successfully set up immigration court watch programs in other cities, including Chicago Courtwatch and the Human Rights Defender Project in Minnesota. Depending on the program, volunteers are sometimes asked to collect data and observations on court proceedings.
Court watch programs also reach beyond immigration court across the United States. The programs “ensure scrutiny and evaluation,” according to the American Bar Association (ABA). “They serve to highlight the realities of our legal system by recording data, uncovering stories, identifying trends, and highlighting problems” that can potentially drive reform, ABA states.
In the meantime, Romo has told his parishioners that he will do his best to attend immigration hearings for anyone who wants him to be there.
Bryant said court watching is also an opportunity for people to see the system in action, and perhaps challenge misconceptions.
“I really think that bringing people to court, even if it’s just one time, will open their eyes to the way that people are being treated in this country, and it will change their mind,” Bryant said. “If they think one way, I think they’re going to see it’s something totally different.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gavel.jpg,,,2025-09-08 06:56:46.909658

(Photo: John Partipilo)Back to school season was always an exciting time for me as a kid. Every year, my parents would take my sisters and me shopping for new clothes, shoes, backpacks, Trapper Keepers, folders, book covers, pens and pencils. For a nerdy girl, the start of a new school year was like another birthday. I loved my new school supplies and couldn’t wait to see my friends after the summer break. 
But now with schools back in session, it’s a time fraught with anxiety and fear. Back to school now means back to school shooting season. The season officially started this year on August 28 with a mass shooting at a private school in Minneapolis. For the parents, kids, teachers and staff at that school, their dreaded nightmare became tragically real. 
Here in Nashville, I couldn’t help but reflect on the mass shooting that happened here at the Covenant school just two years ago. Our city collectively mourned that tragedy and turned up at the state capitol in droves, demanding action and change. It seemed like Gov. Bill Lee was listening when he called the special session of the state legislature.
3 kids, 3 adults killed in shooting at Nashville private elementary school

Frustratingly, of the four bills that became law as a result of that session, only one had anything to do with guns.
Since that special session, gun safety advocates have been ever present at the Capitol, trying to convince legislators to do more on gun safety. Poll after poll shows the majority of Tennesseans want gun safety laws like extreme risk protection orders. But what do we get from our lawmakers? The obligatory “thoughts and prayers” and laws that will do little to nothing to help fix the root cause of the problem.
Several kids have gotten caught in the crosshairs of “school safety” laws. Schools now expel students for making statements thought to be threats of violence, calling the police and having them arrested. Instead of performing an investigation into a student’s possibly misunderstood statement and determining the appropriate disciplinary action, kids are being placed in handcuffs and sent to jail. When asked if they plan to fix this obvious problem with the law, our lawmakers have doubled down, saying “it’s working the way we want it to.” 
Another bill our state legislature passed to address school safety provided funding for schools to employ School Resource Officers, or SROs, typically off duty police officers. A bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd of Jackson, which has yet to pass, would expand this role to include retired police officers and honorably discharged veterans.
There is controversy surrounding SROs. Some studies have shown that while having an SRO present can lead to less violence in schools, Black, Hispanic, and children with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined, leading to higher interactions with law enforcement and contributing to the school to prison pipeline. There have also been issues with SROs being careless with their firearms, putting students, teachers and staff at risk. In 2017, a student at a school in Morgan County found a gun left unattended by an SRO in a school bathroom.
Having an SRO in your school is no guarantee for your kids’ safety. In the most recent school shooting here in Nashville, at Antioch High School this past January, two SROs were present.
Instead of protecting children, these laws have turned schools into pipelines to the justice system. Students are being expelled and arrested for minor infractions, and this impact is gravely disproportionate. Rather than investigating and addressing behavior in a way that actually supports safety, lawmakers are choosing to criminalize children for being children, while refusing to pass the kinds of gun safety laws that would actually keep schools safe. 
Tennessee reps irked by state’s failure on gun safe storage campaign

Another “school safety” bill passed last year, allowing Tennessee teachers to carry guns in schools, this one sponsored by Rep. Ryan Williams of Cookeville. Under the new law, school districts can opt in to arm teachers who must go through 40 hours of training, pass a psychological evaluation, submit fingerprints and get a handgun permit, steps that we somehow don’t require of other gun owners in Tennessee. Parents were understandably upset, especially since they would not be notified if there was a gun in their child’s classroom. The idea of having teachers carry guns in their classrooms is so ridiculous that we have yet to hear any school district adopt this policy.
This year, Tennessee parents may be surprised to learn about a new law that went into effect which requires students to learn about guns. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd and Sen. Paul Bailey of Sparta, passed in 2024 but didn’t take effect until this school year. With the passage of this law, Tennessee became the first state in the country to require gun safety classes statewide. 
Instead of requiring adults who own guns to go through mandatory safety training and require them to safely store their firearms out of the reach, lawmakers are putting the onus on kindergarteners to keep themselves and those around them safe. It’s absolutely maddening. Unfortunately we have months until our state legislature is back in session to push them to pass gun safety laws that actually make sense. Until then, we’ll force Tennessee’s school kids to be the adults in the room. 
In Tennessee, school is back in session. Let’s hope our lawmakers learn how to pass gun laws that will actually keep our kids safe. Until they do, the outcome is predictable: more traumatized youth, more broken futures, and schools no safer than before.

Enough of the stink that stretches for miles and lingers for days. Enough of the sewage-laden trucks rumbling down local roads. Enough of the environmental fines, the lawsuits, the contract disputes and costly equipment repairs. 
“The quality of life in this city has suffered long enough,” Woonsocket Mayor Christopher Beauchamp said in a recent interview. “We don’t want to be the disposal of everyone else’s waste.”
After more than a century under city ownership, Beauchamp and the Woonsocket City Council are looking to wash their hands of the Woonsocket Wastewater Treatment Facility: They want to shut down the incineration arm that burns dried waste, and sell off the sewage treatment segment. An Aug. 25 resolution unanimously approved by the City Council authorizes negotiations to transfer the plant title and permits to the Narragansett Bay Commission, a quasi-public agency that already runs the largest wastewater operations in the state.
The resolution is preliminary and nonbinding, dependent on the agreement of the Narragansett Bay Commission and of the two private companies under contract to manage Woonsocket’s wastewater treatment plan into the next decade. Also a key consideration: the financial implications for a cash-strapped city that brings in money from treating waste throughout the region, while getting free access for its own sewage. 
“It’s like playing 20 games of chess at the same time,” City Solicitor Michael Lepizzera said. “It’s going to take a long time. There are a lot of parts and people involved.”
But Lepizzera thinks the payoff could be worth the challenge. 
“This could be a generational change,” Lepizzera said.

A ‘generational change’
Once heralded as a pinnacle of engineering ingenuity and government self-sufficiency, the sprawling, riverfront sewage plant has soured with time. Aging equipment demands costly fixes, or even costlier environmental and legal fees when malfunctions lead to water and air pollution. 
Look no further than the series of complaints about untreated sewage pouring into the Blackstone River beginning in 2021, culminating in a March 2023 lawsuit by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office against the city and the companies contracted to run the plant. Four months later, a second lawsuit: this time, a federal class-action case from local residents alleging the smells emanating from the plant have hurt their property values and quality of life. Both cases remain pending, according to court records.
The City Council’s resolution, sponsored by Council President Dan Gendron, points to the drain on financial and legal resources from the protracted legal battles.










The quality of life in this city has suffered long enough. We don’t want to be the disposal of everyone else’s waste.


– Woonsocket Mayor Christopher Beauchamp 


And while the immediate pollution concerns appear resolved thanks to emergency equipment purchases — for which the city is still repaying the debt — the bill keeps growing.
The incineration arm still requires “substantial upgrades and infrastructure improvements,” to the tune of $40 to $50 million, the City Council resolution states. Neighbors are still filing complaints over the smell.
However, wriggling out of the contracts with the companies hired to run the operations might not be costly or hard. Synagro Woonsocket LLC, the company hired to oversee the incinerator, has indicated it would be open to cutting the 20-year contract off, according to multiple city officials.
“They’re spending a lot of money on legal fees,” Lepizzera said of the two private contractors. “Eliminating these contracts might be beneficial to them.”
Jennifer Cervenka, an attorney for Synagro, did not return multiple inquiries for comment. Jacobs Engineering Group, which oversees the wastewater treatment side of the plant, also did not respond to requests for comment.
Both vendors signed 20-year contracts with the city in 2012, guaranteeing their work and income from services provided through 2032, according to contracts previously obtained by Rhode Island Current through a public records request.

Looking for an exit
However, the agreements also offer all parties legal exit routes, including for potential negligence — something Beauchamp sees as a firm rationale given the sewage spills that led to the state lawsuit.
“Synagro has not kept up their end of the bargain in fixing that plant,” Beauchamp said.
Lepizzera was reluctant to “disregard” the legally binding agreements with Synagro and Jacobs. He looks to find a mutually beneficial resolution that would allow the city to shut down the incinerator and sell the treatment plant for the right price.
Much hinges on the terms of a potential sale to the Narragansett Bay Commission, or another owner. Lepizzera declined to name a dollar figure, but wanted a price that covers the city’s $29 million debt on the money it borrowed to pay for plant upgrades last year, and to offset the lost revenue it gets from treating sewage for more than dozen other cities, companies and wastewater plants across the region. 
The city brings in $3 million in annual host fees from the two contractors plus a share of royalties from incineration up to $600,000 a year under its contracts with Synagro and Jacobs. And, Woonsocket has its waste treated for free.
“All of that is going to be part of the equation,” Lepizzera said. “If NBC doesn’t give us the best deal and bang for our buck, and protect our community, we could go in another direction.”
Jamie Samons, a Narragansett Bay Commission spokesperson, declined to comment on specific terms of an agreement, noting that negotiations are just beginning.
“Should NBC and Woonsocket reach a mutually beneficial agreement, these communities — and all who enjoy the Blackstone River — will benefit from NBC’s nationally recognized excellence in clean water operations, financial stewardship and community engagement,” Samons said in an emailed response. “In the coming months, NBC staff and Board of Commissioners will work closely with key stakeholders to conduct thorough due diligence. If a transfer is approved, NBC is committed to making the transition as seamless and transparent as possible.”

A proven track record 
Narragansett Bay Commission has proven its skill in transforming struggling municipal wastewater treatment facilities into nationally acclaimed success stories, first with the Field’s Point Wastewater Treatment Facility in Providence in 1982, and a decade later, East Providence’s Bucklin Point Wastewater Treatment Facility. The award-winning clean water agency now provides wastewater treatment services to more than 400,000 state residents, while investing in large-scale capital projects to protect Narragansett Bay from sewage during heavy rainfalls.
“They’re one of the best, if not the best, operated wastewater treatment facilities in the state,” said Joseph Habarek, administrator of surface water protection for the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. “Overall, they have an excellent compliance record.”










They’re one of the best, if not the best, operated wastewater treatment facilities in the state.


– Joseph Haberek of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management regarding Narragansett Bay Commission


At the time Synagro took over the Woonsocket incinerator in 1988, it too received acclaim from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for transforming a hearth furnace combustion system into one that uses electricity and a wet flushing system to treat solid waste. Subsequent upgrades turned the local incineration facility into a regional powerhouse, able to burn up to 105 tons of dried waste a day, 90% of which comes from government and commercial customers across Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. The remaining 10% is Woonsocket’s own waste. 
But as its customer base grew, so did the fines and penalties. Synagro Woonsocket was fined $175,000 by the Department of Environmental Management in 2018 for excess pollutants and chemicals found in the water, including cyanide, dating back to 2014. In 2021, a different subsidiary of the Baltimore-based company reached a $373,660 settlement with the EPA for violating federal air pollution protections at its Woonsocket plant. In July 2022, nine months before the state lawsuit, Synagro entered into another settlement with state environmental watchdogs for pollution problems with the incinerator, agreeing to pay $20,000 for water treatment improvements in the Blackstone River, along with investing in infrastructure upgrades to its incinerator.
Since the state lawsuit in March 2023, the plant has remained under close monitoring by environmental regulators, with monthly inspections of operations and bacteria and pollutant discharge levels.
In 2024, the plant exceeded maximum state discharge allowances for phosphorus in the water for six consecutive months, leading to several warnings, but no fines, because the issues were considered “minor,” Haberek said. 
“Overall, they’re doing better,” Haberek said. “Broad-brush, they’ve been meeting their permit limits.”
Odor complaints have persisted, though fewer than at the peak in 2023. Jacobs received 25 complaints about smells from the wastewater plant through July of this year —  less than 25% of 107 documented in 2024, and under one-fifth of the 132 complaints made in 2023, according to an Aug. 12 report to the City Council.
Transferring ownership of the sewage treatment service might reduce these occurrences, but it’s unlikely to scrub them entirely. Even the best-run wastewater treatment plants have occasional smells and discharge levels that exceed state permit caps, Haberek said.
Regional consequences 
What is guaranteed if the city shutters its incinerator: Dozens of local governments, manufacturers and other wastewater treatment facilities — including the Narragansett Bay Commission — will be forced to find an alternative place to send their sewage byproducts. 
“We all rely on the Woonsocket incinerator as a disposal option,” Haberek said. “That would be problematic if they were to stop accepting biosolids.”
The Cranston Wastewater Treatment Facility is the only other wastewater treatment plant in Rhode Island with an incinerator, but it does not have capacity to handle Woonsocket’s load, Haberek said.
Beauchamp was unconcerned.
“Let everybody else figure it out,” he said. “It’s about time we put Woonsocket first.”
The city has not yet notified its municipal and commercial customers about the tentative plan to shut down the incinerator. However, last year, the City Council approved a separate, non-binding resolution to stop accepting liquid sludge from other cities and towns and companies, instead limiting its services to the already dried “cakes.” The switch, if made, would have affected about half of the existing incinerator customers. But it never advanced beyond the May 22, 2024, council vote.
Lepizzera stressed that any changes, including closure of the incinerator and transfer of the wastewater treatment plant to a new owner, would not take effect immediately. 
Gendron, the City Council president, does not share the same timeline.
“I would hope it would be done by Friday of this week,” Gendron said. “I am worried first about the health and wellbeing of the residents of Woonsocket. That’s where my real priority lies.”
Also factored into the calendar calculations: the July 1, 2027, deadline by which the city is contractually required to assume maintenance of the incinerator from Synagro, although the latter would continue to provide daily operating service through 2032 under the existing contract.
Beauchamp wants the transfer deal done before then.
“We know this incinerator is not going to get any better unless you put money into it,” he said. “We certainly don’t have that money. We don’t want to spend that money.”

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)There’s a reason people come to West Virginia, and it’s not just the mountains. They come for authenticity. Culture. Art. Music. Elements setting us apart. Goldenseal magazine highlights those unique differences. 
It has been a cultural touchstone for over 45 years. It tells our quirkiest stories: ghost tales of Harper’s Ferry, the honey economy and bees, quilters, bakers, fiddlers and singers. It is one of the last surviving public platforms in the state dedicated solely to folk traditions, oral histories and regional storytelling. 
Goldenseal was not always subscription-based. It was once free and state-funded. Why? Because the state understood its value wasn’t financial. In the 1980s, the state asked for voluntary payments. In 1995, it became fully self-funded. That’s when the decline began. Readership plummeted. But let’s be clear: it’s not on shaky ground because it failed its mission. It’s at risk financially because we stopped investing in it.
The Department of Tourism now oversees it. And that worries me. Because if the only lens we use is revenue, Goldenseal will lose every time. Culture doesn’t always pay in dollars. And if West Virginia is to excel? Artistic support must be prioritized. The Department of Tourism can work to make a new, revamped website for the magazine. Promote artists, storytellers and culture Goldenseal writes about. Written by West Virginia writers. 
Critics call it a money pit. Others call it outdated. But that misses the point. You see, culture is a long game. And art keeps the soul and identity of a place alive. And tourists? They want to understand our people and culture. They aren’t just coming for cabins and trails. 
I agree, Goldenseal should evolve. Keep the print edition — for the thousands of loyal readers who still find joy in paper and long-form storytelling. But also bring Goldenseal into the 21st century. How? Make it interactive. Digitize the archives. Launch social media storytelling. A podcast. Short videos. Instagram reels featuring young Appalachian voices — writers, musicians, photographers. Folk recipes. Local trivia. Create music playlists amplifying new, hip local bands as well as traditions like the Augusta Folk Music program in Randolph County schools, as well as the Vandalia Festival in Charleston. 
Tourists like print. Something with milky way images by West Virginia photographers. Make it free. (That’s what my generation is used to.) That is why the wonderful Highland Outdoors — a large, glossy West Virginia magazine — is free (funded by advertising.) This is why the small town Tucker County Observer is free. Free means accessible. Free means people read it. Keep the current version of Goldenseal, and make a second print version that is slim and focuses more on contemporary stories. Place it across the state. 
Let the print stay. Let the stories grow. Let it evolve. And yes — get state funding again. This is not radical. It’s common sense. We fund libraries. We fund museums. We fund highways. Why not fund a cultural institution that has served this state for decades?
Chelsea Ruby has an opportunity. Ruby serves as West Virginia’s Cabinet Secretary of the Department of Tourism (and now, by extension, the Department of Arts, Culture and History as of its merger in 2025.) Here’s what’s cool about Ruby: she survives administrations. Maintained her position under both former Gov.Jim Justice and Gov. Patrick Morrisey. This is an unusual feat in today’s volatile political landscape. Ruby is awesome at her job. She has led consistent and record-breaking growth in tourism. In 2023, tourism brought in $6.3 billion to West Virginia. Nearly $600 million of that went directly to state and local governments. 
But here’s the potential rub: Tourism, by nature, often demands a return on investment — measured in economic impact, job creation and tax revenue. The arts, however, are not always profitable. Art cannot always be measured in dollars, but its influence enriches lives. It is our lifeblood. 
Ruby is now the steward of all West Virginia creativity. It is her unique responsibility to ensure that programming, grants, and cultural investments continue and grow for artists. Value should not always be equated with profitability. Read that again. The Department of Tourism must remember this. It may be a new paradigm for them. 
Ruby’s opportunity is clear — and well as her responsibility to preserve the arts. I have belief she will continue to champion both economic vitality and Appalachian writers, arts and culture.  Now that tourism and the arts are under the same umbrella, they cannot be adversaries. That’s not an option. They must be partners. They must work together to elevate West Virginia.

Opinions differ. (Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)A disease outbreak on a Kentucky deer farm is renewing questions about whether stronger rules are needed for the more than 100 “captive cervid facilities” the state has permitted.
State and federal agencies recently confirmed eight cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) at a deer farm in Breckinridge County where the illness had first been detected in a single deer in October 2024.
Chronic wasting disease is a fatal prion disorder similar to mad cow disease. Only 10 cases have been confirmed in Kentucky — nine of them on the Breckinridge County farm — out of 40,000 tests since 2002. But the disease’s spread in other states has made preventing it a priority for wildlife managers nationwide because it causes population declines in deer and elk when prevalent.
Much about the neurological condition — dubbed “zombie deer disease” — is unknown. In deer, it causes significant weight loss, listlessness and death. A deer can appear healthy and have CWD for months or years before symptoms appear. Research has produced conflicting conclusions on the risk of it spreading to humans.
In Breckinridge County, more than 100 captive deer were killed in early July at Sinking Creek Whitetails, said co-owner Laura Voyles, whose family started the deer farm in 2020. A Kentucky Department of Agriculture statement said the “depopulation was carried out” at the request of the owner “to protect animal health and prevent further spread. KDA’s role was to collect the necessary samples and submit them to the lab for testing.”
Several state and federal agencies were involved, the state ag department said.

Voyles said the farm’s only other option would have been to quarantine the deer for years and hope no further cases appeared. She said the farm kept the deer alive and quarantined for months until the agencies “got their ducks in a row enough to come massacre them.”
“It’s just devastating to know that what you have poured your life into, from just a blood, sweat and tears perspective, in addition to all of the finances that had been poured into it was just gone in a moment,” Voyles said.
Voyles said the initial chronic wasting disease case found last year came from a healthy-appearing female deer, purchased from outside her farm, that was harvested for meat and subsequently tested. She said she was skeptical of the positive test results because the Kentucky Department of Agriculture “refused” to allow for third-party testing. A Kentucky Department of Agriculture spokesperson said it had “full confidence” in the testing done at the “nation’s premier facility for livestock disease testing”, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa. 
After the first diseased deer was discovered at Voyles’ farm last fall, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources officials responded by putting Breckenridge County and adjoining Meade and Hardin counties into a surveillance zone in an effort to block spread of the disease. Hunters who take deer in those three counties are required to have the animals tested for chronic wasting disease, and only specific parts — deboned meat, a clean skull with no brain tissue, cleaned teeth, hides, antlers and finished taxidermy mounts — can be taken out of the surveillance zone.
The only other confirmed wasting disease in Kentucky is an isolated case discovered in 2023 in a wild deer in Ballard County. 
A bill stalls to add deer farm regulations
Earlier this year, legislation was introduced in Frankfort aimed at containing the disease. The bill died after opposition from a vocal deer farming industry that views deer as a form of agriculture and an income source.
Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources Commissioner Rich Storm told lawmakers that the measure was “critically important” to protect not only the state’s deer population but also the elk herd that has rebounded in Eastern Kentucky. He said tourism generated by hunting brings in billions of dollars every year. 
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, would have expanded the radius of a surveillance zone when chronic wasting disease is detected in a wild deer or on a deer farm. It also would have halted the transfer of captive deer within and from areas where a case is found on a deer farm. Deer farms could have been exempted from the restrictions by surrounding themselves with a  second fence to prevent wild deer from interacting with captive deer. The bill advanced out of a committee but didn’t receive a vote by the Kentucky House of Representatives.

One of the main ways deer farms make money is by selling deer with desirable genetics, such as large antlers, to private preserves for people to hunt and to other deer farms. A desirable buck may sell for thousands of dollars. 
Jason Becker, president of the Kentucky Alternative Livestock Association that represents deer farmers, disputes the need for new limits on deer farms. “Most concerns over the spread of CWD relating to deer farms are completely unfounded,” Becker told the Lantern, adding that requiring a second fence would be financially burdensome. 
Debates over how to control chronic wasting disease — and the role of deer farms — have been heated in other states. Wildlife biologists interviewed by the Lantern agree requiring a second fence on deer farms would protect the wild deer population, though these biologists also acknowledged more is still being learned about how the disease is spread. 
The unknowns of chronic wasting disease
Rep. Bray, sponsor of this year’s deer farm bill, said he grew up a hunter and sees deer on his farm. The unknowns of what chronic wasting disease could mean not only for hunting, but even potentially for public health, worry him. 
“The idea that I have to be scared of a natural resource like that causing damage to my family’s health — that’s not acceptable,” Bray said, referring to concerns about chronic wasting disease potentially infecting species other than cervids. 
Recent research has shown the prions that infect deer can change to become infectious in humans, the fear being it could cause Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a fatal prion disease, in people. Another study from 2024, though, found the likelihood of chronic wasting disease crossing over and infecting humans was low. Prions are abnormal proteins that can harm neurons and cause brain damage that has no cure.

Bray, who favors requiring a second fence for deer farms, points to the broad spread of chronic wasting disease in Wisconsin as something Kentucky should be trying to avoid. 
“I just think some really common sense, simple things can be done to provide additional protection. You know, we’ve got one shot at it. Once it’s in the wild population, it’s in there,” Bray said.
Matthew Springer, an associate extension professor of wildlife management at the University of Kentucky, told the Lantern he collaborated with the Kentucky Department of Agriculture and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources in 2020 where the fence lines of several deer farms were studied to see interactions between wild deer and captive deer. 
“We had noted several interactions of various levels, including direct contact between individuals through the fence,” Springer said. 
He said requiring two fences around deer farms “greatly reduces” the risk of interaction but comes at an “extreme cost” for deer farms. He said the Kentucky chapter of the Wildlife Society, which represents wildlife biologists, sent a letter of support for Bray’s bill. 
Some sportspeople view deer farming and private hunting preserves as unethical, Springer said. But deer farms are not the sole cause of chronic wasting disease spread, he said.  
“There’s a lot of very good deer farmers that are out there trying to abide by all the regulations and do the best they can to protect both their resource and the wild resource,” Springer said. 
A ‘national security threat’
Some states have taken stronger measures beyond requiring two fences on deer farms. Minnesota lawmakers placed a moratorium on new deer farms, and deer farmers sued arguing it violated their economic liberty. 
The moratorium was implemented following a 2022 report from Minnesota wildlife management officials that cited the transport of deer between deer farms as a reason chronic wasting disease  cases were appearing hundreds of miles apart.  
Becker, the president of the Kentucky association representing deer farmers, argued the restrictions placed or proposed on deer farms ultimately don’t stop the spread of chronic wasting disease given its spread in wild deer. He also said deer farms in Kentucky have to follow a number of regulations already. That includes a state ban on bringing whole deer carcasses or “high-risk” parts of a deer from other states, quarterly inspections of deer farms by state agriculture officials, required state permits and required testing of any deer that dies on a farm over one year old. 
“No state has passed a law that has effectively limited the spread of CWD in their state,” Becker said. “It’s not a farm deer problem. It is a deer problem.” 
Becker instead pointed to efforts in Oklahoma to develop deer that are genetically “resistant” to chronic wasting disease. Wildlife biologists interviewed by the Lantern are skeptical of efforts to create “resistant” deer.

Peter Larsen, a co-director of the Minnesota Center for Prion Research and Outreach at the University of Minnesota, said a “genetic background” of deer can make chronic wasting disease develop more slowly. 
“But there’s other research that shows that those animals are still shedding prions. It could be at a lower level, but they’re still positive and they’re still shedding it,” Larsen said. “There is not enough data available to justify that approach.” 
Larsen considers chronic wasting disease a “national security threat” because of the potential accumulation of prions in the environment and the potential for species spillover. He said the prions can be absorbed by plants; data shows prions can combine with dust particles, be carried in the wind and accumulate in agricultural commodities. 
“You have a lot of prions accumulating in the environment. And where does that go?” Larsen said. “We need to get aggressive on it.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deer-buck-in-field-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-09-08 05:56:09.889825

Stebbins State agencies are warning Wisconsinites to limit the amount of ducks that they eat, or to avoid certain birds entirely, due to PFAS contamination. Waterfowl harvested around Green Bay were shown to have high levels of the man-made “forever chemicals,” which persist in the environment forever and have been linked to several chronic diseases including cancers. 
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Department of Health Services (DHS) are advising people not to eat mallards from around lower Green Bay from Longtail Point to Point au Sable, and south of the mouth of the Fox River. Additionally, mallards and wood ducks living around Green Bay from the city of Marinette across to Sturgeon Bay should not be consumed frequently — no more more often than once per month for mallards and only one meal per week for wood ducks. 
Back in 2022 levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), another man-made chemical, in waterfowl led to similar advisories in lower Green Bay. Further assessments found concentrations of PFAS in breast muscle tissue, according to a DNR press release. In 2023 and 2024, more samples were taken from ducks, with all samples taken during July and August when the birds were most likely to represent local breeding populations. Those efforts revealed elevated levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which is a type of PFAS, in the breast muscles of the birds. The inquiry suggested that both adult and juvenile ducks in lower Green Bay have higher concentrations of PFOS than in the northern portion of the bay. 
PFAS chemicals were first developed as part of U.S. government nuclear and atomic weapons research during the Manhattan Project. After the project ended private companies, particularly DuPont, began researching the compounds for commercial use. Over the subsequent decades, PFAS was used in products including  non-stick Teflon pans, fast food wrappers, and firefighting foam. The chemicals do not degrade in the environment, nor within the body, and have been linked to cancers and other chronic diseases. 
The DNR tracks PFAS consumption advisories spanning multiple species including deer, fish and waterfowl. On Sept. 4, deer and fish advisories for PFAS were issued for the Town of Stella and surrounding waterbodies in Oneida County. All fish in the Moen Lake Chain were included in a “do not eat” advisory due to PFAS contamination, and a similar warning was distributed against the consumption of deer liver near the Town of Stella.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)In 2022, Denver residents overwhelmingly approved Measure 306, Waste No More Denver, a citizens’ initiative to mandate access to landfill diversion systems in all places where municipal services are not allowed to serve. In 2023, a task force provided a full slate of implementation recommendations to enable the citizens’ initiative to become enforceable by statute.

Waste diversion through donation, recycling, composting, and reusing materials is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to cut climate pollution and be a profitable business. Yet our policies lag far behind our potential, and proposed rollbacks to Denver’s Waste No More ordinance risk undoing hard-won progress before it has a chance to work.
A report by the nonprofit GAIA emphasizes that cities investing in organic waste diversion and circular waste systems can significantly reduce climate pollution while also creating jobs and promoting healthier communities. In Denver, our 10-year Solid Waste plan updates consistently indicate that businesses need to expand recycling and compost diversion efforts. Unfortunately, as a city, we have been slow to do so. An example of this can be seen in the three years it has taken to implement the Waste No More ballot measure.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
As someone deeply involved in Denver’s Waste No More citizens’ initiative since 2021, I’ve seen firsthand how local communities are transforming the way we think about waste. In 2022, nearly 71% of Denver voters approved the Waste No More ballot measure, which put new requirements on almost all commercial properties, food producers, events, and construction and demolition projects to separate and recycle materials. Doing so sparked dialogue and built community-wide momentum toward zero waste. Since its passage, cities like Aspen have followed suit with similar strong mandates, proving this approach is scalable, achievable, and popular.
Exempting these businesses from diversion plans like donating consumable food waste sends the wrong message and delays the cultural shift we need, not to mention the impractical disconnect between revenue and waste. Diversion plans will allow for a review of shared bin systems, co-ops, and property-managed diversion. These methods are all proven models that small businesses can use to effectively divert without adding undue burdens to their bottom line. 
With the rollout of Extended Producer Responsibility by 2030 for small businesses and significant shifts in the amount of landfill-bound waste, it is essential to review cost savings in waste management that will offset the costs of organic waste diversion. Exemptions should be temporary and tied to meaningful thresholds, not open-ended carve-outs that let high-waste entities opt out indefinitely. 
We can look to those who have already implemented these changes since 2022, such as farmers’ markets, neighborhood festivals, and food banks, which are already leading by example with diverting food waste and recycling. But current pre-exemption proposals risk excluding them altogether, missing an opportunity to scale diversion as infrastructure improves. 
Additionally, the state of Colorado has established a groundwork to assert that these responsibilities are not opt-in responsibilities but are part of the cost of doing business. Every business and department in the state has a responsibility to do its part in order to do business in Colorado. Regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are part of state statute, and landfill methane emissions are the third-largest emitter of methane in the state.
This is the point of Waste No More. By creating diversion plans that are supported by commercial systems for composting and recycling at retail food establishments, businesses, construction sites, multifamily buildings, and events, we can prevent waste from becoming pollution and creating the methane and other emissions that impact public health and our global environment.
Unfortunately, proposed permanent pre-exemptions would undermine the effort. By offering businesses an opt-in method of being responsible for waste diversion, we are missing the clear mandate that Denver voters approved. Producing clean diversion streams is an act of practice, and to build a societal shift, we need to incorporate these practices into all aspects of our community.
Denver voters decided to raise the bar for landfill diversion and significantly reduce methane emissions — and the solution is in our trash. But only if we resist weakening the rules before they’ve had a chance to work. This is why Denver City Council needs to vote for amendments to the proposed updates to this regulation, to protect the intention of the citizens’ initiative and to move into an implementation model that provides diversion access to all.

(Graphics by States Newsroom)This story was reported collaboratively between the Pennsylvania Capital-Star and its sister outlet Michigan Advance.
Just two states in the nation have been unable to pass budgets for the 2025-26 fiscal year – and now, they’re staring down significant consequences if their respective legislative bodies fail to act soon.
 Pennsylvania has entered its third month without a new budget, while Michigan is just weeks away from a potential shutdown. Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states have figured out their spending plans – or contingencies.
Listen to Emily’s audio recap:

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MIPA-radio-mx2.mp3

Aside from their current budget woes, the Rust Belt states mirror each other in some unique ways. Both are helmed by Democratic governors with presidential ambitions and national profiles to match in Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer. They are considered battleground states with recently redrawn legislative districts generally regarded as fairer – and that resulted in split legislatures, two of three nationally. Transportation funding has emerged as the sticking point in the disparate budget negotiations, for very different reasons.
And the stakes in each of the impasses aren’t exactly the same.

A Michigan shutdown would shutter services, inspections
If Michigan’s budget gridlock lasts long enough, the government would shut down in a dramatic fashion, loosely mirroring a federal shutdown that would shutter services and operations. State workers would be left without pay and potentially their benefits. State parks, statewide law enforcement services and seemingly mundane activities like food safety inspections could also be impacted, according to WDIV-TV Detroit.

Unlike the federal government, Michigan can’t pass resolutions supporting government functions without a budget. That’s led the state, on at least two recent occasions, to pass holdover “continuation budgets,” defined as a short term appropriation of the previous fiscal year’s spending, if the game gets too close to the final whistle.

Pennsylvania’s partisan gridlock drives impasse
In Pennsylvania, there is no possibility of a shutdown. The commonwealth’s Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that state workers must be paid during a budget impasse. But schools and counties don’t have that same guarantee – and taxpayers have to cover the interest on any loans to continue operations until state funding starts flowing again.
That’s on top of having state leaders consumed with the budget fight at the expense of other issues – such as the looming impact of recent reductions in federal programs and funding. And then there are the long-term costs if the resulting budget’s apparent “balance” relies on deferring expenses such as pension contributions or infrastructure investment. What’s more, discussion often happens behind closed doors with updates leaked or proposals rushed to public debate, which creates confusion. 
Either way, both states will face consequences if their spending plans aren’t approved and signed into law soon.

Transportation funding talks at a dead end 
Future Michigan road maintenance and repair face dire consequences if a funding plan isn’t a part of the coming fiscal year budget. Many projects that were funded by bonds during Whitmer’s tenure are coming to a close, and there is no plan to reauthorize those bonds, necessitating a legislative solution.

The bonds were authorized by the state’s Transportation Commission in 2020 because the Republicans, who were previously in control of the Legislature in 2019, refused to raise taxes to pay for roads.

Budget talks this year have stalled partly due to road funding, but also because the House waited to pass its full government spending plan until late August; the Senate passed its full budget in May. Whitmer delivered her budget recommendations much earlier in the year.

Now that the Michigan House has a budget plan on the table, Republicans in the chamber say it is incumbent on the Senate to come forward with a roads funding plan to get negotiations going. 

Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks and the Democrats in the Senate have offered no clear sign of when it would deliver a road funding plan, nor what it would look like. The GOP plan would put $3.4 billion toward roads.  Those dollars come from deep cuts elsewhere in their proposed budget, like major reductions to key departments that oversee statewide law enforcement, the attorney general’s office, environmental regulations and natural resources rules.

Whitmer has proposed $3 billion for roads and has been adamant that no deal can be reached without funding for roads, putting pressure on the Senate, which is controlled by her party.

This past Wednesday, several thousand construction workers, union members and business leaders were at the state Capitol building to urge lawmakers to find a sustainable solution to Michigan’s looming road funding cliff.
Schools in Michigan are also warning that they are now operating without real budgets that reflect the dollars they’ll actually be receiving from the state in the next fiscal year. Some school groups have said that layoff notices have already been issued because of the standoff.

The urban-rural divide present in both states hasn’t driven the wedge in Michigan’s transportation debate so much as it has in Pennsylvania. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia had been warning for months about service cuts and fare increases while seeking additional funding to make up a $240 million budget deficit the agency has attributed to the loss of federal COVID-19 funding. Public entities nationwide used the funding – intended to serve as one-time, temporary emergency relief – to plug budget holes, creating what public finance experts have described as a looming fiscal crisis.

SEPTA’s planned fare increases and regional metro service reductions are on hold after they were blocked by a court ruling. Another judge then ordered the agency to restore service following a 20 percent reduction to bus and rail rides that had taken effect as the school year began in Philadelphia. In the interim, gambling site Fan Duel kicked in some money so Eagles fans had adequate subway service for the season opener. 
Meanwhile, transit agencies in urban, suburban and rural areas outside the Philadelphia region say they might cut service, increase prices or both if the deadlock persists. 
The debate has left the one million people (one in 13 Pennsylvanians) who use mass transit wondering what comes next.
Lawmakers have floated myriad options – from gambling revenue to legalizing recreational cannabis (already on the books in Michigan and included in Shapiro’s proposed budget) – not only to fund transit but address an overall structural deficit projected to grow to $6 billion during the upcoming year. 
As in the past, oversimplified versions of the current transit funding dustup pitted mass transit agencies and the riders they serve in densely populated areas against drivers throughout the rest of the commonwealth. 
Those drivers, the Republican argument goes, contribute to maintaining roads and bridges through tolls and license and registration fees. But most SEPTA riders also have a car or access to one through someone else in their household, according to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. 
Senate Republicans have meanwhile struggled to reach consensus within their own caucus, which – with Democratic control of the House and governor’s office – has contributed to the deadlock, said Marc Stier, executive director of Penn Policy Center. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro has publicly described his role almost as a mediator while calling for legislators – the GOP-controlled Senate, in particular – to work more and make tough decisions.

 Michigan has twice danced with shutdowns and could again

Under Hall, Michigan’s House GOP leadership has been on a mission to undo Democratic policies passed during their past two sessions in power. That includes trimming what it considers excessive and wasteful spending during the Whitmer years. They’ve taken a slow approach to finding cuts, contributing to the House delaying passage of its version of a budget until Aug. 26.

But Whitmer’s legacy depends partly on her campaign pledge to “fix the damn roads,” a centerpiece of her budget goals before she leaves office in 2026.

Despite different dynamics, those working long enough in the state’s capital of Lansing have opined on how closely the situation resembles the last two government shutdowns in 2007 and 2009 under then-Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm.The state government was divided then, too. Democrats controlled the House, while Republicans had the Senate. 
The 2007 stalemate focused on a $2 billion revenue shortfall during the Great Recession, the seeds of which showed up in budgeting analyses as early as 2005.

“We were in a depression in Michigan, unlike anything the rest of the country was seeing,” former Republican House Majority Leader Mike Bishop recently told Michigan Advance.“If anybody wonders why there was so much venom and anxiety in Lansing during those times, that was the reason.”

Ultimately, the 2007 shutdown only lasted a few hours in the dark of night before a budget deal in the early morning.

In 2009, the budget battle again saw the era’s Democrats fighting for new revenue and the Republican zeal to balance the budget with cuts – similar to the actions being taken now by House Republicans in 2025.

With uncertainty about federal recovery dollars and lingering fatigue from 2007, the fight over revenue still loomed large in 2009, and the House, Senate and Granholm were again at odds. This time, Dillon agreed to some of the cuts Bishop proposed, putting him at odds with his own caucus and Granholm.

A budget deal wasn’t reached by the end of the fiscal year, a government shutdown began, but ended within hours after a continuation budget was passed.
Pennsylvania’s costly standoff
In Pennsylvania, the government won’t cease to function over a budget impasse.
But the nine-month standoff a decade ago prompted some counties and school districts – which get about one-third of their revenue from the state – to borrow money that’s still being paid back in some cases, with taxpayers covering the interest. 
“It’s a hidden tax,” said Bill Glasgall, public finance adviser at government-focused think tank the Volcker Alliance. 










If this is going to be a continuous feature of Pennsylvania politics, … and [counties] are left scrambling with some regularity, it's just not fair. It's not efficient. This isn't how it's supposed to work.


– Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.


As the current impasse dragged on through the summer, counties and human service providers were bracing for impacts. State payments had stopped for schools as well as county-run programs like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care and public health. Bipartisan House Bill 1609 would ensure payments for those critical needs continue; it’s been parked in the appropriations committee for months. 
Some programs serving the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians have cut pay and delayed spending on less urgent needs like conferences and tech upgrades. 
About one third of the state’s 67 counties already have dipped into savings to cover costs and a few are researching borrowing just in case the stalemate drags on, according to Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.
“If this is going to be a continuous feature of Pennsylvania politics, …  it’s just not fair,” Kopko said. “It’s not efficient. It’s not good at all. This isn’t how it’s supposed to work.” 
Senate Republicans advanced what they described as a stop-gap budget to mitigate the fallout alongside a transit funding proposal. But both measures quickly died in the Democrat-controlled House.  Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said his Republican colleagues lack urgency. 
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”
Stier, who once ran for a state House seat as a Democrat, predicts a resolution by mid-to-late September achieved by shifting money around so that the budget appears to be balanced – but isn’t really. 
“You can keep the budget artificially under $50 billion. But you’re in fact, going to be spending more later,” he said. 
Public finance experts advise against such one-time maneuvers. 
“People talk about kicking the can down the road. Really, it’s rolling a snowball,” said Noah Winn-Ritzenberg, Volcker’s senior director of public finance. “When you get there, the problem is just going to be larger.”
And it looks bad to lenders, potentially increasing borrowing costs, Glasgall noted. 
“Higher interest rates on debt – that’s effectively a tax on the citizens,” he said.
While Pennsylvania has improved its approach to budgeting and finance in recent years, Glasgall – like Stier – said the ongoing stalemate could prompt leaders to delay pension payments, artificially suppress estimated Medicaid costs (another sticking point in negotiations), delay infrastructure investment or resort to another such “gimmick” or a combination thereof. 
“If there were structural changes that could make people be honest about things like this,” Stier said, “I would be all in favor of it.”

Is there a better way to budget? 
Past years have seen more dramatic budget impasses than what’s transpired so far in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Glasgall noted. Illinois once operated for years without a budget. A New Jersey shutdown once infamously afforded then-Gov. Chris Christie an extremely private beach trip. Massachusetts hit its deadline this year after a 14-year late streak (to Pennsylvania’s 13 missed deadlines of the past 20). 

A couple of other states haven’t exactly finalized theirs for 2025-26. North Carolina adopted a mini-budget to keep the government running as deliberations continue. Oregon’s spending plan has come together in pieces to prevent a sticking point or two from delaying the entire thing.
Both strategies often emerge in conversations about structural change that happen when budgets are late.
Another is the automatic continuation resolution (a state defaults to operating according to its outgoing budget until electeds can agree on the next). Twenty states have this option, which has its critics. Public finance experts seem to agree that reducing pressure on budget negotiations doesn’t help them resolve faster. 
Stier pointed to the 2009 Pennsylvania court decision requiring state workers to be paid during an impasse as a structural change that has “made things worse.”
“It’s harder to get a budget done because there’s less pressure,” Stier said. 
A piecemeal budgeting approach like Oregon’s system affords flexibility, Glasgall noted. 
Stier said he doesn’t think that would work in Pennsylvania because it would advantage the GOP, because it delays tax and/or spending increases and so Democrats wouldn’t agree to the change. 
Structural changes also won’t negate political divisions nor the temptation to succumb to quick fixes when negotiations lock up. 
“As a political scientist, … we like to find that structure makes a huge difference. And sadly, the research over the last 30 or 40 years has not shown that’s the case,” Stier said. 
Partisanship also is contributing to both states’ budget delays, as is party infighting. Glasgall said others have endured budget stalemates when under single-party control, including in California, Kansas and New Jersey.

In Michigan, enduring the crisis of two shutdowns in close succession created political momentum for change.
The Citizens Research Council of Michigan made the case for an earlier budget timeline during the 2009 budget standoff, noting that the process itself might be to blame.
And John Nixon, the former budget director in Utah, was hired in late 2010 as director of the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget to help Michigan after the incoming Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, was elected that year.
Nixon was tasked with not just fixing the budget process, but with helping Snyder improve Michigan’s subpar financial standing in several areas. 
“It was trying to incorporate best practices and spending within our means,” Nixon said. “We’re feeding a bunch of local governments. We’re feeding school districts. How can they count on it?”
The solution from Snyder was to hold the Legislature to a loose June 30 deadline for talks to end and having a budget passed on July 1.
Despite some pushback, the move was embraced, Nixon said. The 2011 Legislature also saw Republicans back in control of the trifecta governor’s office, the House and the Senate. In 2019, the Legislature codified the deadline into statute, but with no real penalties for missing the mark.
Michigan’s Legislature has since missed that July 1 deadline on multiple occasions, but only by a few days or weeks, and the state never went down to the wire with its budget talks quite like it did in 2007 and 2009

Hall attempted to pass a resolution last month that would mean no pay for legislators if they blow the July 1 deadline. The measure ultimately failed. 
“Would that swing people?” Nixon said. “The thing you don’t want to do is you don’t want to pass a junk budget.”
Nixon noted that in Utah, a budget impasse led the state’s leaders to enact measures that obligated them to pass base budgets during the first week of session. That way, the government wouldn’t shut down in the event of a stalemate. 
He also said a solution would be needed to the current impasse and budget struggles in the years to come if Michigan gets a “double whammy” of a state shutdown and a potential federal shutdown – which appears more likely in the era of uncertainty during the  second Trump administration.
Winn-Ritzenberg says institutional values tend to be most influential, ultimately. 
“A lot of it really comes down more to culture within a state of either relying on budget maneuvers or a culture where [lawmakers] pass a clean budget and take pride in a professional approach in the budget office,” Winn-Ritzenberg said.

(University of Kentucky photo by Mark Cornelison )At a time when food insecurity has increased in the commonwealth, the University of Kentucky’s Big Blue Pantry is expanding services to meet students’ emergency food needs. 
Students can already go to the Big Blue Pantry, located in Frazee Hall’s Room 016, and get a bag of food items. But it’s open during work hours — not on weekends or holidays. 
Now, students can access emergency supplies after-hours with the installment of nine stocked food lockers in the basement of the William T. Young Library.

Andrew Perkins, the program coordinator for the Big Blue Pantry, said these new lockers “are a way for us to expand our reach, to help a student who is in a crisis situation or an emergency situation, to provide that bag of food outside of our regular open hours.” 
A student in need of food can apply online and will receive a unique code to one of the lockers, where they can go get a bag of food that should last two or three days. The bag has staple, nonperishable items like ramen noodles, macaroni and cheese, oatmeal, granola bars and canned goods. 
It’s not clear how many University of Kentucky students live with food insecurity. Across the state, nearly 17% of Kentuckians have a shortage of food, data shows. In the last academic year, the Big Blue Pantry served around 900 people over 2,500–3,000 visits to the pantry, Perkins said. 
“I think people can know anecdotally from their own experience at college that … sometimes going without, or  having to skip a meal every once in a while has been part of it, and it’s sometimes been considered a rite of passage,” Perkins said. “Well, we think differently about that today. We know that … if a student is worrying about where their next meal is coming from, or if they’re going to have the opportunity to eat today, then they’re not going to be as focused on their studies or their or their success in life in the bigger picture. Our mission is to remove that barrier, to remove the barrier of food insecurity, so a student can reach their ultimate potential.” 
The semester that just started is the first time the pantry is using the lockers, Perkins said, so staff need to study the needs and best ways to meet them. As of Sept. 5, two students had used the lockers. 
“A low number is fantastic — I’m glad we have them; I hope they never get used, Perkins said. “I hope that a student is never in that kind of situation, but if they are now, we have the ability to mitigate that situation.” 
According to Feeding America, hunger can worsen a person’s mental health, make it difficult to focus and lead to chronic health issues like heart disease and diabetes. 
Making sure students have enough food, Perkins said, is key to helping them be academically successful. 
“It is okay to need help,” he said, “and to ask for help as well.”

(Photo by Megan Schnabel)As an advocate for miners with black lung disease and their families, I was so disappointed to see a tax break for metallurgical coal in the Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. Why? Because that tax break will encourage the mining of coal that isn’t subject to the excise tax that supplements the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
Black lung disease is killing our communities. Miners are falling sick with the disease younger and younger. My husband has been battling black lung for 11 years, since he was 47 years old. I see what it does to him and to our family every day. Because of that, I deeply understand some of what the thousands of people in Appalachia who are impacted by black lung disease go through every day.
For nearly a decade I’ve poured my heart and soul into fighting for these men and their families and acting as a resource — whether they need help applying for benefits or a shoulder to cry on. As the vice president of the National Black Lung Association, I, along with other coal miner advocates, speak with congressional offices abbout the need to support mining families with a better black lung benefit system and the importance of preventing the disease among current and future coal miners once and for all. 
Something I have heard time and again when I push politicians to do better is, “but what about the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund? Isn’t it running out of money?” This often becomes a stopping point. We agree we’d like to work on ways to put more money into the fund in order to pay for stronger cost of living adjustments for mining families, but the conversations often end there.
The black lung trust fund, which kicks in to pay black lung benefits when a coal company can’t, is funded by an excise tax only on coal sold within the United States. The majority of met coal is exported overseas. Revenue from exported coal doesn’t go in to support the trust fund, but those miners are just as likely to get black lung as any other coal miner is. 
The least Congress could do is increase the monthly disability benefit that coal miners with black lung receive. It hasn’t kept up with inflation in decades. You can do the math yourself, or you can just ask any family that depends on the stipend as times get hard. 
So it felt like a slap in the face to give tax breaks to mining companies and not tie that tax break  to solving the problems faced by the miners that keep those companies afloat. But we can change that, and we know that Congress will listen to coal mining communities when we work together.
We recently had a victory when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut coal program staff at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The black lung associations, clinics and others worked together and told lawmakers that wasn’t right and it would hurt us. Many of those cuts were reversed. That shows me what’s possible when we’re united. Now coal communities need to band together again to ask our lawmakers to honor their commitment to coal miners who have and continue to help power this country with energy for homes and for our industries. We need to increase the black lung benefit levels while also making sure we protect miners from the silica dust that is making the black lung epidemic worse. 
If they want to give a tax break to met coal, that’s fine, but they better also find a way to stabilize the trust fund while also improving benefits for the mining families that depend on the stipend. Our miners deserve care and commitment to their health and future.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryAfter four years presiding over the state Senate, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is attempting to make the leap to the governor’s mansion this fall. She is running on a platform of conservative values and her campaign largely mirrors the themes that brought Gov. Glenn Youngkin victory in 2021 — parents’ rights, fiscal responsibility and defending personal freedoms. 
For most of the year she has trailed Democratic opponent Abigail Spanberger in fundraising and popularity, though the race appears to be tightening. According to an August Roanoke College poll, 39% of likely Virginia voters said they would choose Earle-Sears and 46% would pick Spanberger. In the spring, just 26% percent said they’d select Earle-Sears compared to Spanberger’s 43% of the vote. Earle-Sears’ campaign has raised over $11.5 million, according to her latest campaign finance filings, with $4.5 million in cash on hand. Spanberger has raised over $27 million and has more than $15 million in the pot. 
An immigrant from Jamaica whose background and policy positions are rooted in a firm Christian faith, Earle-Sears is a married mother of three (one of her daughters is deceased). She served in Virginia’s House of Delegates from 2002 to 2003.
Earle-Sears became the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia when she was elected lieutenant governor in 2021. If she ascends to the governorship, she will be the first Black woman in America to hold such a title. 
The Virginia Mercury reached out to both campaigns to learn more about their priorities and how they match up with Virginians’, and to find out how they plan to accomplish their legislative goals. Spanberger sat down with the Mercury’s team for an in-depth interview at her campaign office in Central Virginia. Earle-Sears agreed to an interview but canceled on the day of and has not responded to reschedule requests and other questions. Here’s a close look at her positions and promises, based on the Mercury’s previous reporting and that of other media outlets, as well as Earle-Sears’ public statements and actions in the Virginia General Assembly.
 Energy and environment

Earle-Sears has stated in previous interviews that she supports an “all of the above” energy profile for the state including nonrenewables like coal and gas. 
To combat the growing demand for more energy production in the state, Earle-Sears has publicly stated her support for “all of the above” energy profile for the state. That includes coal, gas, and nuclear energy, as well as renewable sources. She has not explicitly said whether she would repeal the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which mandates the transition to renewable energy production completely for utilities by 2050, but she has disparaged it and her approach to energy needs would be in conflict with the law.
“We will use clean coal, oil, renewables, nuclear, natural gas,” Earle-Sears said in an interview with Newsmax. “That’s a national security issue. The rogue nations of this world are not just going to do solar, and they’re not just going to do wind.”
In an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Examiner, Sears called the VCEA a “disastrous law”. 
Earle-Sears has also been supportive of the state’s removal from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Sears stated on social media last year that she supported Youngkin’s executive order to remove Virginia from the agreement, calling it an unnecessary tax on residents.
“The RGGI’s energy tax also made it impossible for Virginia’s natural gas plants to compete with producers in states without an energy tax,” Sears said in her op-ed. “As a result, electric generation in the Commonwealth decreased by 9% in 2021. If Spanberger brings back the energy tax, Virginia could face billions of dollars in economic costs.” 
 Health care

Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, setting the stage for major changes to Medicaid and hospital funding mechanisms. As governor, Spanberger or Earle-Sears could sign off on future state budgets and legislation to address the impact to Virginia residents’ health care. 
As thousands of Virginians could lose their Medicaid coverage, hospitals are also bracing for absorbing higher costs before being faced with cutting services, closing, or negotiating higher rates with private insurers. 
Earle-Sears previously told Newsmax that the reconciliation “bill does so many great things.” 
Meanwhile, Congress has until the end of the year to decide whether to renew expiring tax credits that help people without employer-provided health insurance purchase plans. Aetna has already announced it is leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace by the end of the year. The reduction of credits could further increase the number of uninsured people and their potential for reliance on free clinics, federally-qualified health centers and hospitals. 
In audio obtained by Cardinal News, Earle-Sears signaled interest in tapping into Virginia’s “rainy day fund,” a reserve meant for short term use, to shore up dwindling Medicaid funding. She would have to work with state lawmakers to do so; several of them who sit on financial committees told Cardinal they would support Earle-Sears’ idea but cautioned against over-utilizing in the long-term. 
 Immigration

Earle-Sears has spoken sparingly about immigration during her time in office, but when she does, her message has been clear: Virginia must strictly enforce immigration laws and partner closely with federal authorities.
When Youngkin announced Executive Order 47 in February — directing state police and local law enforcement to assist federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in removing undocumented immigrants accused of violent crimes — Earle-Sears linked the policy to her own journey as a legal immigrant.
“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the Governor, Attorney General, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said at the time. “We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this Executive Order will make sure we send them back to where they came from.”
The order also coincided with Youngkin’s creation of a Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, designed to boost cooperation between state agencies, local police and federal partners, including ICE. It has drawn strong criticism from Democrats — including Earle-Sears’ opponent, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger — who argue the directive undermines community trust in law enforcement and inflates claims of criminal activity tied to immigration. 
Youngkin has defended the measure, pointing to high-profile ICE courthouse raids and a “gang and immigration sweep” that his administration said led to more than 2,500 arrests of “violent criminals” who were in the country illegally.
Earle-Sears has framed the debate through a personal lens. 
In unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal late last year, she recalled the paperwork her family filed to immigrate legally. 
“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States,” she said. “Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state. … The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America.”
While Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares have been more vocal in defending the state’s immigration crackdown, Earle-Sears’ remarks underscore her alignment with the administration’s hard-line approach and her willingness to root that position in her own experience.

 Public education

Recently, Earle-Sears shared her views on gender policies in Virginia schools when, at an August 21 school board meeting, she  spoke against Arlington Public Schools’ transgender bathroom policy that allows students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
“What is happening in our schools right now is just, it’s dangerous, it’s insane and it has to stop,” Sears said. “Here’s the truth. There are two sexes, boys and girls, and for generations, we’ve understood this — that they deserve their own sports teams, their own locker rooms, their own bathrooms.”
During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Sears has been vocal about her support of enforcing gender-segregated policies much like the Youngkin administration, which overhauled policies to require students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their sex assigned at birth.
Conservatives argue that having students use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their sex at birth protects other students and preserves moral and religious foundations.
The Mercury contacted Earle-Sears’ campaign to learn more about her history on gender policies, considering she has served on the state’s Board of Education, even as vice president, and did not raise these concerns about gender issues in public education during her tenure. She did not respond.
Earle-Sears has taken stands to overturn Virginia’s ban on conversion therapy, which is a practice that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity that the American Psychological Association said is not rooted in science and can be harmful.
She also supported other schooling options including proposals that would allow low-income parents to use the state portion of per-pupil funding for tuition at private schools or for other education expenses.
 Reproductive rights

Earle-Sears has made her stance against abortion clear during and before her gubernatorial campaign’s launch. 
She served as a keynote speaker at this year’s March for Life anti-abortion rally in Richmond, asking the crowd of about 2,000 attendees, “We stand for life and how can it ever be wrong to stand for life?”
During Virginia’s General Assembly session this year, Earle-Sears expressed opposition to Virginia’s in-progress effort to enshrine reproductive rights including abortion into the constitution, but has not answered follow-up questions on whether she would support the measure if its language were adjusted. 
When signing the advanced legislation earlier this year, her duty as lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears wrote that she was “morally opposed to this bill; no protections for the child.” 
During her 2021 lieutenant governor campaignshe described abortions at “genocide” and noted threat to the life of the parent-to-be as the only exception she believed the procedure should have. But closer to Election Day that year, she scrubbed anti-abortion language from her campaign website. 
Republican-led abortion restrictions or near-total bans that have been proposed in the legislature did not advance far enough for her to weigh in with a tie-breaking vote.  She did cast such a vote on a right-to-contraception bill, voting against it. 
 Elections and voting 

Earle-Sears has consistently framed election integrity as central to her public message, emphasizing that only U.S. citizens should have access to the ballot while largely avoiding debate on restoring voting rights for felons who have completed their sentences.
After the U.S. Supreme Court issued an emergency stay last October allowing Virginia to continue removing thousands of people from its voter rolls under Youngkin’s order, Earle-Sears praised the decision as a victory for fairness.
“As an immigrant and a naturalized citizen of our great country, I am personally grateful for this decision that upholds the rule of law,” she said in a statement. “Voting is one of the most fundamental rights we have as Americans and this decision is essential in protecting the rights of naturalized citizens and all Americans.”
She also thanked Attorney General Jason Miyares for defending the policy in court, saying Virginians could cast ballots “with ease” and have “complete confidence our elections are free from politically-motivated interference.” 
Democrats criticized the order as a voter purge, while Republicans cast it as enforcing laws already on the books.
Earle-Sears has used her platform to remind Virginians that state law has long required removal of non-citizens from voter rolls. In a Facebook post in October, she highlighted that in 2006 then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, signed legislation to that effect. 
“It was the law then and it REMAINS the law now,” she wrote, presenting the statute as a guardrail against fraud.
Her rhetoric on elections has also touched on the political fallout from President Donald Trump’s efforts to challenge the 2020 results. 
Following the 2022 midterms, she told the Associated Press that Republicans received “a very clear message” from voters and that “it is time to move on” from Trump. While not outlining specific reforms, the remarks placed her among GOP officials urging the party to look ahead rather than dwell on Trump’s grievance.
On one of the most contentious state debates — whether to automatically restore voting rights for felons who have served their time — Earle-Sears has remained mostly silent. 
Youngkin ended his predecessors’ automatic restoration policy in favor of case-by-case review, leaving thousands uncertain about their eligibility. Earle-Sears has not publicly commented on the shift, even as civil rights advocates and Democrats push a constitutional amendment to guarantee automatic restoration.
 Housing policy 

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates there’s a shortage of about 4.5 million homes in America, nearly a third of Virginia households spend over 30% of their income on housing costs, and there’s a severe lack of affordable housing options statewide, state studies found. Housing policies would have been a focal point of The Mercury’s planned August interview with Earle-Sears because it’s not a subject she has addressed specifically on the campaign trail. 
She has, however, spoken broadly about goals to address the cost of living. To help with this, Earle-Sears plans to push to eliminate the state’s car tax — a long-simmering proposal politicians in both parties have explored but have yet to fully achieve. 
Earle-Sears’ campaign website also states that she “will scour the government books to cut wasteful government spending and job-killing regulations because taxpayers know how to spend their money and run their businesses better than (the) government.”
While none of these policies tie directly to housing, in theory money constituents save elsewhere could decrease housing affordability burdens. 
 Criminal justice and policing

At an August campaign event in Chesterfield County, Earle-Sears reiterated her commitment to supporting law enforcement officials. 
“I believe in ‘backing the blue,’ I believe in honoring our law enforcement,” she said.  
Earle-Sears added that she planned to support legislation that would prevent the first $20,000 of law enforcement officers’ salaries from being taxed by the state. 
“We need them and we don’t have enough of them,” she said. 
She also supports Trump’s ramp up of deportations for undocumented immigrants. Her campaign website mentions opposing “radical policies like catch and release.” 
On the flip side, she signaled a warm response to a bipartisan probation reform bill that passed this year, designed to help former prisoners shorten their probation times by achieving different rehabilitative milestones. 
Though she declined to comment further on the measure when asked by The Mercury at the time, during a Feb. 12 segment of conservative radio program The John Fredericks Show, Earle-Sears said that the state should “do as much as possible to ensure we don’t spend money twice” — a reference to housing people in prisons and jails or processing them through the court systems when they reoffend. 
She discussed broader access to educational and vocational opportunities for incarcerated individuals, aiming to help with employment and housing once their sentences are completed. 
“If we can give them incentives then we can get them engaged, get them an education. … Then if you have a job, of course there’s something about work that dignifies the soul,” Earle-Sears said. “I’m all for lifting up that soul.”
Her background providing Christian ministry in prisons likely informs her views on second chances. 
The second part of the Mercury’s On the Record series, featuring Democratic governor nominee Abigail Spanberger, will be published Tuesday, September 9. Read more of our Election 2025 coverage here.

Trump dances after addressing U.S. forces, coalition partners and Qatari citizens at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, on May 15, 2025. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Sean Moriarty)The words of the Preamble to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Constitution are inscribed above a hallway door at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport: “Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be erected.” 
The Trump administration certainly validates the first part of that maxim, but increasingly shows no interest in the second part.
President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order aiming to change the name of the Department of Defense back to the Department of War. That was what the cabinet agency overseeing the nation’s military forces was called from its creation by Congress in 1789 until 1949. The name change reflected the merging of the Navy, Army and Air Force as a single organization led by a civilian secretary. 
Trump’s move screams of chest-thumping bravado, likely in large part in response to the recent ca -rides, shared laughter and hand-holding events well-covered by the media between “bros” Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. What we are witnessing is an ego-driven display of male “mine-is-bigger-than-yours” on an international scale that will not bode well for people trying to live their lives and make ends meet under these autocratic rulers. 
All leaders have egos, but when egos go into hyperdrive and are linked to national security, it does not bode well. Lyndon Johnson’s tragic mishandling of Vietnam was in large part due to personalizing the war, seeing the troops as “my boys,” and Ho Chi Minh as “his enemy,” thereby making “losing” a threat to his ego.
Conventional wisdom posits that “fight or flight” is the human response to threat. Actually, however, those two options are more prevalent among men — and the UNESCO adage specifically references men. Women favor what is known as “tend and befriend” options, where they seek to deescalate conflicts and build defenses with allies. “Flight” is often associated with cowardice, and hence unacceptable if ego is driving decisions. Strong leaders not led by ego have long recognized the value of using all options — fight, flight, tend and befriend — and using them prudently. 










All leaders have egos, but when egos go into hyper-drive and are linked to national security, it does not bode well.


The idea that a best offense is a good defense dates back to George Washington, who considered “prudence” — which differentiates sound strategy from ego-driven, shoot-from-the hip aggression — a key attribute of his leadership. Defense is the cornerstone of deterrence, a strategy that has long served the United States well. And as my son’s baseball coach used to point out: “if they don’t score, you can’t lose.”
Renaming  the Defense Department would allow Trump to create conditions for a self-fulfilling prophecy, and those rarely go well for politicians who initiate them. Unfortunately, trying to stop the ill-advised instincts of politicians can be difficult for individuals around them. The head of Central Command, Adm. William “Fox” Fallon, found himself embroiled in a scandal that led to his resignation after Esquire magazine ran an article in 2008 titled “The Man Between War and Peace.” Fallon was quoted in the article as having said that the George W. Bush administration’s aggressive rhetoric toward Iran – “a constant drumbeat of conflict” was not useful. 
Even acolytes must be careful not to rile the wrath of sensitive ego-driven leaders or risk retribution. Witness the long list of former Trump friends, staff members, friends and even political allies denounced when they seemingly failed ego-driven loyalty tests.
Officially changing the name of the Defense Department would require congressional action. Republicans U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Greg Steube of Florida filed legislation calling for such a rebrand in their respective chambers. But the second Trump administration has already proven masterful at work-arounds, loopholes and simply ignoring U.S. law. Wanting this name change, however, communicates a signal of U.S. intentions that will almost certainly push panic buttons among U.S. allies regarding the logic and stability of U.S. leadership and policy, and push adversaries closer together, neither of which will be good for the country.
I was recently reminded of a Turkish proverb that well describes the “normalized insanity” environment in which we currently live. “Though the forest thinned, the people continued to vote for the ax. The ax told them that because his handle was wood, he was one of them, and they believed him.” The people of Russia and China have lived under autocratic rule for so long their voices are largely muted. 
National security should not be a partisan issue. In the United States there is still time to stop what could otherwise become a runaway train toward not just autocratic rule, but international conflict, if enough people say “enough.”

Tucker High School in Henrico County on June 16, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger told the Mercury in a recent interview that “nothing is off the table” when it comes to reconciling the differences among federal and state leaders over higher education issues that have boiled over in Virginia this year.
Spanberger’s response comes as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to target colleges and universities in Virginia and across the nation for DEI practices, alleging that the institutions are hiring instructors based on race or gender and discriminating against certain students, which the schools have refuted. George Mason University is facing four federal investigations. The University of Virginia has also come under federal scrutiny for allegedly failing to fully dismantle its DEI program. 
Democratic leaders in the Virginia Senate have rejected 22 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments to university governing boards, prompted by the lawmakers’ “genuine concerns about the qualifications, backgrounds, and intentions” of the appointees, Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, wrote in a letter to Youngkin.
Senate committee Democrats block 14 more Youngkin appointees from Va. college boards

The governor’s office, in turn, criticized the lawmakers, writing that they have “consistently caused harm to the governance and operation of our colleges and universities.” The governor’s administration has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court to lift a temporary suspension on the appointments for three governing boards at Virginia’s higher education institutions brought forward by Senate Democrats.
Spanberger said she would support efforts to allow universities to hire their own counsel, approved by university boards. She also said she would support a confirmation process that is “truly confirmatory” compared to the current delayed process that, by practice, has allowed appointments to begin serving immediately, before confirmation by the full General Assembly during its session. She said she would also support efforts to have appointments start at the beginning of the year and emphasized the need for clear appointee removal standards.
On August 12, Spanberger announced some of her ideas for higher education as part of her overall “Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan,” which includes making college more affordable and accessible, as well as increasing college coursework for high school students.
“I still have the benefit of many months to continue looking at the way that some of the board members are handling themselves,” Spanberger said in the interview “but certainly nothing is off the table in terms of the steps that I would take to frankly, strengthen what is clearly a weak system where universities here in Virginia can become this punching bag (to) the detriment of students and professors in the larger university community, but most importantly, the students.”
The campaign office for Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee, did not respond to questions about her higher education stance and has not published any plans about it. She has expressed support for laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools, that are created and operated in partnership with colleges and universities. 
Early voting for governor and other statewide seats will begin on Sept. 19.

Gary Click is joining the chorus of Ohio officials floating ideas to rein in property taxes.
The Vickery Republican recently introduced a “trilogy” of property tax reforms restricting what levies are available, potentially requiring more of them to go to the voters and imposing higher thresholds to pass more expensive levies.
“I know that our constituents are demanding a response, and this is me saying, ‘I’m listening,’” Click said.
His ideas join several others up for debate. A handful of proposals would cap the growth in property taxes — either to a specific percentage, the rate of inflation or based on a homeowner’s wealth. Others would expand the homestead exemption.
After vetoing several property tax measures in the state budget, Gov. Mike DeWine put together a new working group to come up with suggestions as well. The group continues to meet and is tasked with sharing their ideas at the end of the month.

Click’s trio
The first bill Click filed, House Bill 420, would eliminate continuing levies. In short, every property tax proposal on the ballot after 2030 would need to have an end date.
“We’re not saying that these are bad levies that are out there,” Click said. “But it’s saying, okay, each generation should have a voice in saying ‘I understand what I’m paying this tax for, I agree, or I disagree.’ I think that’s too much, or not enough, or whatever it is, but that each generation gets to have their voice heard.”

Continuing levies filed prior to that cutoff would expire unless they were approved to pay for bonds. Any taxes that did expire as a result of the bill would be eligible for renewal, but taxing authorities would have to take the proposal to the ballot.
Click’s second measure allows local organizers to reduce what’s known as “inside millage.” The Ohio Constitution allows local authorities to levy up to 10 mills (or 1%) in property taxes without going to the voters. Anything beyond that amount requires voter approval. House Bill 421 would allow petitioners to go to the ballot to lower that 10-mill ceiling further.
Organizers would need to gather signatures from 15% of the area’s voters in the most recent gubernatorial election to get the question on the ballot. The bill also requires two-thirds approval from local taxing authorities to put the question of restoring the 10-mill ceiling on the ballot.
“What works in Sandusky County might not work in Seneca County; what works in Seneca County might not work in Crawford County or Marion County,” Click argued. “And so each county gets to assess and look at the situation, and what works for their community, rather than imposing a statewide assessment on property.”
His last proposal, House Bill 422, would require supermajority support for proposals with higher millage rates. Levies of less than one mill (or 0.1%) could pass with a simple majority, but those of one mill to 1.9 mills would need at least 60% approval and those of two mills or more would have to clear 66%.
“The more you want, the more you ask for, the higher the bar is going to be,” Click said.
His second and third proposals, however, could test the boundaries within the state constitution. The Ohio Constitution sets the terms, barring local authorities from taxing property “in excess of one per cent of its true value” unless those levies are “approved by at least a majority of the electors.”
Whether courts would interpret that section as guaranteeing 10 mills of unvoted property tax or a simple majority standard for additional levies is an open question. So far, Click said, he hasn’t heard any warning about constitutional conflicts.
Working group check in
The governor’s working group continues to wrestle with recommendations for lawmakers. At its most recent hearing, the group debated a pair of delay tactics.
First, the working group considered offering some kind of deferral for homeowners hit with eye-popping property tax bills. But even that simple idea raises a host of other questions. Should it be one-time or renewable? Should the state charge interest? What about minimum requirements — do homeowners need a certain amount of equity or ownership history?
The group largely settled on capping deferrals at a dollar amount whether they run once or consecutively. It also nixed the idea of charging interest, while leaving the door open for charging an administrative fee. In terms of minimum requirements, a home equity benchmark was popular, but Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan explained it would be difficult to assess.
“You know, I can pull your mortgage to see what you took a mortgage out for,” he said, “but I can’t see how much you’ve paid down on that or not, and are there other outstanding liens that aren’t recorded?”
Instead, the group landed on a 10-year home ownership minimum as a decent proxy. The members also seemed open to making ownership transferrable, so seniors who downsize don’t wind up resetting the clock.
But not everyone was on board with deferrals. Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway likened pushing off payment amounts to kicking the can down the road.
“It doesn’t change what somebody’s tax liability is,” Galloway said. “All we’re doing is changing the taking — collecting those taxes from grandma or her corpse, right?”
Instead, Galloway suggested lawmakers pause property tax increases temporarily while they come up with a comprehensive response.
“The idea behind it is to, like, hit the pause button somehow,” he said. “To stop the outrage, to stop the bleeding, to be able to say, let’s give ourselves some time to fix this problem right.”
Auditors would still go forward with assessing properties and updating valuations, but tax bills would hold steady. That delay might give lawmakers time to pass legislation like House Bill 186 — an idea popular with working group members that would limit tax increases to the rate of inflation.
But other working group members, particularly Chair Bill Seitz, seemed skeptical of the idea. Those paused tax increases would eventually come due, and in the meantime, the benefits would land unevenly. For instance, Galloway acknowledged taxpayers who saw spikes after last year’s reassessments, including those in his county, wouldn’t get any immediate relief.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Over the course of a summer as hot and dry as this one, without intervention, New Hampshire’s apple crop might drop right off their branches before eager apple pickers could reach them.
But as summer turns to fall and drought conditions wear on across much of the state, New Hampshire farmers aren’t letting their crops wilt. Instead, in the face of increasingly extreme weather fluctuations, some farmers are turning to new technologies and data-driven approaches they hope will keep them productive and competitive despite New Hampshire’s changing climate.
“We’re definitely taking steps to minimize the impact of weather events, including drought. We’re seeing all sorts of changes on farms, and proactive approaches to that,” said Jeremy Delisle, fruit and vegetable production field specialist with UNH Extension in Merrimack County.
The changing climate in New Hampshire, and the Northeast, is characterized by greater rainfall overall — but that rain falls unevenly throughout the year, said New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone. That, coupled with increasingly warm summers, can quickly lead to drought conditions like those the state is experiencing this summer, she said. 
As of Sept. 5, more than 91% of New Hampshire was experiencing some degree of drought, with about 46% of the state under severe drought conditions, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The droughts are happening. They’re going to happen. They have for a long time, but it’s the intensity, it’s how dry we get that we can attribute to climate change,” Stampone said.

The pendulum swing pattern from heavy rainfall in late winter and springtime to dry summers can be hard for farmers, said Zoe Hardy, an apple grower at Brookdale Fruit Farm in Hollis and a member of the New Hampshire Fruit Growers Association.
“It seems to be feast or famine — we’re either flooded or dry,” she said.
To handle this shift, farmers are employing a suite of evolving practices to keep crops coming. And much of this, said Delisle and UNH Extension Soil Health State Specialist Renuka Mathur, comes down to soil management.
In the field, Delisle and Mathur said they have increasingly observed farmers adopting soil management practices designed to make their crops more drought-resistant.
The most ubiquitous among these is targeted, or drip, irrigation, which uses lines to deliver water directly to the cultivated crop.
“Irrigation is an insurance policy,” Hardy said. “If you didn’t (irrigate), you’d lose your crop.”

Drip irrigation is more water-efficient and precise than other traditional forms of irrigation, like overhead sprinklers, that deliver water to places it isn’t needed — like the empty spaces between rows of crops, Delisle said. This efficiency boost, he said, may be what’s driving the increasing use of drip irrigation on New Hampshire farms, which vary widely in their access to water, especially in times of drought.
“Every drop counts,” he said.
To take their efficiency even further, Delisle said, a growing number of farms have deployed soil moisture sensors — electronic devices buried in fields that provide real-time information about soil moisture content. Some broadcast this information right to farmers’ phones, allowing growers to add just the right amount of water to their fields for plant health.
And broader applications of real-time data help farmers, too, like an Extension computer model that can estimate how much water a particular field of apple trees is pulling from the soil on a given day. Fed on data from a network of weather stations across the state, the model is intended to help farmers focus their water use even further, Delisle said.
“It really is the age of information and data to help make those decisions,” he said.
Some more analog farming techniques are also crucial for drought resilience, Mathur said. A foundational element of soil health is related to how much organic material it contains, a measure boosted by additives like compost, manure, or cover crops. In addition to adding nutrients to the soil, these materials also cling to water, helping keep soil damp and cool in times of limited rainfall, she said.
Once organic materials are present in the soil, they can be retained for longer with methods like no-till farming or reduced-till farming, in which farmers refrain as much as possible from plowing their fields. Chewing up a field before planting a crop adds air to the soil, fueling the decomposition of the important organic matter within, Delisle said. While no-till and reduced-till farming isn’t a good fit for every crop, he added, many New Hampshire farmers have had success using the method with the common local crops of corn and pumpkins.
Preserving the organic matter in New Hampshire’s soil is important not only in times of drought but also, Delisle said, in times of heavy rain and flooding, when farm equipment can compress fields. This compacts the soil and makes it less hospitable to plants.
“Soils with higher organic matter in them have the capacity to spring back once they’re pressed down, and that’s an important factor in the resiliency of that soil,” Delisle said.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Beyond soil management techniques, New Hampshire farmers’ adaptations to changing weather patterns are evident in shifting crop stocks, he added. In the specific case of fruit trees, this may involve swapping out rootstocks, the hardy lower portion of a tree onto which farmers graft fruit-producing branches.
Instead of common “dwarf” rootstocks, which keep trees small and compact, more New Hampshire farmers are opting for slightly larger varieties, said Delisle. These stocks grow deeper root networks that allow them to tap into water deep underground in times of drought. But they are also unwieldy, harder to prune and harvest than trees grown on dwarf rootstocks, and can take years longer to begin producing fruit.
While a combination of these adaptations can allow farmers to successfully navigate the challenges of extreme weather, evolving does come at a cost.
This summer, at Brookdale, drought conditions have required near-constant irrigation, including the efforts of three to four farm employees at a time who must drive around watching for leaks and checking valves, Hardy said.
“We’ve been irrigating pretty much around the clock. It definitely is making it more challenging, but it shouldn’t impact our harvest,” she said. “…It just takes a lot more of our time. It’s just one more thing that we need to really manage.”
But the commitment, Hardy said, is essential. In a week without rain, Brookdale’s irrigation system draws from 11 irrigation ponds, two wells, and — at one optimally placed field — the Nashua River to deliver about 9,000 gallons of water to each acre of apple trees. Without this, Hardy said, the fruit might not reach its target size — or, worse, the stems could dry up, causing the apples to fall off the trees before they can be harvested.
This year, according to Hardy, it looks like Brookdale has just enough water available to scrape by with a successful harvest. Even so, as of Sept. 4, some of the farm’s irrigation ponds had run too low to use. The farming team decided to cut off irrigation to some other crops earlier than they would have liked to direct more to their apples, the farm’s biggest crop, Hardy said.
“You have to prioritize when it’s this dry,” she said. “…Like anything with limited resources, you have to pick and choose.”
Despite their importance, some of the resilience methods described by Mathur and Delisle can also be costly to implement. This is particularly challenging for New Hampshire’s small farms; about 80% of farms in the state make less than $25,000 a year in sales, according to data from the UNH Extension.
“There are some farms that are marginal or subsistence levels, you can say — not everybody’s very productive,” Mathur said. “… Beginner farmers in the field … for less than five years won’t have that much capital to invest in these big structural modifications on their farms to overcome these climate problems.”
For some of these growers, a cost-sharing incentive program with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that provides sustainability support for farmers, has paved the way for broader adoption of resilience technologies, said Mathur and Delisle. But even with that help, the task of keeping farms productive in New Hampshire’s changing climate has not been easy.
“Those costs, growers have already laid out that money to implement all of this stuff so they can pull off these great crops for us,” Delisle said. “And so, as always, my message is, you know, now it’s our turn to get out there and support our local farms, because the crop is there and waiting for us.”

While peach trees are naturally delicate, drought conditions add to the possibility that the trees will break and be lost in this manner, said grower Zoe Hardy.

The drug helps reduce cravings for opioids and the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
While the nation as a whole has seen decreases in opioid overdose deaths in recent years, overdose deaths among Black, Latino and Indigenous people have continued to increase.
Many medical and health policy experts fear the broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed in July will worsen the problem by increasing the number of people without health insurance. As a result of the law, the number of people without coverage will increase by about 10 million by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
About 7.5 million of the people who will lose coverage under the new law are covered by Medicaid. Shortly before Trump signed the bill into law, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Boston University estimated that roughly 156,000 Medicaid recipients will lose access to medications for opioid addiction because of the cuts, resulting in approximately 1,000 more overdose deaths annually.
Because Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented on the rolls, the Medicaid cuts will have a disproportionate effect on communities that already face higher barriers to getting medications to treat addiction.
Overdose deaths are rising among Black and Indigenous Americans

From 2017 to 2023, the percentage of U.S. retail pharmacies regularly dispensing buprenorphine increased from 33% to 39%, according to a study published last week in Health Affairs.
But researchers found the drug was much less likely to be available in pharmacies in mostly Black (18% of pharmacies) and Hispanic neighborhoods (17%), compared with mostly white ones (46%).
In some states, the disparity was even worse. In California, for example, only about 9% of pharmacies in Black neighborhoods dispensed buprenorphine, compared with 52% in white neighborhoods.
The researchers found buprenorphine was least available in Black and Latino neighborhoods across nearly all states.
Barriers to treatment
Dr. Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr, a family physician who specializes in addiction medicine, said many communities of color are “pharmacy deserts.” Even the pharmacies that do exist in those neighborhoods tend to “have additional barriers to obtain buprenorphine and other controlled substances out of a concern for historic overuse of some treatments,” said Trotzky-Sirr, who wasn’t involved in the study.
In addition to its federal classification as a controlled substance, buprenorphine is also subject to state regulations to prevent illegal use. Pharmacies that carry it know that wholesalers and distributors audit their orders, which dissuades some from stocking or dispensing it.
Dima Qato, associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California and an author of the Health Affairs study, said that without changes in policy, Black and Hispanic people will continue to have an especially hard time getting buprenorphine.
“If you don’t address these dispensing regulations, or regulate buprenorphine from the aspect of pharmacy regulations, people are still going to encounter barriers accessing it,” she said.


Medicaid covers 47% of nonelderly adults who suffer from opioid use disorder.


In neighborhoods where at least a fifth of the population is on Medicaid, just 35% of pharmacies dispensed buprenorphine, Qato and her team found. But in neighborhoods with fewer residents on Medicaid, about 42% of pharmacies carried the drug.
Medicaid covers nearly half — 47% — of nonelderly adults who suffer from opioid use disorder. In states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, another recent study found an increase in people getting prescriptions for buprenorphine.
“Medicaid is the backbone of care for people struggling with opioid use disorder,” said Cherlette McCullough, a Florida-based mental health therapist. “We’re going to see people in relapse. We’re going to see more overdoses. We’re going to see more people in the ER.”
Qato said the shortage of pharmacies in minority communities is likely to get worse, as many independent pharmacists are already struggling to stay open.
“We know they’re more likely to close in neighborhoods of color, so there’s going to be even fewer pharmacies that carry it in the neighborhoods that really need it,” she said.
‘There needs to be urgency’
Qato and her colleagues say states and local governments should mandate that pharmacies carry a minimum stock of buprenorphine and dispense it to anyone coming in with a legitimate prescription. As examples, they point to a Philadelphia ordinance mandating that pharmacies carry the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone and similar emergency contraception requirements in Massachusetts.
“We need to create expectations. We need to encourage our pharmacies to carry this to make it accessible, same day, and there needs to be urgency,” said Arianna Campbell, a physician assistant and co-founder of the Bridge Center, a California-based organization that aims to help increase addiction treatment in emergency rooms.
“In many of the conversations I have with pharmacies, when I’m getting some pushback, I have to say: ‘Hey, this person’s at the highest risk of dying right now. They need this medication right now.’”
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

She said patients frequently become discouraged due to barriers they face in getting prescriptions filled. The Bridge Center has been expanding its patient navigator program across the state, and helping other states start their own. The program helps patients identify pharmacies where they can fill their prescription fastest.
“There’s a medication that can help you, but at every turn it’s really hard to get it,” she said, calling the disparities in access to medication treatment “unacceptable.”
Trotzky-Sirr, the California doctor, fears the looming Medicaid cuts will cause many of her patients to discontinue treatment and relapse. Many of her patients are covered by Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program.
“A lot of our patients are able to obtain medications for treatment of addiction like buprenorphine, because of the state covering the cost of the medication,” said Trotzky-Sirr, who also is a regional coordinator at the Bridge Center.
“They don’t have the resources to pay for it, cash, out of pocket.”
Some low-income patients switch between multiple providers or clinics as they try to find care and coverage, she added. These could be interpreted as red flags to a pharmacy.
Trotzky-Sirr argued buprenorphine does not need to be monitored as carefully as opioids and other drugs that are easier to misuse or overuse.
“Buprenorphine does not have those features and really needs to be in a class by itself,” she said. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to explain that to a pharmacist in 30 seconds over the phone.”
New studies find wide racial disparities in opioid overdose treatment

More is known about the medication now than when it was placed on the controlled substances list about two decades ago, said Brendan Saloner, a Bloomberg Professor of American Health in Addiction and Overdose at Johns Hopkins University.
Pharmacies are fearful of regulatory scrutiny and don’t have “countervailing pressure” to ensure patients get the treatments, he said.
On top of that fear, Medicaid managed care plans’ prior authorization processes may also be adding to the pharmacy bottleneck, he said.
“Black and Latino communities have higher rates of Medicaid enrollment, so to the extent that Medicaid prior authorization techniques are a hassle to pharmacies, that may also kind of discourage them [pharmacies] from stocking buprenorphine,” he said.
In some states, buprenorphine is much more readily available. In Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont, more than 70% of pharmacies carried the drug, according to the study. Buprenorphine availability was highest in states such as Oregon that have the least restrictive regulations for dispensing it.
In contrast, less than a quarter of pharmacies in Iowa, North Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., carried the medication.
“We’re going to see more people becoming unhoused, because without treatment, they’re going to go back to those old habits,” McCullough, the Florida therapist, said. “When we talk about marginalized communities, these are the populations that are going to suffer the most because they already have challenges with access to care.”

The Arkansas Department of Human Services terminated its contract with Chicago-based RedMane Technology last September after the contractor did not deliver the product the state wanted, according to documents obtained via the state Freedom of Information Act.
RedMane Technology inked a $44 million deal with Kansas in July for a similar project.
Emails and reports obtained from DHS document RedMane’s lack of progress on the project and state officials’ subsequent frustration over the course of two years.
DHS and RedMane “mutually agreed to end the project” in August 2024, agency spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said that month in response to media inquiries.
“The project ended because a viable product was not developed within the contractually agreed time, scope, and budget parameters,” according to the project’s final progress report issued last September.
Since 1997, Arkansas has kept records of child maltreatment reports and cases using the Children’s Reporting and Information System (CHRIS). The Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline, which is part of the system, received 8,154 reports between Jan. 1 and March 31 of this year, DHS reported to lawmakers in May.
The state sought to update CHRIS, a federally recognized Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System, because of financial incentives under a 2016 federal rule that gives states “a more favorable cost allocation” if they switch to a Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System.











There is a continuing disconnect between the State’s expectations and RedMane’s system configurations.


– Maximus Human Services' March 2023 report on the ARfocus project



DHS’ Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) tasked RedMane with creating this new system, called ARfocus, starting March 1, 2022, according to the original contract. The contract set a maximum cost of $10.9 million for the first year of what was expected to be a seven-year, $26.2 million project.
The contract was amended four times, with the final one signed in November 2023. At that time, the agreement projected $14.3 million through February 2025 and $26.7 million through February 2029.
The state paid $12.2 million to RedMane between April 2022 and January of this year, according to invoices the Advocate obtained via FOIA.
CHRIS is “fully capable of meeting all our needs at this time,” but a new system “built on modern cloud-based software that uses a mobile-friendly application” would be more efficient, Lesnick told the Advocate.
“It’s less about the current system not working and more about the need to support future upgrades and compatibility,” he said.
 ‘This just isn’t acceptable’

RedMane was supposed to build the ARfocus database on a “modern and mobile-friendly case management system [that] will allow users to work and collaborate in ways the previous system simply could not,” according to an April 2022 news release from RedMane announcing the project. The news release noted that RedMane was opening a Little Rock office.

AR DHS Significant Concerns 
“Implementing this system will be transformative to how DCFS staff engage and support the children, families, and caregivers we serve,” then-DCFS Director Mischa Martin said at the time.
Nearly a year and a half later, Martin emailed RedMane with “significant concerns” about the functionality of ARfocus and RedMane’s capacity to fix things.
The Arkansas State Police’s Child Abuse Hotline staff had been “consistently reporting about the system slowness” since ARfocus launched on May 30, 2023, Martin told RedMane staff in her Sept. 11, 2023 email.
Hotline administrator Dan Mack said in an August 2023 email to DHS staff that ARfocus was “creeping along.”
“We’re getting killed every day at the same time and it’s taking us hours to recover,” Mack said. “This just isn’t acceptable.”
RedMane staff attributed the “slowness” to “an ASP infrastructure issue” in an email to DCFS earlier that month.
Other issues included failed mandated reporter portals and “stalled servers that appear to have not been monitored,” Martin wrote. RedMane had not resolved the issues “despite the daily stand-up calls and deployment efforts,” she added.
“Even if these issues are fixed and resolved, we are concerned about the product quality and the impact for the next major phase [of implementation],” Martin wrote. “This would be a project failure if we had rolled out the entire system to statewide field staff and stakeholders. Our organization values the partnership we have had with RedMane, but the ongoing problems have eroded our confidence in your ability to deliver reliable and high-quality code.”
Martin left DHS in October 2023 and is now running for state Senate. She declined an interview for this article.
RedMane did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment.

 More frustrations

Virginia-based Maximus Human Services monitored and assessed RedMane’s performance on the development of ARfocus throughout the project. As of February 2025, DHS had paid Maximus more than $6 million over five years.
Maximus’ monthly reports on ARfocus, starting in October 2022 and ending in August 2024, detailed the fraught working relationship between RedMane and DCFS.
A seven-week delay of the first phase of the ARfocus rollout cost the state $158,000, Maximus reported in March 2023.
“And even with this extra time, there is a continuing disconnect between the State’s expectations and RedMane’s system configurations,” the report states.
By June 2024, ARfocus had “by far exceeded the cost we anticipated and is now totalling about 400% of what we had projected,” RedMane principal Colin Michaelis wrote in an email to DCFS staff. “This has left RedMane in an untenable fiscal position.”
Michaelis suggested making several changes to the project, including “for the state to share the fiscal burden for completing the implementation of ARFocus on a 50/50 basis for the work remaining.”
Tiffany Wright, Martin’s successor as DCFS director, said the suggestions needed to be more specific.

FW_ Meeting follow-up-DCFS Response 
“I have asked for this several times based upon the two months of conversations we have been having and also how it impacts the larger project,” Wright wrote later in June 2024.
By July, DHS officials expected the project “to continue to move forward as currently agreed,” said Jeff Dean, chief information officer in DHS’ Office of Information Technology.
“We’ll be happy to celebrate with you when the project actually starts hitting milestones,” Dean wrote in an email to RedMane.
At the time, RedMane staff had been “looking to hopefully reduce some of the complexity” of the design of ARfocus, but as of July 2024, there still was no scheduled meeting to discuss such changes, “nor have we been given a list of what areas this could be found in,” DHS’ ARfocus project director, Miranda Raines, wrote in an email to RedMane.
RedMane continued to bill the state during the project’s unwinding from August 2024 to January 2025, according to invoices from the company.
The state is still using CHRIS to keep records of child welfare cases, and the federal Administration for Children and Families considers the program transitional in anticipation of a future Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System, according to its website.
Lesnick noted that despite the problems with the project, it resulted in the launch of the Arkansas Mandated Reporter Portal, a secure webpage for mandated reporters to submit reports of child maltreatment.
“While we regret that the project with RedMane did not come to fruition, we remain focused on bettering our platform to ensure we are providing the best resources to staff so we can best serve families in need going forward,” Lesnick said.

Republish photo only with original story.)As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, Ohio universities are finding ways to responsibly incorporate AI into the classroom. 
Ohio State University is starting a new artificial intelligence initiative this semester. 
Ohio’s two-year operating budget requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to adopt a model policy by Dec. 31 on the use of AI in schools and requires K-12 public schools to adopt an AI policy by July 1, 2026. 
The state budget also created the AI Integration in Community Colleges Pilot Program which requires the Chancellor of Higher Education to award five $100,000 grants each fiscal year to community colleges, technical colleges and state community colleges to implement AI initiatives. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOhio state Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, and Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., introduced a bill that would regulate AI systems in the state. 
House Bill 392 defines an artificial intelligence system as “any system that utilizes machine learning or similar technologies to infer from inputs how to produce outputs that affect or influence physical or virtual environments, including content generation, decisions, recommendations, or predictions.”
“We’d like bilingual students, students who know both AI and know the practice and application of that transformative technology in the context of their disciplines and the fields that they came to college to study,” said Ravi V. Bellamkonda, Ohio State’s executive vice president and provost. 
It’s up to each department to decide how to incorporate AI, he said. 
“We’re not saying you have to use this tool,” Bellamkonda said. “We’re just saying that you have to have familiarity with and fluency with this tool to see if it’s appropriate to use.” 
About 85% of college students have already integrated generative AI into their academic lives, according to a June 2025 study published in TechTrends. 
Ohio State is creating guidelines when it comes to AI and plagiarism. 
“I do want curated spaces where they’re allowed to use it because that’s the whole point of the initiative, but it may not be appropriate in every course,” Bellamkonda said. “It may not be appropriate for every assignment.” 
Research from MIT’s Media Lab suggests frequently using AI tools could reduce critical thinking skills, especially among younger users. 
“I think critical thinking becomes more important in this age of AI because only those people who are really smart in how they engage AI will do really well,” said Gaurav Bansal, chair and O’Bleness Full Professor of Analytics & Information System at Ohio University’s College of Business.
Bellamkonda compared using AI to using a calculator. 
“The use of calculators has not dumbed us down,” he said. “We found other things to do with our brains. … Every single time we’ve dealt with technology, we brought value to the table.” 
OU’s College of Business is incorporating more AI-specific courses including a new AI in business graduate certificate and a new AI concentration for their graduate program. 
“When we ask the students how you see your future in the age of AI and many of them indicate fear, it talks about job displacement and fear and … how many jobs will survive in the age of AI,” Bansal said. “Our focus is that we teach students, that they learn how they can augment themselves.”
Humans “can play a very important role in making sure that AI is used, developed, and implemented in an ethical way,” he said.

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)Whether you have enjoyed a hike to a summit in the Green or White Mountains, fishing a cold-water trout stream, a postcard-perfect view from a highway overlook, or a glass of clean water from your tap, there’s a good chance that a U.S. Forest Service “Inventoried Roadless Area” is to thank. 
But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”
Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whitemountainsroadless-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-08 04:56:23.965836

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS)Ohio lawmakers have their claws out — introducing a bipartisan bill to make it illegal to declaw a cat.
Al Cutrona just purrfected his family.
“I just recently adopted Archie,” Cutrona said. “I’m happy, and it’s been exciting to have him in my life.”
His new cat has quickly become his best friend. As many cat companions know, they use their paws — and their claws — to play, to fight and to make biscuits.
Veterinarian Dr. Aziza Glass explained that claws are part of a cat’s paws and are sharp. But not all cats have them.
“Declawing, the process of removing the claw or essentially the nail of the fingers, the digits, the toes,” Glass said.
Taking away claws can, but not always, cause chronic pain and health problems, behavioral issues and an inability to run, jump or climb.
“It’s basically sadistic,” Cutrona said. “And so I thought, ‘Why the heck do we even allow that in the state of Ohio?'”
Cutrona is also a Republican state senator. He and Sen. Hearcel Craig (D-Columbus) put forward bipartisan S.B. 252, which would ban the declawing of cats. Violations could lead to thousands of dollars in fines. There are carve-outs in the legislation if the cat needs their claws removed for their overall health.
Declawing is already banned in New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia and Rhode Island, along with a plethora of cities in the U.S. Dozens of other areas across the world, like the United Kingdom, Canada and Spain have major restrictions or total bans.
Some people want cats that are declawed because they are afraid of the damage to furniture or children, and veterinarian Dr. Sarah Wallace said cats might not get adopted — or could get returned — if they are not declawed.
“Cats, specifically that like to paw on their furniture or on the corner of couches, it can sometimes be so irritating that owners actually consider re-homing or giving up their cat,” Wallace said.
Cutrona understood the concern, but said that furniture getting scratched isn’t worth harming your pets or possibly losing them.
“There are a lot of things that people can do with it, whether it’s scratch pads, clipping their nails,” he said. “Cats are more likely to get out of the house, to be out and about, and you’re essentially taking away the only form of defense.”
This bill will be heard in the coming weeks.

Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. (Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Concerns about the high cost of energy were frequently heard in legislative hearings, debates, and throughout the halls of the State House this past session. It’s front of mind for many Mainers as prices have noticeably increased in recent years.
Calls for lawmakers to do more were heard during multiple public hearings before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee where people lined up to speak for hours, including businesses who feared their livelihood could be in jeopardy over high electricity bills. 
It is an issue that Republicans in particular have raised, arguing that state policies that encourage sustainable energy use are to blame.
“The reason Maine ranks so high in electricity rates is because of bad policies passed in our state,” said House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.
How concerns about energy costs paved way for a prohibition on towns banning heating fuel sources

However, the actual dollar amount ratepayers end up shelling out each month is influenced by a multitude of factors — some of which lawmakers have more control over than others. While the global markets that dictate prices of natural gas and other energy sources are beyond the reach of state senators and representatives, there are some ways that energy costs can be addressed from Augusta. 
Misleading data 
In early August, new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration garnered a lot of attention by seeming to indicate that Maine had the biggest increase in the country for residential electricity rates between May 2024 and 2025.
Republican lawmakers latched onto that stat as evidence that the policies coming out of Augusta are driving up costs for ratepayers in Maine. 
“Unlike other states, Maine’s leaders have pursued an agenda that prioritizes green mandates and out-of-state profits over affordability for ratepayers,” said Peter Wood (R-Norway) in the Maine House Republican August 22 radio address highlighting that statistics.
However, state energy officials have pushed back against those findings.
Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, said it is hard to understand what methodology was used for that research because that data isn’t consistent with what the state is seeing for customers of the two privately owned utility companies, Central Maine Power and Versant.
“There have been increases over the last several years, but this year it’s actually a little bit less than it was two years ago,” Bartlett said. “It’s been a bit of seesaw in the last few years, but we’ve seen increases in various components of the bills, but it’s more like 10%, not 36%.”
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said she couldn’t recreate the federal data that showed a 36% increase in average residential rates. She said that her office’s data shows that from June 2024 to June 2025, there was a year-over-year bill increase for residential customers of: 20.7% in CMP territory, 11.9% in Versant Bangor Hydro territory and 15% in Versant Maine Public District.
Sanborn added that smaller, consumer-owned utilities aren’t tracked in the same way, but they also account for less customers, so they wouldn’t skew the data enough to bring it up to 36%. 
That data point also doesn’t seem to account for states procuring their energy rates on different schedules. Maine uses a 12-month cycle, but other states could be updating their rates more frequently.
Despite some data discrepancies, energy prices have been higher in recent years than they were 10 years ago. Though, they have been falling since a peak in 2023. And people are calling on lawmakers to do more to stem the cost of electricity at a time when it feels like everyday essentials just keep getting more expensive. 
So what can lawmakers do?

Electricity bills can be broken down into a few main cost components. While there is opportunity for the Legislature to address prices in each of these areas, some of that work is already underway but may take time for its impacts to be felt. 
Much attention has been given to stranded costs, which is the smallest slice of the price breakdown. Also called public policy costs, stranded costs is a catch-all category that can include the cost of storm recovery, solar incentives and a low-income assistance program. 
“If Republicans were in charge, we would start by ending the solar tax known as net energy billing that subsidizes solar panels for the wealthy on the backs of Maine ratepayers,” Faulkingham said.
During the last legislative session, there was a push to reform or even repeal the state’s solar incentive program, called net energy billing, which critics like Faulkingham said would reduce electricity bills for ratepayers. While there was broad consensus the program needed to be adjusted, some didn’t agree with making it a scapegoat for the cost hike people experienced. 
The average customer was paying about one cent per kilowatt-hour for policy costs over the past couple years, Bartlett said, with the typical Maine residence using about 550 kilowatt-hours each month. That jumped to 1.7 cents in 2025, which is a real increase, but not what’s driving the total people see on their bills, he added. 
“The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work,” Bartlett said.  
In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation into law to reform net energy billing and rein in future costs it could impose on ratepayers. While the cost of the program is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Maine Public Advocate’s Office after its passage.
Much more significant to one’s energy bill than those stranded costs is the supply rate, which reflects the cost of what actually generates the power. 
“New England has historically had higher electricity prices than the U.S. average, driven by the region’s heavy reliance on natural gas to produce electricity,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.
Especially in recent years, this has driven up costs for consumers because the cost of natural gas itself is subject to national and global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
While Maine lawmakers can’t control those global market fluctuations, some believe that pursuing more sources of in-state and in-region renewable energy could offer more stable prices. 










The suggestion that we’re seeing these wild increases because of those policy costs… just the math doesn’t work.


– Phil Bartlett, Public Utilities Commission


Earlier this year, the governor signed legislation that will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into the Department of Energy Resources. That new cabinet-level entity will have the authority to do clean energy procurements, which could help transition the state away from volatile natural gas and fossil fuel prices. 
A new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. However, the Trump administration took action early on to pause the development of offshore wind projects, leaving plans to put turbines in the Gulf of Maine on pause.
The remainder of an electric bill is the cost to deliver the electricity to the end user. 
That can be broken down into transmission costs, which are regulated federally, and distribution costs, which is the price of taking energy from the bulk transmission system to the poles and wires that reach people’s homes. 
Transmission prices have increased over the past decade to cover the cost of system upgrades that are passed onto ratepayers. Because New England states share a regional grid called ISO-New England, those jumps have been seen across the region. 
Distribution costs are regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and increases can reflect system upgrades like new poles or substations. 
Because of a law passed in 2022, utility companies are required to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience. The plans should also account for the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers. 
Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems.
“With more low-cost, local clean energy projects, nation-leading energy efficiency programs, and efforts to strengthen our electric grid against extreme storms, Maine continues to work to protect ratepayers and build a more affordable, resilient energy future,” Burgess said.

(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)Writing about children and families of late has felt a bit like watching that Philadelphia Phillies game where an enraged older woman snatched a home run ball from a 10-year-old boy’s father. One generation has been doing its best to wrest resources from another, damn the consequences and judgment from anyone else.
You could see lawmakers in Washington, D.C., behaving just like the silver-haired woman at LoanDepot Park. All but one member of the Kansas delegation voted for the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, which targeted social safety net spending — Medicaid and SNAP most notably — to finance tax cuts for the richest Americans. For all of President Donald Trump’s bloviating about making our country great again, he seems most interested in strip-mining our (unvaccinated) children’s future.
In this moment, it can feel as though no one is paying attention.
Thankfully, new research shows otherwise. Folks included in a new survey from nonpartisan researchers PerryUndem agree overwhelmingly that our country makes raising a family too difficult, and the government needs to do more to help children and those who care for them. I spoke with Mike Perry from the firm and David Jordan from the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund (which co-sponsored the effort) to learn more.


Here are the five biggest takeaways.
 
1. People are paying attention
Perry told me the study was a special effort, gathering both national and statewide data. They also went beyond simple surveys.
“I got to talk to real Kansans across the state in focus groups and ask about their lives,” he said. “This study focused on families with young children and asked them about their lives. I think some of the big takeaways are pretty well known, which are that families are struggling with high cost of living, housing costs, food costs, they come up a lot. And there is this idea that these families are under lots of stress right now, and there is a desire to help them out.”
 
2. The numbers are overwhelming
In Kansas, 89% of respondents worry about the cost of living, 85% about the cost of food and groceries, 90% about the cost of health care and insurance, and 81% about the cost of housing or rent. Polling seldom shows such overwhelming numbers, and Perry agreed that they showed “people just have lots of clarity, these are problems.”
Jordan added: “There’s a lot of common ground and a shared interest in helping children and families thrive, and that Kansas families are experiencing this firsthand. So it’s tough to get platitudes from policymakers when they know there’s a high cost of living and that they know that policy can help be one part of improving their day-to-day lives.”
 
3. They want government action
Perry said the the folks he talked to didn’t necessarily want or love the idea of more government. But given the challenges faced by children and their families in Kansas and beyond, they simply didn’t see any other option.
“They’re backing into it because they don’t see any other way to make progress on these kind of problems facing families,” he said. “So yes, they want government to do more.”
 
4. Kansas, specifically, has fallen short
But that’s not all. The state of Kansas is seen as unsympathetic of those who need help. This, of course, was the whole point of former Gov. Sam Brownback’s HOPE Act, which radically reduced access to family support programs across the state. We’ve lived with this toxic legacy for far too long, but lawmakers in Topeka have only doubled down on failure.
Respondents “feel like it is really hard to get help in Kansas, that the income thresholds are just too low for programs, that they’re not realistic when the cost of living is so high, when food is so expensive, and people are getting turned away in Kansas from programs,” Perry said. “Even though they don’t think they’re doing very well financially, and even when they’re falling behind in bills, they think it’s too hard to qualify for things in Kansas.”
 
5. Fraud concerns are real
Yes, Kansans have paid attention to coverage of waste, fraud and abuse in government programs. But their reactions don’t stop there.
“In Kansas, you can be somebody who wants to reduce fraud and abuse in programs and at the very same time want to expand access to programs,” Perry said. “These don’t cancel each other out, right? And I think some policymakers, some elected officials, think they do, think it’s one or the other, and it’s not. It’s both.”
 
Going forward
These issues aren’t going away. Indeed, the passage of Trump’s signature legislation ensures that children and families will face uncertain times ahead. Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will leave children hungry and sick. And lawmakers that Kansans sent to D.C. helped make it happen.
“We heard time and again that there’s families that are barely making it, and they may be getting help in the smallest of ways, but it’s making a huge difference,” Jordan told me as we wrapped up. “And maybe getting some food assistance, or they’re able to have their child enrolled in Medicaid. But some of these new changes have the potential of ripping away that help, and there’s a lot of fear and worry about that.”
I wish there was a simple answer. I our government could restrain its drive to pump dollars into the bloated ghouls of Wall Street.
Perhaps the best option we have was demonstrated by the Philly sports fans last week, as they drove the angry woman and her ill-gotten baseball out of the stadium with heckling. But that takes everyone paying attention and raising their voice.

In October 2023, a group calling itself Return to the Land established its first “Whites only community” in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. They followed that with a second enclave nearby in 2025.
The group, which describes itself as a “private membership association” that helps groups form “European heritage communities,” plans to build four more sites, including another location in the Ozarks and two in Appalachia.
Return to the Land believes that by calling themselves a private membership association they can create a white ethnostate – a type of state in which residence is limited to white people – and legally exclude people based on race, religion and sexual orientation.
If you read the words of Eric Orwoll, the group’s co-founder, its mission is clear: “You want a white nation? Build a white town … it can be done. We’re doing it.”
As a scholar of right-wing extremism, I have examined several groups calling for a white homeland in America. The creation of a white ethnostate is often seen as an ultimate goal of such white nationalism, which argues that white people form part of a genetically and culturally superior race deserving of protection and preservation. While Return to the Land doesn’t identify as white nationalists, their statements often align with the ideology.
 White ethnostates, big and small

One of the best-known plans for a white ethnostate is the Northwest Imperative, popularized by white nationalists during the 1970s and ’80s. The plan involved certain citizens taking 10% of the United States – the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana – and excluding all nonwhite people from living there.
Proponents of the plan argued that these states were already majority white and contained large tracts of undeveloped land, making the territory ideal for white-only settlement. High-profile extremists of the time such as Richard Butler, Robert Mathews and David Lane supported the plan.
Still today, groups such as the Northwest Front, a white nationalist group founded in 2009 and located in the Pacific Northwest, continue to promote variations of this idea.
While the Pacific Northwest has a long history with right-wing extremist organizing, the proponents of whites-only communities have also targeted areas of the Northeast as possible locations for a white ethnostate.
In 2018, for example, Tom Kawczynski, town manager of Jackman, Maine, was fired when his views came to light, including views that have been characterized as “pro-white.”
More recently, in 2023, the People’s Initiative of New England, a splinter group of the neo-Nazi organization National Socialist Club-131, introduced themselves on the online platform Substack. There, the group laid out its goal of establishing the six states of New England – Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont – as white-only.
The goal of gaining control of multiple states is unrealistic, of course, at least peacefully. Therefore, a popular alternative, along the lines of Return to the Land’s actions, is to establish smaller all-white communities.
In 2013, media outlets reported that neo-Nazi Craig Cobb was buying land in the small town of Leith, North Dakota, to build a white nationalist community. The town rallied to oppose this attempt.
Later that year, Cobb was charged with seven felonies related to confronting residents with a gun. He was sentenced to probation for four years and deeded the property back to the town in 2014.
And in 2021, leaked Telegram chats revealed that Christopher Pohlhaus, a former U.S. Marine and founder of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, wanted to establish a whites-only community in Springfield, Maine. Pohlhaus was developing a military training facility as part of these efforts when media coverage led him to sell the property and move out of state.
 The danger of a white ethnostate

These various attempts to develop a white ethnostate are not simply individual, isolated cases. They form part of a larger movement toward achieving white nationalism.
A major part of white nationalism today is focused on anti-immigrant hatred. That has spurred major acts of extreme violence such as the 2019 murders of 23 people in El Paso, Texas, the majority of whom were Hispanic.
The “great replacement theory,” a conspiracy theory popular among white nationalists, argues that various policies are leading to the destruction of the white race. This theory inspired the 2022 mass killing of 10 Black Americans in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.
The shooter selected the supermarket because of its location in a predominantly Black neighborhood and left behind a white supremacy manifesto.
Communities across the U.S. have successfully resisted the establishment of white ethnostates.
The residents of Leith, North Dakota, did this by creating a website informing people about what was happening in their community. Public outcry also met Pohlhaus in Maine.
As for Return to the Land, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in July 2025 that his office is reviewing the group’s actions and whether they violate the law.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”

(Getty Images)As the school year gets its legs, some might remember seeing double when the Nebraska Legislature passed LB 71 during its 2024 session. The law, a “parents rights” bill, gave moms, dads and legal guardians a number of “rights” regarding the education of their children. 
Included is access to information on curriculum matters — what Johnny and Jenny are learning, testing details and the option to excuse their children from instruction or activity without fear of repercussions, other than Johnny and Jenny missing whatever intrinsic educational value the lesson or activity held.
What many knew was that parents already had the “rights” spelled out in LB 71, hence the double vision. The law codified what school districts practiced.
The parents rights movement has been gaining steam in Nebraska and elsewhere, spurred often by requests for public school districts to ban books from their libraries and classrooms. This space has spent many column inches on the sorry and senseless phenomenon of book banning, including this one that appeared in the Nebraska Examiner more than three years ago. 
I refer to that commentary for a couple of reasons, not the least of which is that in it I suggest rather than banning a book — “The 1619 Project” for example — parents and children should read and discuss it together, perhaps finding in those conversations a deeper appreciation for the nation’s history.
Which brings us back to LB 71. Let’s recognize and champion parents rights. But let’s remember students, too, have the “right” to a complete education, one that gives them the entire story from “Captain Underpants” to “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” to the Harry Potter series to true American history.
Patrons of public school districts, too, have a stake in students getting a full-bodied, robust education. We’re building leaders, thinkers, artists … stewards of our democratic way of life. Why shortchange them? Or us?
To get there, public school districts should adopt policies, not simply to comply with LB 71’s requirements, which are spelled out in the law, but also to raise the bar for anyone who wants to alter pedagogy, ban a book or change a school’s curriculum. While the subjects of gender identity, sex, race and the history of slavery are the usual suspects, policies should up the ante for any challenge to books or lessons. 
Let’s give challengers demerits, too, for dismissing current curriculum that works just because it fails to fit a particular political, religious or cultural view … realizing, of course, that the country has no one identifiable culture but rather a wondrous mix of them. 
A starting point could be simple: Those challenging the inclusion of a book on a reading list or in a school library must first provide proof they have read the book, detailing exactly the offending themes and passages that demonstrate a grasp of the author’s intent. Further, they must also take into account how an experienced and skilled teacher might handle the subject.
None of which takes away the right of parents to exclude a title from their own children, but only those instances when they want to exclude the title from all students. 
As for history, use a policy with the same bone structure, requiring challenges to be underscored with some rationale and evidence, especially as they relate to a topic’s inclusion causing harm to students.
Surely some would cry foul, insisting that they know best what their children should be taught and how it should complement what they are teaching them in their own homes. All good. No argument.
But I would argue as I did in this space in 2022 that no scientific evidence exists that indicates reading books about LGBTQ kids “rewires biology.” And, as was said then, if knowing the facts about slavery makes students (or their parents) uncomfortable, good. That’s the perfect starting point for lessons that could trend toward empathy, compassion and discussions of how we can avoid repeating such horrid history.
Finally, beefing up the process of challenges to school subject matter, by its very nature, gives teachers, administrators, parents, students and even patrons the opportunity to work together to solidify, update, modify and do whatever is needed to add rigor and responsibility to curricula. What makes the news most often seems to be videos of school board meetings devolving into shouting matches when teachers, principals and superintendents sometimes face intimidation and threats.
In a world where children learn by watching, those are the least effective lesson plans we could draw up, rights or no rights.

Carlos Guillermo Smith stands near the crosswalk outside the Pulse memorial site in Orlando on Aug. 23, 2025. State workers had removed Gay Pride colors at the site, but activists used chalk to restore the colors. The state later repaved the site. (Via Smith's X feed)No doubt Gov. Ron DeSantis expects Floridians to be grateful for saving us from yet another woke attack on decency, probity, and speeding motorists.
I refer, of course, to colorful crosswalks.
Just as he has fought to expel books by Black and gay authors from our schools, the governor has ordered FDOT to paint over the flowers, the sunbursts, the fish, the musical notes, and the rainbows — especially the rainbows.
We want guns in our streets, not rainbows.
Speaking of guns, one of the first crosswalks to be destroyed was the one outside the Pulse Memorial.
You may recall that in 2016 a gunman murdered 49 people at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando.
The rainbow crosswalk was intended to honor them.
DeSantis, however, views it as some sort of personal insult.
His political future looks distinctly unpromising AND his wife’s gubernatorial campaign lies in ruins after the Hope Florida scandal. Environmental activists won a temporary shutdown of his Everglades gulag, though an appeals court is allowing it to stay open for now.
I mean, nobody likes the guy, but, by God, he can still teach crosswalks a sharp lesson.
“We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,” he said.
Except the crosswalks were not “commandeered.” Like most painted crosswalks in Florida, the Pulse rainbow was supported by the city government and the citizens.
FDOT itself had approved it.
But in late August, FDOT turned up in the dead of night and ground it off the road.
But this kind of pointless vandalism is happening across the state.
At least a dozen schools in Tampa will see their “Crosswalks to Classrooms” school crossings destroyed, including one painted to look like a shelf of books.
Florida’s government is particularly scared of books.
‘Political ideologies’
Hearts commemorating a young girl who died of a heart condition in Port St. Lucie; checkerboards in Daytona near the raceway; “Back the Blue” in Hillsborough County; bike lanes in Orange County, painted by kids who won an FDOT art contest to design them — all either already gone or about to be.
Florida Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue vows to “keep our transportation facilities free and clear of political ideologies.”
As if violating free expression in cities and towns across the state is not the product of a “political ideology.”
DeSantis says painted crosswalks promote “social, political, or ideological messages” and must be obliterated.
That’s one of his excuses. He’s got more.
The governor claims he has no choice but to enforce a new law — a law he signed — allowing FDOT to withhold funds for road projects and “traffic control” if cities and counties don’t follow orders.
Thing is, FDOT always had the power to forbid street art. That’s why communities wanting to paint a crosswalk sought and received permission — from FDOT.
Now, you could argue that the wrong kind of paint could create a slippery surface.
Crosswalk painters know this and generally use acrylic or other paints that bond to the asphalt.
You could argue brightly colored crosswalks give people trying to cross the street a false sense of security, leading them to just hop out into the road without looking to see what maniac in an F-150 is barreling toward them.
Except the data do not support that contention.
You could argue drivers encountering images of sunflowers or fish or “Black Lives Matter” on the road will be so discombobulated trying to read and interpret the art, they’ll become reckless.
Remember, FDOT said yes to those cheery, often clever, crosswalks.
Distracted drivers?
The crosswalks only got dangerous this spring.
Now, as the law says, “Non-standard surface markings, signage and signals that do not contribute directly to traffic safety or control can lead to distraction or misunderstandings, jeopardizing both driver and pedestrian safety.”
The state’s assumption that drivers aren’t already distracted is demonstrably false, as every human who has ever operated a car in this state knows.
Whether they’re behind the wheel of a beat-up Kia or 4,000-pound Mercedes SUV, people frequently struggle to heed FDOT’s “standard surface markings and signage,” including the scarlet octagon that says “STOP.”
Nevertheless, research indicates they are unlikely to lose control of the vehicle contemplating a pink, blue, and green-stiped crosswalk.
What they might do is slow the hell down. A national study shows street art has contributed to a 50% reduction in crashes involving vehicles and pedestrians.
In Leon County, the Knight Creative Communities Institute worked with Florida State University and local government to determine whether brightly painted crosswalks might get people to drive the speed limit near schools.
Sure enough, brightly painted crosswalks did indeed cause Tallahassee drivers — not noted for their adherence to posted speed limits — to ease up on the accelerator.
Unless you just moved to Florida from Inner Mongolia, you know what’s actually going on here.
Bike lanes and walkways designed and painted by school kids, and crosswalks celebrating a city’s history or its natural beauty or demonstrating its commitment to inclusivity, somehow threaten DeSantis’ commitment to Beijing-style state control.
Children must not grow up in the Free State Florida feeling free to create or express themselves or engage in their community.
‘Conform’
Asked during a press conference what he’d tell Florida children now watching grown people destroying their art, DeSantis said, “We have a representative system of government. People elect their representatives. They’re able to enact the legislation with the governor’s signature and then when that happens, obviously, people will conform their conduct accordingly.”
Hear that, kids? “Conform” your conduct and chant the mandated Pledge of Allegiance every morning.
DeSantis means to bully the people of this state from Perdido Bay to the Dry Tortugas: Expressions of dissent, assertions, of common humanity, civic pride, beauty, and joy will not be tolerated.
The people of Pensacola have been told the large “Black Lives Matter” painting on A Street, the words spelled out with flags of nations that have contributed to Florida culture, is verboten.
God forbid Black people think their lives matter.
This is not a popular decision: The mayor says Pensacola will comply, but city resources are stretched pretty thin, so if the state really wants to rid the place of a “Black Lives Matter” painting, FDOT might have to handle it themselves.
As for LGBTQ folks and their aggressive use of the color wheel, state policy is to erase both the pigmentation and the people.
Remove “gay” books from the library, pull courses out of college catalogs, and scrub rainbows off the streets.
Remember the great essay “The Cruelty is the Point” by Adam Serwer?
The Atlantic published it in the early days of Donald Trump’s first term, but it’s just as relevant now: insulting, attacking, undermining, performative hatred — this how the regimes in both Washington and Tallahassee rule us.
Resistance
Authoritarians want to control every aspect of our culture, no matter how seemingly inconsequential.
No shot is too cheap, no attack too petty: FDOT has just ripped out road signs on Longboat Key
The road signs identified Longboat Key’s main drag as “Gulf of Mexico Drive,” its name since 1957.
The regime wants it changed.
The entire world calls the body of water along Florida’s west coast the Gulf of Mexico.
However, I’m happy to report, not all Floridians acquiesce in this name-changing nonsense.
Some elderly residents of Tallahassee’s Westminster Oaks faced down a county road crew as it was scraping the paint off the yellow and green crosswalk by their retirement community.
Children at the nearby W.T. Moore Elementary School had painted it.
Around 30 seniors arrived on golf carts and walkers. An 85-year old lady lay down on the crosswalk and the road crew retreated.
But only temporarily.
Delray Beach and Key West are vigorously resisting DeSantis’ attempt to destroy their rainbow crosswalks, as is Fort Lauderdale, which is demanding an FDOT hearing.
Fort Lauderdale’s mayor declared, “We must stand our ground. We cannot allow us to be bullied into submission and to allow others to dictate what we should do in our own communities.”
In Orlando, the resistance grows louder and more determined.
After the state wrecked the Pulse rainbow crosswalk, hundreds of protesters re-colored the rainbow.
FDOT painted the new rainbow black.
Protesters colored it in again.
FDOT put up signs saying, “No Impeding Traffic,” and, “Defacing Roadway Prohibited,” and called in city cops and the Highway Patrol.
You’d think they’d be lurking in a Home Depot parking lot rounding up Brown people. At least four people have been arrested.
They were armed — with water-soluble chalk.
Babysitters
I’d be willing to bet these law enforcement officers signed up to fight crime, bust bad guys, and keep communities safe, not protect a 10-foot wide hunk of road.
One man, a survivor of the Pulse nightclub massacre, observed on social media: “More officers babysitting the crosswalk than there were security guards watching the front door of Pulse the night 49 people were murdered. By a lot.”
Our tax dollars at work.
I have news for Ron DeSantis and the dead-eyed myrmidons who carry out his narrow-minded whims: You can’t pray the gay away, nor can you paint over it.
You can’t quash children’s creativity.
You can’t surgically remove people of color from our history.
You can’t outlaw rainbows.
Just as FSU’s football team was putting the finishing flourishes on its win over the Alabama Crimson Tide, the sun came out. To the west, a glorious rainbow arced across the Tallahassee sky.
I’m waiting for DeSantis to declare the heavens “woke.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-08 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA’s reconsideration of the asbestos ban compromises CT veterans,Christina Johnson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/08/epas-reconsideration-of-the-asbestos-ban-compromises-ct-veterans/,"One truth impossible to ignore: unless asbestos exposure is eliminated once and for all, the human cost —especially among veterans— will only escalate.","Asbestos is not just a relic of America’s industrial past —it is a continuing threat that has etched a deep and disconcerting mark on thousands of veterans across Connecticut and the country. 
Previously celebrated for its versatility, this natural mineral was widely incorporated into almost all military infrastructure during much of the 20th century. Likewise, ships constructed before 2002 were also packed with asbestos in their engine and boiler rooms and other areas that needed heat and chemical protection. This extensive use resulted in the asbestos exposure of shipyard workers involved in the construction and maintenance of these vessels. Similarly, Navy veterans’ asbestos exposure also occurred as they both lived and worked in an environment surrounded by asbestos products. 
It took a long time for science to discover that this mineral’s tiny fibers could cause lethal diseases, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer.
Recognizing these dangers, federal regulators began moving toward restrictions as early as 1989, when the country’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempted to phase out most asbestos-containing goods. The last mining operation of this mineral also stopped eventually in 2002. Yet such efforts were only partially successful as chrysotile —the most commonly used form— remains legal, allowing various industries to import and use it in their products. That gap remained a glaring weakness in public health protection until 2024, when the EPA finally prohibited the use of this asbestos, closing one of the last cracks that allowed the material into the country.


But just as a significant stride was achieved, the agency shockingly announced in June 2025 that it would reconsider the chrysotile ban after several chemical manufacturers filed a petition questioning the rule. Rather than standing firm on this hard-won policy, authorities opted to reassess it —a process that could drag on for as long as 30 months. In a troubling twist, the agency also asked the court to pause ongoing litigation related to the matter. 
For veterans and their families already enduring the devastating health repercussions of asbestos exposure, these choices represent far more than a bureaucratic delay. Furthermore, the ban rollback also poses an alarming risk to public health and safety, potentially reintroducing this toxic mineral back into federal and military supply chains.
How asbestos exposure impacted veterans in Connecticut
Asbestos exposure has long been a troubling issue affecting all 50 states nationwide, including Connecticut. An updated interactive map showed that between 1999 and 2017, the Constitution State saw at least 3,865 related deaths, which emphasizes a devastating impact on a coastal state that hosts over 131,600 veterans. Of these, 2,860 were attributed to lung cancer, while asbestosis and mesothelioma, respectively, accounted for 314 and 715 cases. Among the hardest hit regions was Hartford County—which reported about 804 fatalities —followed closely by New Haven County with an alarming 802 deaths.
A large share of these victims were former service members who spent an extended period in contaminated bases like Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton. Nationally, veterans make up about a third of the 3,000 mesothelioma diagnoses logged annually, despite representing only 6.1% of the entire adult population. This disproportionate burden makes one truth impossible to ignore: unless asbestos exposure is eliminated once and for all, the human cost—especially among veterans—will only escalate.
Protecting the veterans means upholding the asbestos ban
The federal government has made meaningful progress in acknowledging toxic exposure in military service. One result is the ratification of the Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, which expanded healthcare and disability benefits for veterans suffering from service-connected conditions, including those caused by asbestos. Yet the logic of such reforms sadly becomes meaningless if, at the same time, policymakers allow the hazardous mineral to creep back into supply chains.
The 2024 chrysotile asbestos ban was the product of decades of science and public pressure converging on a single conclusion —that this natural mineral is dangerous. As such, reconsidering that decision not only undermines trust in public health protections but also places veterans and their families back in harm’s way. And for those already fighting asbestos-related illnesses, the mere possibility of weakening the rule already feels like a profound betrayal.  
Moreover, future service members deserve the assurance that they will be shielded from what’s supposed to be a preventable danger. With this, maintaining the asbestos ban is even more essential to ensuring that the invaluable contributions of those who sacrifice so much for our country are not only remembered, but actively honored.

Trone Garriott held a town hall event at Big Grove Brewery in Des Moines, where she answered questions from the crowd about issues like cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, made through the GOP-backed budget reconciliation bill. She also spoke about nitrate levels in Iowa waters, voting rights and immigration law enforcement.
Trone Garriott, who is running for the 3rd Congressional District in the 2026 election, said the district needs a representative who will listen to these concerns and engage constituents who have differing views.

“Our congressman, Zach Nunn, has not been showing up for people,” Trone Garriott said. “Since he started four years ago, he has not held a single open town hall. Responding to concerns that he wasn’t holding town halls, he said that it would be a waste of taxpayer money to do so — that it would be a ‘taxpayer-funded protest.’ Now, if people are showing up angry, it’s even more important that their voices are heard, because there’s a problem.”
Trone Garriott had referenced a Des Moines Register interview with Nunn in August, where the representative said he regularly holds public events, but that “we’re not going to do what the Democratic groups want us to do and just host a taxpayer-funded protest event.”
Holding public town halls has been a point of contention for Republicans as they face backlash from some constituents regarding controversial decisions made by Republicans in Congress, and the Trump administration, such as cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and to the U.S. Departments of Veteran Affairs and Education.
Nunn’s campaign manager, Brendan Duffy, said in a statement to the Iowa Capital Dispatch that the representative is “consistently accessible to Iowans, holding hundreds of events in all 21 counties and hosting real listening sessions that deliver real results.”






“Congressman Nunn isn’t going to take advice on meeting with his constituents from far-left activists who are out of touch with Iowa values,” Duffy said. “Zach Nunn has delivered $11,000 in tax cuts for Iowa families, $60 billion in direct assistance for farmers, and $50 billion for rural hospitals. While Democrat activists lie to Iowans, Congressman Nunn will continue delivering for them.”






The Iowa Republican’s congressional website states he has held 129 mobile office hours, 304 events with Iowans and provided 120,676 answers to Iowans.
Trone Garriott said that during her time as a state legislator, she has made an effort to reach out to voters of all backgrounds through public events and efforts to engage the community. She said “that’s why I am a Democratic senator representing a Republican district — because people appreciate someone who’s going to work hard for them, care about them, show up for them.”
The Democratic state senator was first elected in 2020, defeating Republican Scott Cirksena. In 2022, she won against then-Senate President Jake Chapman to represent Senate District 14 after redistricting, and won a close reelection race in 2024. Trone Garriott said she would bring her experience from these elections to the race against Nunn, and continue that work in Washington.
“We’re not getting the results we need, we’re not getting the decisions that we need, and we’re not getting our voices represented in Washington,” Trone Garriott said. “We need elected leaders who will show up. We need folks who aren’t afraid to come gather with the community and show up and listen and learn from what is on the minds and hearts of our members of the community, and so that’s why I’m running for Congress.”
Former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst is also running to become the Democratic nominee for the seat.
In an interview with reporters following the event, Trone Garriott said if elected, she would have office hours or other time scheduled where constituents can come in to speak about their concerns with her or staff members.
“I think that’s incredibly important for any community leader to make sure getting your time in with your constituents — and not just the ones that you’re seeking out, but the ones who won’t come to you,” Trone Garriott said.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — Jerry Schmitz is rarely at a loss for words about soybeans.
But when asked if farmers have faith in a good outcome from the Trump administration’s trade standoff with China, his gaze shifted and his brow creased momentarily as he thought about the best way to answer.
“Hope might be the better word over faith,” he said.
Schmitz, of rural Vermillion, is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association and the South Dakota Soybean Checkoff. A checkoff is a fee that’s collected from soybean sales and used for research and promotion of the crop.
South Dakota governor’s economic advisers bemoan Trump’s tariff policy

During and after a roundtable discussion Saturday at the Central States Fairgrounds hosted by a nonprofit called Farmers for Free Trade, Schmitz expressed concerns about the effects of trade disputes on farmers.
About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said. China imports soybeans largely for livestock feed to meet the growing demand for meat among its 1.4 billion people.
Now the country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed recently by Republican President Donald Trump.
“There is not a bushel sold to China right now, and we’re about to harvest,” Schmitz said.
Trump has said he’s wielding tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a negotiating tool to correct trade imbalances with other countries.
The Chinese boycott has reduced demand for U.S. soybeans, which has influenced prices. Soybeans sold for about $10.50 per bushel one year ago in South Dakota, but are now $1 to $1.50 lower, and there are fears of further declines without a China trade deal.
Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective. Noting that South Dakota farmers raise nearly 250 million bushels of soybeans annually, he said a price drop of $2 per bushel translates to a loss of $500 million.

Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.
“We need a deal sooner rather than later,” Johnson said, “because there is not an unlimited ability in farm country to be able to weather the storm.”
Johnson and Schmitz said farmers are planning to store some of the soybeans they’ll harvest this fall, in hopes of selling later at a higher price. Schmitz said grain elevators and soybean processors lacking buyers might have to store excess beans on the ground outside their facilities.
Both also stressed the long-term importance of finding additional buyers for U.S. soybeans. That could include developing better trade relationships with countries that have large populations and growing economies, such as India.
It could also include capitalizing on new domestic markets, such as the possibility of converting soybean oil into sustainable aviation fuel. A $500 million processing plant that will open this fall in Mitchell, for example, will process soybeans and other oilseed crops for uses in renewable fuel, food, livestock feed, lubricants and more.
Those efforts could reduce dependence on Chinese demand but aren’t likely to wholly replace it.
“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.

The congressman said many of the farmers he meets are “still backing the president’s play” to use tariffs in negotiations that could benefit agriculture in the future, but he said high tariffs “cannot be business as usual on a go-forward basis.”
“The president’s trying to use them as a tool to get better deals,” Johnson said. “I understand that approach, but we do not want to just end with high tariffs.”
The roundtable organizer, Farmers for Free Trade, is on a 14-state tour in an RV wrapped with pro-trade messaging. The group advocates for open markets and reduced trade barriers, said its executive director, Brian Kuehl, of Wyoming.
He referenced a statistic indicating exports account for 20% of the value of U.S. agricultural production.
“So if you were to lose all your exports, you’re going to lose farms, and you’re going to lose farmers. You’re going to lose rural America and rural communities,” Kuehl said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2788-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-07 15:56:30.893626

Wes Moore was back on a national Sunday talk show -- his third in as many weeks -- again denying that he is running for president and pushing back against President Donald Trump's threat to send federal troops into Baltimore to fight crime.,"Gov. Wes Moore on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, when he talked about the economy, the president's threat to send federal troops into Baltimore and -- again -- his electoral plans. (Screengrab of NBC video)For a man who’s not running for president, Gov. Wes Moore sure has been making the rounds of the national Sunday talk shows recently. But there’s also been plenty to talk about, from vaccines to federal troop deployments.
Moore, appearing Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” would not say he would “completely rule it out,” when asked about a presidential bit, but he did repeat his oft-stated assertion that he is not running for president in 2028, and is focused instead on seeking reelection next year as governor of Maryland.
“I’ll be serving a full term. I’m excited about reelection. I’m excited about what I’m going to be able to do for the people of Maryland,” he said in response to a question from moderator Kristen Welker, before reciting a list of his administration’s accomplishments..
It was similar to the discussion he had two weeks earlier on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” when he volunteered that he is not running for president during a discussion of President Donald Trump saying Moore is not “presidential timber.” Moore’s residential aspirations did not come up on last week’s “This Week” on ABC — but he wasn’t directly asked about it.
What Moore has been asked about in each appearance was the president’s threat to send troops into Baltimore, among other cities, to respond to crime there.
Moore orders state police to assist Baltimore cops in crime reduction efforts

Moore — who on Friday announced a surge of Maryland State Police into the city to help further bring down crime rates — repeated his charge that Trump’s proposal would be “performative” and ineffective. He said Guard members are not trained for law enforcement and noted that those deployed last month to Washington, D.C., have been reduced in some instances to raking mulch and picking up trash, at what he said is an estimated cost of $1 million a day.
“You know, the president’s proposed budget actually cuts supports for the FBI and ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] bureaus, which are things we actually could use,” Moore said. “When you’re looking at the Big Beautiful Bill, it actually cuts $30 million of funding for violence prevention programs that are happening in the city of Baltimore and across the state of Maryland.”
Trump has said that the presence of federal troops has led to a drop in crimes that have made the District a “safe zone.” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has said that crime was already at historic lows already, but she recently credited the presence of federal troops with a further drop in crimes.
Moore acknowledged that crime is down in D.C., but said it has fallen just as fast, or faster, in Baltimore during the same time frame without federal intervention.
“If you’re looking at the same time period of this D.C. occupation … if you look at assaults with a deadly weapon, they’ve actually increased in D.C. by 8%; in Baltimore, have decreased by 10%,” he said. “And on every other major indicator, from homicide, to carjacking, you could say that Baltimore has actually had the same type of drop as Washington D.C. has had during this period. And we didn’t mobilize the National Guard for it.”
What Moore did do was announce plans Friday for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police.
“We are proud of the progress that we’ve been able to make, and we’re all very, very concerned about how much work still needs to happen,” Moore said at the time, flanked by Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and city and state police officials. “If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that is one too many.”

(Photo by Dan Gross/Courtesy Miranda Spivack)Miranda Spivack is a familiar name in these parts. She’s a former Washington Post editor and reporter who covered Maryland politics, personalities, planning and perfidy, particularly in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, for 20 years. She was a top editor at the late, lamented Gazette Newspapers during its heady heyday in the 1990s, as it expanded from Montgomery County into Frederick, Prince George’s, and eventually, Southern Maryland.
She had a distinguished career as a national political and legal reporter before that. More recently, she has become a fierce advocate for open government and has mentored young journalists both internationally and in the U.S.
And – point of personal privilege – Miranda is the person who brought me to Maryland, hiring me in late 1995 to cover the State House for the Gazette. It’s fair to say that she’s had a lot to do with my own career trajectory over the past three decades.
Miranda recently published a book that is both fascinating and utterly sobering. It serves as a pointed reminder that while we’re forced to digest a firehose of crazy and unsettling news from the federal government, every single hour of every day, we cannot lose sight of what our state and local governments are doing – and what they’re not doing.

Miranda and I will be discussing her book, “Backroom Deals in Our Backyards: How Government Secrecy Harms Our Communities and the Local Heroes Fighting Back,” (published by The New Press), at 6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 9, at the invaluable People’s Book in Takoma Park. It’s one of many appearances she’s making around the country since her book was published in late spring – with more on tap.
“Backroom Deals in Our Backyards” is a look at the efforts of local and state governments to suppress vital information about public health and public safety, often in cahoots with big corporations – and the homegrown, accidental whistleblowers who strived to expose them and sound the alarm for their neighbors.
These are heroes in every sense of the word. Miranda tells five stories: One is about “forever chemicals” poisoning the water supply in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. Another is about a perpetually faulty sewer system in the “Black Belt” of Alabama. Another describes the protective uniforms coated by toxic chemicals that firefighters often wear. Another – the most chilling, in certain ways – reveals the secret algorithms that states often use to determine which incarcerated individuals can receive parole.
And Miranda recounts an episode that received a fair amount of attention in Maryland a few years ago, when parents at a high school in Bethesda tried desperately to pry safety studies from state officials about a dangerous intersection near the school on River Road. Only after a fatal crash at the intersection did the state begin to make data available and respond to residents’ cries for a traffic light.
The resistance these citizen activists encountered was sometimes bureaucratic and sometimes political – or a combination of the two. But the information they eventually were able to publicize was essential to the well-being of their communities, and brought about meaningful change.
In addition to these compelling stories, Miranda in the book lays out tips and resources for community activists looking for help in unearthing documents and other information that the government is withholding. It’s a valuable primer because so often whistleblowers are everyday citizens who don’t really know how to become activists and take on powerful interests.
Miranda and I will be talking about all her great reporting on Sept. 9. And because we’ve both spent a lot of time thinking about – and fighting against – the sharp decline in local news, I suspect that will be a topic as well. Chances are, some of these local governments wouldn’t have been able to suppress information from their citizenry if there had been robust media coverage of their day-to-day activities.
So come join Miranda and me for what is sure to be a lively and revealing conversation. People’s Book is at 7014-A Westmoreland Ave. in Takoma Park. If you can’t catch us there on Tuesday, Miranda will also be discussing her book on Sept. 10, at 7 p.m., at Redeemer Church in Bethesda.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST PETERSBURG- A crowd of around 75 people gathered in St. Petersburg on Saturday to strategize ways to persuade the police chiefs of Tampa and St. Petersburg to void partnership agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they entered into earlier this year.
Legislation signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis requires that sheriffs or chief correctional officers operating a county detention facility must enter into a 287(g) agreement with ICE. That means that every county sheriff in the state needed to sign such an agreement this year, which they all have.
There is no requirement for municipalities to do the same, yet hundreds of police departments throughout the state have done so anyway. In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.
Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.
“In order to foster public trust and a positive relationship with the community, we ask you to cancel this heartless, inefficient 287(g) agreement before further harm is done,” read the form letters that attendees at the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg were asked to send on Saturday to Bercaw and Holloway, as well as Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. The letters were accessed through a QR code listed on pamphlets distributed by organizers at the event.
Threats to be removed from office
Addressing the crowd, activist Karla Correa showed a picture of Florida Attorney James Uthmeier, who has threatened to remove city council members who have shown inclination not to sign such agreements.

“He’s saying, no, you have to do it or else I’m going to remove you from office,” said Correa, with the Tampa Bay area chapter of the Party of Socialism and Liberation.
“He is the attorney general for the state of Florida. He has a lot of power. And he’s going along with Ron DeSantis’ agenda, and we see whenever anyone tries to fight against it, again, they threaten to remove them from office. That’s what happened in Orlando. That’s what happened in Key West. That’s what happened in Fort Myers.”
The Key West City Commission voided its police department’s 287(g) after learning that their police chief had signed such an agreement without commissioners’ knowledge. After they did that, Uthmeier publicly declared that the action had made Key West a “sanctuary city,” which is banned in Florida law. Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.
A similar situation happened with the Pinellas County School District earlier this year, with the school superintendent and the school board apparently unaware that their chief of police had signed an agreement. Once that news was made public, the district backed away from the agreement.
“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd. “Because ICE shouldn’t be in schools. But you know what happened right after? There was a huge public outcry, right? Parents came out. Teachers came out. Community members who don’t even have kids came out to fight against this and to oppose it. And you know what they did? And you won’t hear DeSantis talk about this. They voided that agreement,” she said to cheers in the audience.
In addition to asking the mayors and police chiefs of the two cities to use their authority to cancel the agreements, the activists are calling on the St. Petersburg and Tampa city councils to pass resolutions condemning the 287(g) agreements. And they want the Tampa Human Rights Board to “begin an immediate and thorough investigation of Tampa PD’s 287(g) partnership.”
SPPD responds
St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway provided a written statement to the Phoenix later on Saturday.
“To clarify, our department is not part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said. “We assist ICE only when, during the course of a lawful encounter, an individual is identified as a suspect or subject in a criminal investigation. If it is determined that the individual has an active warrant, we are legally obligated to execute that warrant, whether it’s ICE-related or not, fairly and consistently. We are not seeking, nor do we receive, funding to support ICE operations.”
Attorneys representing the state have informed a judge in a lawsuit filed by the city of South Miami regarding the confusion about the law that, in fact, municipalities in Florida are not required to sign such an agreement.
The Tampa Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oct. 5, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A Nebraska state senator is taking the first steps toward pursuing impeachment proceedings against a University of Nebraska regent charged with driving drunk in a crash that caused serious injuries.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha confirmed Examiner reporting that she is exploring what the Nebraska Legislature needs to do to consider articles of impeachment against NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha.
Kauth confirmed Saturday that she has discussed her plans with the Governor’s Office and top legislative leadership.
“This is such a grotesque abuse of public trust that it needs to be addressed,” Kauth told the Nebraska Examiner on Saturday. 
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, told the Examiner that the charges against her are “extremely serious” while noting she remains innocent until proven guilty.
“If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust,” Pillen said in a statement. “In any event, the question of impeachment is entrusted by our Constitution to the Legislature, and I respect the judgment of that body on this matter.”
‘Willing to start the proceedings’
Kauth is expected to announce her plans Sunday in her regular email to her constituents and supporters. Kauth is an influential lawmaker and committee chair, and her push marks the first legislative move toward removing O’Connor from office. Only the Legislature can do so if O’Connor doesn’t resign.
Authorities allege that O’Connor had a blood alcohol concentration of four times the legal limit, or 0.321%, at the time of a May 21 crash in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood in O’Connor’s district.

Kauth noted that a criminal trial could take time to resolve and said the Legislature should act now because lawmakers do not condone what O’Connor’s alleged actions. Kauth said no one is above the law and that elected officials must be held to the highest standards.
Kauth added she is “appalled” that O’Connor has not resigned or made any indication she would resign for allegations Kauth called “absolutely inexcusable.” The senator called resigning the “honorable choice.”
“I’m willing to start the proceedings so we can make sure that at some point in time she is no longer representing the university,” Kauth said.
Impact of a felony charge
O’Connor, reelected in November to a second six-year term, has pleaded not guilty. Neither O’Connor nor her attorney had an immediate comment Saturday.
“My attorney has advised me of my rights, including the right to a jury trial; my right to confront accusers; to subpoena witnesses; to remain silent; to counsel; … and my right to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” O’Connor said in a May 28 filing in Douglas County District Court.
NU regent faces felony DUI charge from crash that could jeopardize her office

O’Connor, 35, is charged with one Class IIIA felony alleging that she drove under the influence and caused serious injury. A passenger in the opposing car suffered a broken back and pelvis, according to police and court records. Four others were in that car, including three young children. Both cars were totaled.
The father of the children injured in the crash started an online petition in recent weeks calling for O’Connor to lose her law license and resign as a regent after details of the case became public. As of Saturday, the petition had gathered nearly 800 signatures.
“These actions will not only hold her accountable but also serve as a firm reminder that such behavior is unacceptable for someone in her position,” the petition states.
Prosecutors filed charges against O’Connor July 30. Investigators transferred the case from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, which normally handles felony charges, to the Omaha City Prosecutor’s Office because O’Connor, until early August, had worked as a deputy county attorney.
Impact of a felony
O’Connor and her attorney have yet to publicly discuss her fate as a regent. She has continued attending board meetings, including in June to approve the university’s budget. 
NU campuses are considering more than $40 million in cuts. Regents are set to vote on the reductions package by the end of the year.

Under the Nebraska Constitution, someone convicted of a felony cannot hold public office. Constitutional officers can only be removed from office via legislative impeachment if they don’t resign.
If the Legislature impeaches O’Connor or she resigns, Pillen would choose her successor.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista had no immediate comment.
Impeachment steps
The Legislature can impeach an officeholder via a legislative resolution, which can be brought during a regular or special session. In the past, such resolutions have always followed a legislative investigation.
Past investigations have followed the formation of a special investigatory committee, a designated group of lawmakers who would investigate the incident and recommend whether to impeach a state official. Legislative rules require such a committee to be established during a legislative session, yet the committee could work only while lawmakers are out of session.
Lawmakers adjourned in June for the year and are not set to return until January.

Another option: An existing legislative committee with jurisdiction — possibly the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee — could hold a public hearing on whether to pursue a legislative investigation. Both approaches could have subpoena power.
It would take 25 legislative votes to impeach, a simple majority. Nothing would prevent Kauth or another lawmaker from pursuing a vote for impeachment without first pursuing an investigation, but the Nebraska Supreme Court requires “clear and convincing” legislative evidence to convict on articles of impeachment.
Nebraska’s 49-member Legislature, which is officially nonpartisan, has 33 registered Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive.
If the Legislature impeaches a state official, that person is barred from performing official duties until the state’s high court weighs in. At least five of seven justices would need to agree.
The Nebraska Legislature last impeached a state official in 2006. Lawmakers passed 10 articles of impeachment against then-NU Regent C. David Hergert related to alleged campaign finance violations by a 25-22 vote. Six Supreme Court justices convicted Hergert, removing and disqualifying him from public office.
‘Second chances’
O’Connor was elected in 2018 as the youngest regent ever, at 28 years old, and as one of just a handful of women to serve. She is a former University of Nebraska at Omaha student regent.
Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha has defended O’Connor, saying the regent “takes responsibility for making a bad choice, but she’s also doing everything she can to make it right.” Weitz has described O’Connor as an “outstanding” regent who has NU’s best interests in mind.
“Of all the people I know who deserve second chances, she tops the list,” Weitz said previously. 
Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha. Oct. 26, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The NU Board of Regents is officially nonpartisan but consists of 6 registered Republicans and 2 Democrats. Weitz and O’Connor are Democrats. Kauth and Pillen are Republicans.
Regents most often vote as one, and over the past seven years, across hundreds of votes, the board split 6-2 along party lines once. That was in April, when the regents amended NU bylaws to try to comply with an order from President Donald Trump’s administration against higher education diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Weitz and O’Connor opposed the changes.
Message of continued service
Kauth said O’Connor’s continued service risks an appearance that elected officials get a “free pass.” She said she is also concerned about the message to college students, that if they get drunk, “blitzed out of your mind and nearly kill someone” it could be seen as “no big deal.”
She said no state lawmaker believes a drunken driver should have more rights than injured victims facing a “cascading effect” of trauma, Kauth said. The senator said she would call for a Republican to resign if facing similar charges.
“Everyone has hard times,” Kauth said. “It does not excuse anyone from drinking and getting in a car, period.”

ONEONTA — The names echoed down the halls of the Blount County courthouse Thursday morning like a child’s game of telephone.
“Darlene?”
One of the county commissioners was reading from a list of those who’d asked to speak at a public meeting concerning the potential approval of a medical waste treatment facility in nearby Remlap.
“Darlene,” a resident at the back of the room repeated to those outside. Community members opposed to the new facility, proposed by Harvest Med Waste Disposal, wouldn’t all fit in the boardroom where commission meetings are typically held. They also lined the hallways of the courthouse nearly to the building’s exit. One court employee said they’d never seen the facility packed with as many citizens. The woman’s name continued down the line.

“Darlene,” someone further outside repeated. “Darlene,” a final resident echoed.
One by one, community members from all walks of life—business owners, environmentalists, nurses, college professors, healthcare experts and retirees—made their way to the podium to tell their local elected officials in no uncertain terms: Remlap, Alabama, population 2,500, isn’t a dumping ground.
Those living and working in and around Remlap, about 20 miles northeast of Birmingham, have rallied in opposition to Harvest Med Waste Disposal’s proposed medical waste processing facility on Highway 75, a stone’s throw from the Jefferson County line. The enterprise, to be housed in a former tire shop, would sit just feet from Gurley Creek, part of the Black Warrior River watershed, and is located within a FEMA-designated flood zone, according to government documents.

Residents have been vocal in opposing the facility opening in Remlap, citing environmental and safety concerns. David Dyer, owner of Harvest Med Waste, has said many community members’ concerns are unwarranted. His company, he argued at Thursday’s commission meeting, will provide needed jobs in Blount County and bring a safe, environmentally friendly technology—ozone sterilization of medical waste—to Alabama for the first time.
While supporters at Thursday’s meeting included only Dyer’s lawyers, friends and business associates, Blount County residents have found themselves the targets of paid social media advertising in support of Harvest Med Waste, though it’s unclear who is behind the online campaign.
Both Dyer and a representative of Clean Waste Systems, a national company responsible for the sterilization technology Dyer’s facility plans to use, denied involvement with the advertising to an Inside Climate News reporter on Thursday.
“I’m not even on social media,” Dyer said.

Mountains of medical waste

Medical waste management is a more than $2 billion industry in the U.S., according to market analysts, and is projected to grow to over $3 billion by 2030. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that U.S. health care providers generate more than 3 million tons of such waste each year, including everything from used syringes and gauze to contaminated gloves and other personal protective equipment.
All that waste must go somewhere. Historically, incineration has been the primary method of disposal. More than 90 percent of potentially infectious medical waste was incinerated before 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Since that time, other technologies have helped fill the need for medical waste disposal, including the use of autoclaves—machines that use pressurized steam to treat waste—and other sterilization technologies.
In the last decade, ozone sterilization has also become a growing technology, with proponents arguing that the method provides an environmentally friendly alternative to incineration, for example.
Clean Waste Systems, based in Maple Lake, Minnesota, is slated to provide the ozone sterilization technology for Dyer’s Remlap facility, pending its approval. The company uses a technology called “humidizone” to sterilize shredded medical waste, which can then be trucked to a run-of-the-mill landfill for disposal.
Kelly Prchal, CEO of Clean Waste Systems, was one of the handful of supporters of the project to speak during Thursday’s meeting.
“I want to clarify some misinformation,” Prchal told commissioners. Residents in the audience groaned. “Our system is fully enclosed, contained and designed to meet and exceed all federal and state environmental standards,” she said.
Many of the concerns expressed on Thursday weren’t about the sterilization process itself, but instead involved the location of the facility and the risks imposed by trucking of medical waste material into and out of Remlap.

Warren Allworth, a nearby resident who moved to the area from South Africa, cited frequent traffic accidents in the area as a concern.
“Anyone who’s ever driven in Alabama knows that people don’t know how to drive,” he said. The audience laughed. “I love y’all, but it’s the truth.”
When there was a recent traffic accident at the Dollar General across from the proposed site, he said, the truck involved remained in the ditch for days before it was removed.
“I dread the day it’s one of his trucks,” Allworth said, referring to Dyer.
Dale Spain, another resident, lives a few hundred yards from the development site along Gurley Creek. He’s now retired, having worked for UPS for more than 40 years. During that time, he said, he witnessed many, large scale accidents that left hazardous materials scattered along roadways.
“If there is an accident, which there will be, you’re putting all of the first responders at risk, all of the bystanders, all of the people trying to help. And if it’s a bad wreck, this stuff will be scattered everywhere, and they’ll have no clue how to deal with it. Bringing that in and through Blount County isn’t the right place to go.”
Paul Gilbert, who serves as chief of Remlap Fire and EMS, would be one of the first to respond if an accident involving a truck with medical waste were to occur. He said his greatest concern is the sheer amount of potentially hazardous material involved.
“They can do 400 pounds of medical waste an hour,” he said. “If you work an eight-hour shift, that’s 3,200 pounds of biohazardous medical waste. If you work a 40-hour week, that’s 16,000 pounds of biohazardous medical waste.”
Jim Braziel, an associate professor of English at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who lives in Remlap, put it simply: “We don’t want to be a dump for the surrounding counties,” he said. “We don’t want to be the processor for these materials for the surrounding counties or the state of Alabama or the world.”
Braziel and his wife, Tina Mozelle Braziel, a renowned poet who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting, built a glass cabin in Blount County by hand and wrote a book about the process.
At the end of his comments Thursday, Braziel addressed Dyer directly.
“We don’t want your facility here,” he said. “So why do you want to come here? Go somewhere else.”
Residents and environmental groups have also said that the facility’s location aside Gurley Creek, in a flood zone, poses unnecessary risks.
“An individual from Birmingham is planning to put a medical waste processing facility in South Blount County,” an environmental nonprofit, Friends of the Locust Fork River, said in a statement ahead of Thursday’s meeting. “The waste is billed as non-hazardous in the application for permit, but FLFR believes that medical waste picked up at hospitals, doctor’s offices, etc. and transported to Remlap is hazardous waste…a bio-hazard.”
Locating the processing facility next to Gurley Creek, then, puts the watershed at risk, the nonprofit argued.
“If a catastrophic flood should occur affecting the facility, the endangered Flattened Musk Turtle and Black Warrior Waterdog habitat could be greatly altered in a negative way,” the nonprofit’s statement went on. “If toxic waste enters the creek, the threatened Gurley Darter found only in that creek would be wiped off the face of the earth forever. FLFR believes the facility location is a stage for an accident waiting to happen.”
In his comments during the meeting, Dyer dismissed concerns about potential harm to the environment.
“The creek’s a non-issue,” Dyer said. “Why in the world would I invest millions of dollars if I was worried about flooding a creek where I’d be sued to the end of time and probably put in prison if I was dumping into a creek?”

An online mystery

Thursday’s county commission meeting hasn’t been the only venue for debate over the Remlap facility. An online petition opposing the facility has garnered hundreds of signatures, and residents have said they’ve been subjected to constant online advertising advocating for the business.
A Facebook page called “Blount County for Safe Waste Solutions” has run multiple paid advertisements related to the project and the underlying technology, according to records reviewed by Inside Climate News.
The page, launched in August, has run at least three paid advertisements in the days leading up to Thursday’s meeting.
“Being a good neighbor always matters. That’s why Clean Waste Systems are small, safe, and designed to blend right in with the community or facility in which they’re located,” one paid post said, in part. “People living or working nearby ozone processing facilities often don’t even know the system is operating, but they feel the benefit of cleaner, safer, sustainable waste management through a smaller carbon footprint.”
According to Facebook records, the person or group responsible for the page hasn’t yet completed the company’s identity verification process. A message sent to the page by an Inside Climate News reporter went unanswered.
Both Dyer and Prchal denied any involvement with the online advertising on Thursday.

‘We will fight’

After Thursday’s meeting, Mike D’Angelo, a local business owner, sat outside his business, located just a few yards from Gurley Creek and the proposed facility. He’s lived in Remlap for more than 50 years. For him, preventing the new development is about protecting a waterway that’s been a part of his life for decades. He said he’s watched the area flood many times over the years, with Gurley Creek’s waters lapping at the walls of the proposed treatment facility, which is visible from his business’ front door.
“My grandchildren play in that creek,” he said Thursday morning. “I’d like to keep it clean so they can continue to.”
D’Angelo and other residents present at the meeting said they don’t plan to back down in their opposition to the project, regardless of the commission’s ultimate decision when they vote on Oct. 2.
“We’re not going anywhere,” he said, his eyes glancing over at Gurley Creek. “We will fight.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blount-County-Commission-for-Sept-7-2025-story-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-07 08:57:22.504231

But still undercovered in the 20th anniversary saga of the storm that made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, and caused unprecedented destruction is the role that a worm farmer from northeast Mississippi played in helping to revitalize the Coast.
House Speaker Billy McCoy, who died in 2019, was a worm farmer from the Prentiss, not Alcorn County, side of Rienzi — about as far away from the Gulf Coast as one could be in Mississippi.
McCoy grew other crops, but a staple of his operations was worm farming. 
Early after the storm, the House speaker made a point of touring the Coast and visiting as many of the House members who lived on the Coast as he could to check on them.
But it was his action in the forum he loved the most — the Mississippi House — that is credited with being key to the Coast’s recovery.
Gov. Haley Barbour had called a special session about a month after the storm to take up multiple issues related to Katrina and the Gulf Coast’s survival and revitalization. The issue that received the most attention was Barbour’s proposal to remove the requirement that the casinos on the Coast be floating in the Mississippi Sound.
Katrina wreaked havoc on the floating casinos, and many operators said they would not rebuild if their casinos had to be in the Gulf waters. That was a crucial issue since the casinos were a major economic engine on the Coast, employing an estimated 30,000 in direct and indirect jobs.
It is difficult to fathom now the controversy surrounding Barbour’s proposal to allow the casinos to locate on land next to the water. Mississippi’s casino industry that was birthed with the early 1990s legislation was still new and controversial.
Various religious groups and others had continued to fight and oppose the casino industry and had made opposition to the expansion of gambling a priority.
Opposition to casinos and expansion of casinos was believed to be especially strong in rural areas, like those found in McCoy’s beloved northeast Mississippi. It was many of those rural areas that were the homes to rural white Democrats — now all but extinct in the Legislature but at the time still a force in the House.
So, voting in favor of casino expansion had the potential of being costly for what was McCoy’s base of power: the rural white Democrats.
Couple that with the fact that the Democratic-controlled House had been at odds with the Republican Barbour on multiple issues ranging from education funding to health care since Barbour was inaugurated in January 2004.
Barbour set records for the number of special sessions called by the governor. Those special sessions often were called to try to force the Democratic-controlled House to pass legislation it killed during the regular session.
The September 2005 special session was Barbour’s fifth of the year. For context, current Gov. Tate Reeves has called four in his nearly six years as governor.
There was little reason to expect McCoy to do Barbour’s bidding and lead the effort in the Legislature to pass his most controversial proposal: expanding casino gambling.
But when Barbour ally Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, who presided over the Senate, refused to take up the controversial bill, Barbour was forced to turn to McCoy.
The former governor wrote about the circumstances in an essay he penned on the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina for Mississippi Today Ideas.
“The Senate leadership, all Republicans, did not want to go first in passing the onshore casino law,” Barbour wrote. “So, I had to ask Speaker McCoy to allow it to come to the House floor and pass. He realized he should put the Coast and the state’s interests first. He did so, and the bill passed 61-53, with McCoy voting no.
“I will always admire Speaker McCoy, often my nemesis, for his integrity in putting the state first.”
Incidentally, former Rep. Bill Miles of Fulton, also in northeast Mississippi, was tasked by McCoy with counting, not whipping votes, to see if there was enough support in the House to pass the proposal. Not soon before the key vote, Miles said years later, he went to McCoy and told him there were more than enough votes to pass the legislation so he was voting no and broached the idea of the speaker also voting no.
It is likely that McCoy would have voted for the bill if his vote was needed.
Despite his no vote, the Biloxi Sun Herald newspaper ran a large photo of McCoy and hailed the Rienzi worm farmer as a hero for the Mississippi Gulf Coast.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04132613/AP100118024007.jpg,,,2025-09-07 08:57:22.504231

To live in the moment — to use our senses to ingest our surroundings and find an appreciation for every small felicity, in spite of our challenges — can be, for many, the only worthy purpose of life. For others, fulfillment is found in the promise of posterity. And for a third type, such as this week’s featured writer, Oliver Ellis of Belmont, happiness comes from straddling the two worlds: Experiencing new emotions, discovering new convictions through the process of committing them to the eternal page.
A young poet’s manifesto
Oliver Ellis, 14, Belmont
Anyone
can be a poet.
Anyone
can use their gift.
Anyone
can take a handful of words 
and make someone laugh with them.
The pen is my trigger,
the words my recipe – 
for tears,
for smiles,
for love,
and               
for hate too.
A pen is a search engine
without a filter,
and somehow it seems to know
what your weak spots are.
And every day – every single day – 
I pick up that pen and write. I write all the time, because   
someday there will be nothing left.
I use my words as an
excuse.
An alibi.
It’s who I am.
A conscientious
objector to    
conforming
and
being just like
everyone else.
     I think we need more words. Because at the end of the day, what else will be left? Not our silly paper money, that’s for sure. Not our fancy cars, not our mansions. Not our strict laws or closed-minded biases. 
     But I have a notion that our words and our emotions will always be, as a reminder of what’s at stake in this world: nothing and everything.

Many Democrats are calling for a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter at Annunciation and in countless other mass shootings. These firearms, dubbed “assault weapons” for their military-style design and lethality, were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons.
Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the focus on guns, instead proposing increased funding for school security and mental health treatment.
Gov. Tim Walz, in announcing his intention to call a special session, said the public is with Democrats on gun control and Republicans risked public backlash by voting against it.
“If you ask the public about an assault weapon ban, it polls at about 80%. So if you want to go to the next election against the public here when we had an opportunity to do something about this, then I leave that to you,” Walz said.
Banning assault weapons only polls that high with Democrats, but past polls show it does have support from a majority of Minnesotans. So do other gun control policies like requirements for universal background checks, which passed in 2023, and, according to this year’s informal State Fair poll, banning guns in the Capitol with nearly 80% support.
Here’s what past opinion polls found about how Minnesotans and Americans overall feel about gun control.
54% of Minnesotans in 2022 strongly or somewhat favored banning assault weapons




Nearly half of surveyed Minnesotans strongly favored banning assault weapons in a 2022 MinnPost poll conducted with Change Research. An additional 7% said they somewhat favored banning assault weapons. That’s slightly less than the nation as a whole, according to a 2023 Pew Research poll.
That result is roughly in line with an older poll from the Star Tribune, which found that 58% of Minnesotans were in favor of banning assault weapons in 2019.
The MinnPost poll responses varied widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats saying they strongly favored a ban compared to 11% of Republicans. Opinions on high-capacity magazines were similar.


In the same poll, a majority of Minnesotans said that they thought gun laws should be stricter, while only 16% said that gun laws should be less strict.
The 2022 poll had 1,551 respondents and was weighted to better reflect Minnesota’s demographics in age, gender, ethnicity, 2020 vote and region, according to the MinnPost article reporting the results.
The same percentage of Minnesotans in 2023 supported changes to statewide gun safety laws
A different poll in 2023 found that over half of Minnesotans supported changes to gun safety laws. The poll was published by two gun violence prevention nonprofits, Giffords and Protect Minnesota, and executed by Expedition Strategies, an opinion research company.
That poll of 1,300 respondents also showed that the majority of Minnesotans across political affiliations supported the red flag law and universal background check requirement that were  passed in Minnesota in 2023.
None of these Minnesota-specific polls in recent years asked voters their thoughts on firearm safe storage laws, which were passed in the House but never came up for vote in the Senate. A nationwide poll by APM Research Lab found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans supported mandating locked gun storage in 2019, which included 68% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats polled.
(Last year’s State Fair poll found that nearly 7 in 10 respondents supported mandating locked and unloaded gun storage.)
A majority of Americans in 2023 thought it was too easy to obtain a gun


A notebook in a YouTube video believed to be made by the Annunciation Church shooter said it was “shockingly easy” to buy a gun, the Star Tribune reported.
The majority of Americans agree. In a 2023 Pew Research poll, around 6 in 10 Americans said that it’s too easy to legally purchase a gun.
The answer varies widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning respondents saying it’s too easy to purchase a gun. Only 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents agreed.


We see the same patterns for opinions on banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Overall, Americans and especially Democrats supported bans, but over half of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents opposed such bans at the time of the poll.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-09-07 07:57:19.393154

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, speaks at Dakotafest in Mitchell on Aug. 20, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)On July 21, President Donald Trump wholeheartedly endorsed South Dakota’s junior Republican senator, Mike Rounds, in the lawmaker’s quest for a third term in 2026.
But at what cost for Rounds?
Despite calling the senator a “jerk” some years ago and vowing never to support him (because he called the 2020 election “fair”), the president in July praised Rounds, in a 180-degree turnaround, as an “incredibly strong advocate for the wonderful people of South Dakota” and said he was giving Rounds a “complete and total endorsement for re-election—HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”
What a difference several years can make.
For Rounds’ reelection campaign, the direct support of the authoritarian-minded leader of his party and the nation, and of the free world, was extremely valuable — even critical.
“With Trump’s endorsement, Rounds will be a clear favorite to win reelection next year in the solidly conservative-leaning state,” according to The Hill, a leading political news source in the U.S. capital.
Rounds wins Trump endorsement after playing deal-making role in rescinding public media funds

However, as with many interactions with Trump, it was more transactional than genuinely moral or fairly reciprocal. A deal, in other words. But a very bad deal for rural Americans, it turns out.
For the president’s end of the deal, he wanted Rounds to vote “yes” in the Senate on a bill to cut $9 billion in previously congressionally approved funding that included $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The bill, which ultimately passed with Rounds’ support, removed all federal financial support for NPR, PBS and their member stations — and roughly $8 billion in foreign aid.
Trump signed an executive order in May demanding the cuts to the corporation, whose PBS and NPR outlets he has for years controversially complained have been spreading political and cultural views he disagrees with. Congress approved the cuts in July, and the corporation — “a cornerstone of American culture for three generations,” PBS fairly noted — was thus forced to shutter.
Initially, Rounds had expressed reservations concerning Trump’s desire to cancel the funding, but decided to support the executive action after announcing that he’d negotiated a deal with the administration to transfer $9.4 million of federal funding to some two dozen Native American radio stations in several states that depend on the subsidies for their survival. Indigenous South Dakotans are a key Rounds political constituency, comprising 78,000 people, about 9% of the state’s approximately 900,000 residents, many of them members of nine federally recognized tribes.
On his website, Rounds explained: “In order for me to support this legislation, we had to find a way to continue support for these radio stations which offer potentially life-saving information in some of the most rural parts of our nation. These stations play a vital role in South Dakota, delivering critical emergency alerts and public safety information, and they needed to be protected.
“… With nearly $37 trillion in federal debt, we must preserve essential services but also take meaningful steps to reduce wasteful spending. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to both rescind unnecessary spending and preserve funding for tribal radio in future appropriations bills.”

All well and good. But what about all the other Native (and non-Native) citizens throughout rural America? What about their public TV/radio stations — hundreds of them — that are presumably as critical for their communities and as deserving of federal support as those serving Indigenous South Dakotans?
Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voted against the cuts, stressed that “more targeted” means exist to address any alleged bias at PBS and NPR other than cutting all funding, in effect throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It could also be fairly argued that PBS and NPR have long been renowned for fair, balanced reporting and programming, though they arguably lean liberal.
In a perfect world, Rounds would have ultimately voted “no” to the cuts, thus tanking Trump’s biased, mean-spirited executive order that will disadvantage millions of rural Americans. As it was, Vice President J.D. Vance had to deliver the tie-breaking vote to begin debate on the bill when Sens. Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky each voted “no.”
If Rounds had joined those colleagues on their moral high ground, now-doomed PBS and NPR stations might have survived to serve the underserved another day.
But he regrettably chose self-interest over self-respect — reelection over uprightness.

THE PRIMARY CARE CRISIS in Massachusetts and the nation is omnipresent. Primary care providers—physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates—are burning out in record numbers. According to the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, lower-income residents “are most likely to have no primary care use” because of staff shortages and other barriers. Ad[...]","THE PRIMARY CARE CRISIS in Massachusetts and the nation is omnipresent. Primary care providers—physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates—are burning out in record numbers. According to the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, lower-income residents “are most likely to have no primary care use” because of staff shortages and other barriers. Administrative burdens plague primary care practice, and pay is much lower compared with specialty providers. These obstacles discourage current clinicians from staying and new ones from joining. Community health centers, the respected bastion of primary care, experience these trends at even worse rates.  
The crisis caught the attention of Gov. Maura Healey in her January State of the State address, in which she called out the issue for special attention. “I am directing my administration to shift health care resources to the front lines. And by that I mean primary care,” she said. “We’ll drive career training pipelines to grow the workforce. I want a whole army of primary care providers out there, so when you call for an appointment, you’ll get one. You’ll get the affordable care you need, where and when you need it.”  
Just weeks before her speech, the governor signed a health market reform bill that established a 25-member Primary Care Access, Delivery and Payment Task Force to recommend steps to stabilize and strengthen primary care statewide, with a September deadline for their initial recommendations. 
Given these challenges, one might expect that a new plan from CVS Health and Mass General Brigham to launch expanded primary care services at 37 CVS “Minute Clinics” across the state might help. In early June, each filed similar and separate applications for plan approval from the Health Policy Commission to launch the initiative. 
At this point, essential details are too sketchy to endorse or reject the proposal. While the need is too great to dismiss the idea out of hand, their plan is missing answers to key finance, operational, and workforce questions. One thing is certain — the CVS-MGB plan needs close scrutiny.
The plan must be considered in the context of the state’s primary care task force and its emerging vision for a reformed primary care system. We hope that the Health Policy Commission digs deeply into key questions and votes to perform a detailed cost and market impact review, which could happen as soon as later this month, with a finalized report to follow before the year’s end or more likely early 2026.
Mass General Brigham, the state’s leading mega-medical care provider, has a disappointing recent history in primary care. This past May, MGB leaders announced a $400 million five-year non-specific investment to bolster their own primary care system. Without details, it stands as a guilty plea to their underinvestment. What is the connection between this “investment” and the CVS-MGB plan? Your guess is as good as ours. 
More evidence of neglect came from MGB’s primary care physicians who voted 183-26 in late May to unionize. Certification of their election has been delayed by President Trump and Senate Republicans’ slow-walking appointments to fill vacancies on the National Labor Relations Board. Absent new appointees, no union elections can be certified. MGB also has filed election challenges that are familiar tactics of union busters.
More than MGB, CVS Health appears to be the lead driver here, seeking to re-energize their 20-year lackluster urgent care business named “MinuteClinics.” Competitors Walmart and Walgreens abandoned or scaled back their own failed retail clinic operations. 
CVS is now pushing a national corporate turnaround strategy by establishing hospital/medical center affiliations with their clinics in 26 states plus rolling out an enhanced MGB-style primary care model in nine of them, now including Massachusetts. CVS Health, also owner of insurer giant Aetna, fired its CEO, Karen Lynch, in 2024 for unsatisfactory profits and briefly considered splitting the company apart. The MGB affiliation is but one part of their aggressive strategy to regain high profits for their disappointed shareholders.
While nurse practitioners are a huge and growing part of the primary care workforce, the most successful primary care models use them as part of onsite teams that includes physicians. The CVS-MGB plan would keep them solo, with broader clinical duties and physician support only on call. Primary care physicians with whom we spoke see this primarily as a recipe for unneeded specialty and ancillary service referrals to MGB along with nurse practitioner burnout. 
Also concerning are financial implications of this plan. Nurse practitioners would join the CVS-MGB network in CVS facilities as MinuteClinic employees. They will make referrals to MGB providers for specialty care, labs, and imaging plus hospital services.
MGB intends to include these clinics in their managed care contracts as part of its Accountable Care Organization.  While their hope will be to reduce emergency department utilization and costs, those savings could be swamped by new revenues resulting from high priced referrals to MGB specialists and facilities for additional care and ancillary services. 
On its face, this seems to be a high-priced money winner for both CVS Health and MGB.  
The Health Policy Commission should explore the spending implications for 120,000 patients projected in this new arrangement. Should reimbursement rates for commercially insured patients referred by CVS be capped to mitigate pressures to raise premiums that will result as MGB gains market share from this new partnership. Would this scheme weaken MGB competitors who rely on these referrals and will lose market share?
On the flip side, while members of the state’s primary care task force are exploring big systemic changes to set a new long-term future for primary care in Massachusetts, their model likely will require legislative action that could take years to enact and to implement. Meanwhile, too many patients are desperate for primary care services now. The CVS-MGB initiative, while not close to an overall solution, might help some patients who feel the full brunt of the primary care crisis. 
Much more needs to be revealed in the Health Policy Commission review process. Marginal, short-term gains in primary care access should not come at the expense of making the whole system more expensive and less stable. Yet, a long-term solution should not halt viable incremental improvements that may improve care for patients and consumers badly served by today’s structure. Since most observers agree that primary care suffers from severe underinvestment, should we reject a proposal that would make such an investment? A seemingly simple proposal quickly becomes much more complicated.
As so often is the case in Massachusetts health policy, the wisest voice in the room is that of Sen. Cindy Friedman, co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Health Care Financing as well as a member of the primary care task force. She told us: “The notion that this is primary care is disturbing to me because primary care is comprehensive and collaborative. … How do you do that in a MinuteClinic in a CVS? … It presents a false narrative of what primary care needs to be.” Referring to MGB, she added, “If you have $400 million to spend, how about scholarships or loan forgiveness or expanding residency programs triple fold?”
Meanwhile, if MGB president and CEO Anne Klibanski wants to demonstrate interest in improving and upgrading primary care in her own system, she could begin tomorrow morning by recognizing the union that 88% of her primary care physicians voted for last May. That would be a solid signal and a good step forward. How about it, Anne?

The community oven was first lit in late October 2017, built in an effort led by former legislator and selectboard member Mark Woodward and librarian Jen Burton.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Sept. 4
On the Thursday before Labor Day, the town of Johnson gathered around its community oven.
This has been a regular occurrence at Legion Field on School Street for nearly eight years and has expanded to include Halloween bakes and “skate and bakes” in the winter, when an ice rink is set up in the park. Members of the town’s community oven committee, many of whom have been involved since the oven’s inception, pull a pie out of the stone column’s fiery maw — sometimes it’s a classic cheese pie, sometimes a custom creation — and place it before a crowd that devours each slice.
Thursday’s affair was like many of the bakes that had gone before it, but more so. There were the usual pickup soccer games, but this time they were led by athletes from Vermont State University’s Johnson campus. Hardwick’s Kingdom Creamery was selling ice cream and a raffle raised $268 for the Johnson Food Shelf. There were Charcuterie boards adorned with meat and cheese from the Johnson General Store. At a set of grills next to the oven, Jesse Whitworth grilled hamburgers and portobello mushrooms, the fragrance of which mingled with the sound of live music; all 90 burgers were gone by the end of the night.
The community oven was first lit in late October 2017, built in an effort led by former legislator and selectboard member Mark Woodward and librarian Jen Burton. Jasmine Yuris, who now chairs the community oven committee, was there at the beginning, as was Sophia Berard, who was shaping the dough before handing it to her husband, Luke Gellatly, who knows the temperament of the oven well enough to produce pies consistently with a chewy, char-kissed crust.
Yuris remembered the early conversations around building a community oven, following the example of other towns in Vermont.
“How can we make food access something that everyone experiences, rather than this idea of charity, which is just for people who need it? We all need it and deserve it,” she said.
The oven cost $8,000 to build eight years ago and has likely produced well over that amount in free meals since then. In classic Vermont fashion, it’s built upon remnants of the past — some of its stones were once part of a former talc mill in the town, according to Seven Days.
Even as the work of the oven appears straightforward, the labor and logistics required to put on the community bakes is challenging. Yuris made the dough used in the bakes in her own home the first few years before securing dough from Elmore Mountain Bread — Berard worked there as a baker before becoming a therapist. This year, for the first time in the oven’s history, they’ve used actual pizza dough. Gellatly makes the sauce with water from Johnson’s cold spring. Toppings and salad ingredients are sourced from Morrisville nonprofit Salvation Farms or purchased locally at Foote Brook Farm.
Other than the occasional repair to its stone edifice, the oven has not changed much since it was built, but the oven committee mission has evolved over the years. In the early phase of social distancing during the Covid pandemic, volunteers donned masks and gloves, and the oven became a takeout spot.
After the flood of July 2023, the oven provided free food to the community in the wake of the devastation, while pizzas were packed up and sent to the selectboard as it worked through the response. When a less damaging flood hit a year later, the committee considered calling off the bake scheduled for that week, but pressed ahead.
“I remember that was more of a question of, like, we’ve all been through this before. Is this too traumatic for us to still hold this thing and continue?” Yuris recalled. “But it all comes back to everybody’s got to eat, and it’s better to eat together, especially on a day like that, so we just continued and did the thing.”
The expanded bake night held last week was a combined effort between the oven committee and the nascent food access task force, one of several ad hoc groups formed in the wake of last year’s “Reimagine Johnson” effort, coordinated by the Vermont Council on Rural Development in effort to address the challenges the town faced after repeated flooding.

After a successful community dinner hosted at the Vermont Studio Center, the task force looked to hold an August event to benefit the Johnson food shelf, which has seen increased need over the summer after serving over 300 people in July alone, according to board member Diane Suter. Hampered by the fact that, unlike the oven committee, the task force is not an entity formally associated with the municipal government, the decision was made to expand the final bake of the summer for the benefit of the food shelf.
“We’re trying to be additive,” Whitworth said.
The task force and oven committee already share members and have similar missions. Yuris, who serves on both, said that, amid the town’s effort to consolidate the groups, she hopes to see a new food access committee take over and expand the oven’s efforts.
The oven, after all, has become more than a way to feed everyone. It’s grown into a symbol of what can be achieved through collective work, much like its new neighbor at Legion Field, the Johnson Public Library, which was moved from its flood-prone former home on Railroad Street earlier this year. When selectboard member Adrienne Parker and her partner Blake moved to Johnson from Rhode Island during the pandemic, volunteering for the oven committee was what she described as the “gateway drug” to getting more involved in the community.
“After the flood, we liked Johnson almost more because we saw how the community responded to each other. Everyone was thinking about each other,” Blake said. “In the places we’ve lived before, it’s kind of like, you’re on your own. Here, everyone’s thinking about everyone else and being strong for each other, thinking of how you can help your community members, even if you’re not affected, and I don’t know, that’s just really beautiful.”

Those whose drinking water comes from the lake are at risk of exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals from a variety of sources. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Protecting Lake Memphremagog from PFAS must be a priority.","Dear Editor,
I was fortunate to attend a presentation on the geology and hydrogeology of the Memphremagog region sponsored by Memphremagog Watershed Association on Aug. 13. 
I learned so much from Vermont geologists Steven Wright and Jonathan Kim, who is also a geologist with the Vermont Geological Survey. 
It was a great opportunity to learn how our region was formed by glacial advance and retreat over many millennia, how rivers and lakes were formed and how this affects our watershed today. Of the many facts provided, it was fascinating to learn how the Clyde River, Lake Willoughby and Crystal Lake all contributed their north-flowing waters to what became the Lake Memphremagog we know today.
Another point of interest to me is that Kim emphasized that the groundwater and surface water in our watershed are a system, meaning the ground and surface waters are interconnected and constantly cycle, with groundwater becoming surface water and vice versa. Whatever enters the groundwater drains to surface waters, including rivers and other tributaries of the South Bay and Lake Memphremagog. 
This is an important consideration given the location of the state’s only landfill in Coventry, sited in the drainage basin of the lake. Harmful, even hazardous, “forever” PFAS chemicals have been measured in the groundwater wells and underdrains around and beneath the landfill for years. 
This is evidence that PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and other contaminants escape the landfill, enter groundwater and inevitably drain into the surface waters of Lake Memphremagog, accumulating over time. 
Those whose drinking water comes from the lake, including well over 175,000 Quebec neighbors, are at risk of exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals from a variety of sources. 
This is a fact that must not be taken lightly. 
Protecting our lake’s water — and all who depend on it for survival, including fish and wildlife — from chemical contamination from any source must be a priority. 
The state Agency of Natural Resources — regulators of waste management in Vermont — bears responsibility to prevent discharge of PFAS and other chemicals into our environment. 
Residents on both sides of our Vermont-Canadian border deserve the strictest regulation, the safest and most effective waste management technologies and practices to ensure the health and safety of the public and the environment.

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has heard all the talk about Democrats hemorrhaging voters because of unaddressed economic fears. But the onetime physician, presidential candidate and national party chair has a different diagnosis.
“It’s true the Democrats forgot the working class, but we are not appealing to the next generation,” he began a recent interview. “Younger people don’t like longwinded mealy-mouthing, which is a problem in our party. Washington has never had a clue, but it’s particularly out of touch with a bunch of old folks running everything.” 
Dean was 22 when he earned a political science degree, 29 when he graduated from medical school, 33 when he won election as a state representative and 37 when he became lieutenant governor — only to turn 40 and skyrocket into the political stratosphere.
As governor from 1991 to 2003, Dean pushed to expand health care, starting with Dr. Dynasaur coverage for children and teenagers. As a presidential contender in 2004, he plugged into student support by pioneering online organizing, spurring Politico to deem him “the father of all web campaigns.” As head of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2011, he popularized a “50-state strategy” in hopes of growing the grassroots.
Then hitting 75 last year, Dean toyed with another run for governor, only to ultimately stay on the sidelines.
“I didn’t talk to anybody who I trusted who thought it was a good idea, and I don’t really know how to negotiate this world anymore,” he recalled. “I do my banking at the counter, where they say, ‘You could save yourself a lot of trouble if you just go online.’ I won’t because of the security problems. And I’ve never used Amazon. I want to keep my money in Vermont.”
And so the grandfather of three is aiming to embolden a new generation.
“People in their 70s and 80s need to understand our place and get the hell out of the way,” Dean said. “I’m not saying we ought to kick old people to the side or turn everything over to 20-year-olds, although we need a society where they feel they fit in. But I think leadership has to be between 35 and 50.”
Dean admits that can be a challenge in the Green Mountain State, where the median age is the third highest in the nation, the U.S. census reports. The number of older Vermonters has risen by 80% since 2000 — about one in every three residents is now over 60 — while figures for youth under age 20 have dropped by almost 20%.
Dean adds it’s not always easy to hand over the remote when you’ve long held the control.
“As a parent, there’s a role for you as your kids get older, but it’s not what it was.”
That said, Dean isn’t ready to go quietly.

‘The nurse knocks’
Two decades ago, most 20-year-olds knew everything about Dean, the original Vermont youth magnet before U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016 and 2020. But today’s students either weren’t born or in school when the doctor unintentionally made history on Jan. 19, 2004, with his TikTok-enduring “Dean Scream.”
Born in New York City in 1948, the son of a stockbroker graduated from Yale University in 1971, then tried his hand pouring concrete, washing dishes and finally attending the Bronx’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Meeting and marrying fellow student Judith Steinberg, he was rejected by his top three hospital choices before winning acceptance at his fourth — the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.
Juggling jobs as a physician and part-time lieutenant governor, Dean chose not to run for the state’s top spot when it came open in 1990. Then Gov. Richard Snelling died of a heart attack a year later.
“I was seeing a patient and the nurse knocks,” recalled Dean, who finished the checkup (“I knew the patient wouldn’t be able to get another appointment for quite some time”) before his emergency swearing-in on Aug. 14, 1991.
Serving as governor through 2002, Dean proved hard to pigeonhole. On one hand, he was a fiscal conservative who cut income taxes while balancing the state budget 11 years in a row — all while receiving an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association. Then again, he signed a landmark 2000 law creating same-sex civil unions after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that all couples have the right to marriage benefits.
The separate-but-equal compromise forged by the Legislature angered both voters wanting no distinction (same-sex marriage wouldn’t come until 2009) and those who opposed any deal. Dean faced so many threats, he had to wear a bulletproof vest when he ran for his fifth and final term.
Amid it all, Dean helped lead the National Governors Association and hinted at higher aspirations by hosting his 49 peers and then-President Bill Clinton at the group’s 1995 conference in Burlington. But everyone was still surprised when he entered the 2004 race for the White House.

‘The Darkest Horse’
The press soon introduced Dean to the nation, but not necessarily in the way he had hoped.
The cover of The New Republic of July 1, 2002, carried the headline, “Invisible Man:  The most intriguing presidential candidate you’ve never seen.” The American Prospect of July 15, 2002, presented a profile titled “The Darkest Horse.” The New York Times of Dec. 18, 2002, summed up its story: “The governor of Vermont will battle the ‘Who’s he?’ factor.”
Dean told the Times he wanted to follow in the footsteps of President Jimmy Carter, a onetime little-known governor who the Vermonter supported as a 1980 delegate to the Democratic National Convention. But Dean was polling far behind a slew of his party’s members of Congress, all of whom supported then Republican President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq.
That’s when Dean spoke out.
“’What I want to know is why in the world the Democratic Party leadership is supporting the president’s unilateral attack on Iraq?” he was quoted at the national committee’s 2003 winter meeting. “I’m Howard Dean, and I’m here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.”
By summer, Dean was deemed a “maverick” by USA Today, an “insurgent” by the Los Angeles Times and worthy of a cover story by Time magazine.
“Today he has a shot at winning his party’s nomination,” Time wrote in its Aug. 11, 2003 issue. “What’s unclear is whether he has surged because contributors and poll respondents think he is a new kind of Old Democrat — a candidate who will finally revive the left — or because those contributors and respondents know the truth — he is a rock-ribbed budget hawk, a moderate on gays and guns, and a true lefty on only a few issues, primarily the use of U.S. military power, which Dean seems to regard with a mixture of contempt and suspicion.”
Whatever Dean was, “he’s all that and a stick of gum,” political strategist Donna Brazile told the magazine. “He’s that hot. The flavor has not left him.”

‘Nothing to do with it’
By the beginning of 2004, more than 500,000 supporters had signed up on deanforamerica.com, each contributing an average of $77 for a collective total of $50 million, according to finance records.
“I get all this credit for the campaign,” Dean recently recalled. “I had absolutely nothing to do with it.”
The candidate instead points to tech-savvy youth who, in a first, harnessed the web for organizing and fundraising. But they knew more about programming a computer than working the political machine. Dean placed third in Iowa on Jan. 19 (the scream wasn’t the cause, but instead came in response), second in New Hampshire on Jan. 27 and third in Wisconsin on Feb. 17 before withdrawing from the race.
“Dean looked for a moment as if he might shake the political universe with a blunt-spoken, nontraditional style,” the Washington Post reported in a postmortem. “He found the same freewheeling approach that drew such fanfare was an engine of his demise.”
“His vaunted decentralized movement of political newcomers lacked experience and agility,” the Times added, “failing to quickly make or clearly communicate critical decisions.”
Dean went on to head the Democratic National Committee, offer commentary on MSNBC and teach as a senior fellow at Yale’s Jackson School of Global Affairs. Since retiring from those posts, he’s now chair of the Democratic Data Exchange, which collects and shares voter contact information.
“Really smart young people are running it — all I do is keep order,” he said. “The only reason I’m chair is because somebody decided I was the only one who could get along with all the people in the Democratic Party who hated each other.” 
When Dean ran to lead the Democratic National Committee in 2005, Republicans held the presidency and both chambers of Congress. Two decades later, the Vermonter says the situation is similar “but the generation gap is bigger than it’s ever been.”
Dean recalls when Americans received their news from the same national television networks, state newspapers and local radio stations.
“Today you have 10 different versions of everything,” he said. “It’s going to be a big problem for this new generation, which is going to be separated from each other by which TikTok influencers they watch, and for the world in terms of how you establish any kind of notion of what’s true and what’s not.”

‘What’s new about that?’
Dean is a strong proponent of shared context. When his children were in elementary school, he read them an unusual bedtime story: David McCullough’s 1,120-page biography of President Harry Truman.
“They still laugh about it,” he said. “They didn’t feel like it was being abusive.”
For adults, Dean suggests two books: “Thomas Chittenden: Vermont’s First Statesman,” a 1997 history by Frank Smallwood about the state’s founding governor; and “Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State,” a 2011 account by Samuel Hand, Anthony Marro and Stephen Terry of the 20th-century leader who ushered in a shift from Republican to Democratic rule.
“All this shapes who we are and why we’re different,” he said.
For Dean, the books also shed light on the present disconnect between state and national politics — and why he sees hope.
“Yeah, you’ve got a neofascist government, but I’m an optimist, and I’ll tell you why,” he said. “When I went to college, I had two Black roommates. They had never been to school with a white person and I had never been to school with a Black person. My junior year was the first time women were permitted to enroll in the Ivy League. And I don’t know a single person in my class who dared to say they were gay.”
That was then.
“The amount of change that’s happened over my generation has just been staggering, and I have hope the new generation isn’t going to like authoritarian rule,” he said. “I see my role is to coach young people — and offer an occasional intervention when Democrats in Washington get particularly stupid.”
Dean is repeating his longtime calls for the national party to seed and feed the grassroots by coordinating and contributing to local and state organizing. He’s also offering his support to self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in his current bid for New York City mayor.
“Republicans are playing by a new set of rules now, and I think Democrats have got to toughen up,” Dean said. “We don’t have to give up our ideals, but we do have to talk differently.”
More plain spoken, he explained, and less politically correct.
“I just say what I want,” Dean concluded. “What’s new about that?”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)For at least a moment earlier this year, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins was willing to depart from his typical far-right, far-fetched stances to take a position most would label liberal – on a criminal justice matter, of all things. 
Yet just months later, the Lafayette Republican is back to his extremist ways. What’s different now is that he appears rudderless, permanently veering to the right to the point where it could be argued he’s merely spinning  in political circles. 
Heads turned during the spring session of the Louisiana Legislature when Higgins, a former policeman, gave his support to a proposal that would have let people put in Louisiana prisons by non-unanimous juries seek reviews of their cases. The lawman-turned-lawmaker urged the “swift passage” of the bill by state Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, arguing it preserved the U.S. Constitution’s rights to due process and a fair trial.  
“You could not have told me in my 42 years on this earth that I would have a letter from Congressman Clay Higgins supporting a bill that I brought,” Duplessis told colleagues on the Senate floor before they resoundingly rejected the measure. Opponents in the Republican supermajority said the policy change would overload prosecutors and court staff. 
In recent days, Higgins has come out firing on all cylinders but with no clear direction ascertainable. 
On Aug. 29, he sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson saying that he was stepping down from the House Homeland Security Committee after Rep. Andrew Garabino, R-N.Y., was named its new chairman. Higgins, a candidate for the post, appeared dejected after the vote.  
“My Republican colleagues have chosen an alternate path for the Committee that I helped to build,” he wrote to Johnson, “a path more in alignment with the less conservative factions of our Conference, factions whose core principles are quite variant from my own conservative perspective on key issues like amnesty, ICE operations, and opposition to the surveillance state.”
That’s the Higgins we’ve come to know – bitter, self-righteous and steered by conspiracy theories. As he still sits on the House Armed Services and the Oversight and Government Reform committees (chairing the latter’s law enforcement subcommittee), there will be ample chances for him to make bluster’s last stand. 
And by no means will Higgins limit himself to those matters. A week ago, he urged the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services to withhold federal funding from “organizations that push COVID vaccines on young children.” 
It followed his pledge on social media to “defund” the New Orleans Health Department for promoting the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children from 6 months to 2 years old. 
“State sponsored weakening of the citizenry, absolute injury to our children and calculated decline of fertility,” Higgins wrote in an Aug. 20 X post.
Call me a skeptic, but if there’s a group out there that’s least likely to be anti-fertility, it’s probably pediatricians. It’s not good for their business model.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Higgins’ latest play for political relevance came Thursday when he joined forces with Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., Oversight and Government Reform chairman, to investigate allegations that pharmacy chain CVS Health used “confidential patient information” to lobby the Louisiana Legislature.  
Caremark, a CVS subsidiary, is the prescription benefit manager for the health insurance plan that covers state employees in Louisiana. Attorney General Liz Murrill is suing the company, saying it used information gained through that contract to send text messages to state employees asking them to oppose proposed legislation. The bill in question would have prohibited prescription benefit managers from co-owning pharmacies. Ultimately, lawmakers opted for a less aggressive, transparency measure with the support of independent pharmacies.
Critics consider the co-ownership arrangement self-serving, as the management entities have a direct say in how their affiliated pharmacies price – and profit from – prescription drugs.
Comer and Higgins have requested CVS Health president and CEO David Joyner provide a slate of records to aid in their investigation. 
David Whitrap, who handles external relations for CVS, said in an email the company plans to respond to Comer and Higgins. With regards to the text messages, its communication with customers, patients and the community “was consistent with the law,” he said. 
As much as he wants to position himself to the far right, Higgins’ involvement in accountability efforts such as this makes him a centrist – at least on this issue. The battle against pharmacy benefit managers is a bipartisan one, with both sides looking to claim the win for bringing down prescription drug and health insurance costs.
Regardless, it’s a welcome moment of lucidity from Higgins, much like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s demand for the U.S. Department of Justice to produce all its files on Jeffrey Epstein. 
No one expects it, but it’s certainly welcomed.   
For Higgins, more frequent stances like this could help him emerge from the shadow of Louisiana’s more prominent Republicans in the House – Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
But if history portends what lies ahead from Higgins, expect him to once again find his comfort zone on the fringes.

Tamara Taylor has played softball, volleyball and basketball, but tackle football hits different — literally.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“I just like to hit people and have fun,” said Taylor, 31, defensive lineman for Denver’s Mile High Blaze women’s tackle football team. “When I moved to Denver, that’s when I found out about football in general … I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Taylor and players like her are punting football’s traditional gender norms — tackle is for boys and men, flag is for girls and women — with a growing fan base across the country. And the sports world is taking notice: The Women’s Football Alliance (WFA) — home to the Blaze — became the first women’s tackle football league to secure a multiyear network deal with ESPN2, and the league’s national championship has been broadcast on the sports network for the last three years.
This year’s national championship brought in 969,000 total live viewers, making it the most-watched game on ESPN2 that day. The WFA’s St. Louis Slam took home the win against the DC Divas with a final score of 26-14.
The WFA has also announced expansion into Canada this year. The women’s tackle league has partnered with Cosmos Sports & Entertainment, a sports marketing firm based in Ontario, to identify cities in Canada that could host a team.

Lisa King, a former semi-professional soccer player, founded the WFA in 2009. The alliance is the oldest and largest women’s tackle football league in the world. With 60 teams across three divisions, the league has 12 professional teams.
King was interested in playing football throughout her childhood, but her parents denied her opportunity. After graduating from college, she jumped at the chance to play for a women’s tackle football team in Los Angeles. In founding the league, she wanted to use a similar structure as the soccer teams she had excelled in and bring it to women’s tackle football.
Ten years later, in 2019, Odessa Jenkins, a former player for the WFA, expanded opportunities by creating the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC). Made up of 17 teams, the WNFC may be smaller in size, but has made an impact on the future of women in football by having a robust branding infrastructure in place to amplify the sport, including creative direction. Jenkins, who played and coached for the WFA’s Dallas Elite, aims to expand opportunities for women football players so that they get the level of recognition they deserve.
For the WNFC, this year marks the first time they have broadcast their national championship game on ESPN2. The matchup between the Texas Elite Spartans and Washington Prodigy came with a new high in digital engagement. The broadcast gained 150,000 championship viewers and more than 150,000 followers on Instagram, a 61% increase since 2024. The league’s TikTok account also doubled since last year, with over 46,000 followers.
And ideally, that recognition will come with pay for players — in the WNFC and the WFA. While neither league provides a salary for players, the WNFC does offer prize money to championship teams. With help from sponsorships by brands like Adidas, Dove and Riddell, the WNFC provided players on the championship team with $20,000. The WFA did not provide a monetary prize for the championship, but was able to cover some costs for players.
“It’s truly a pay-to-play type of situation because we’re not paying these wonderful athletes,” said Rob Sandlin, head coach of the Mile High Blaze, who noted that the financial strain and dedication required can be the biggest challenges for players new to the sport. “We try to be as brutally honest as possible when it comes to what to expect. The one thing that most rookies don’t quite understand is the level of dedication that’s required.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Players must pay dues to remain part of the team, but payment doesn’t guarantee they’ll see time on the field.
“The physical aspects we can explain. The mental parts of the competition can be explained. The idea of how much work you have to put into it is probably the one thing that I get back from people that decide, ‘Yeah, I can’t do this,’ more than anything,” he said.
According to sports news site Marca, the average NFL salary in 2024 was about $3.2 million. While women don’t play for NFL teams, there has been growth in opportunities for women to be on staff. The NFL now has the most full-time women coaches of any professional men’s sports league, with 15 women holding coaching positions across departments.
While girls have access to flag football, a low-contact variant of tackle football, the sport traditionally separates based on gender as young athletes get older. Youth flag football has co-ed opportunities for players ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Tackle football more commonly has restrictions on girls and women playing, both during adolescence and adulthood.
Women’s flag football is seeing growth of its own, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics announcing that they will have women’s flag football teams competing for the first time. The NFL has also received bids for future investments in women’s professional flag football leagues this year.
Challenges aside, being in a high-contact sport as a woman has proven to be a unique and rewarding experience for these football players, whether they started playing as children with their siblings or discovered tackle as adults.
For Yolanda “YoYo” Searcy, football was etched in her life at a young age. Breaking with tradition, her Florida high school offered her a spot on the all-boys football team.
“The head coach coached all my siblings and was like, ‘I know what you can do,’” she said.
She declined and joined a school-sanctioned flag football team instead. Years later, she got her chance to play with other tackle-loving women as a linebacker with the Mile High Blaze.
Rosa Climaco, who has been an offensive lineman for the WNFC’s Washington Prodigy for three years, feels she could have benefited from finding football earlier. As someone interested in incorporating fitness into her lifestyle, Climaco finds football to be the perfect choice.
“One night scrolling on Instagram at 3 a.m., I found [WFA player] Lois Cook’s Instagram and just started going down the rabbit hole. I’m like, ‘Whoa, there is a legitimate football league that exists for women,’ and really the only regret I have is that I found it when I was 31,” she said.
Some players find that they have to balance the societal expectation for women to curb aggression with the demand for them to play rough to win.
“I personally think there’s caution tape around aggression even still in women’s football,” said Kourtney “KP” Purham, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy. “The idea for men obviously is to be aggressive at its most violent level. One of the things our coach says this year is ‘I support organized violence,’ but it’s like him selling that to us because women are taught not to be that way.”
“So, you’re now trying to navigate through what violence looks like in a sport that was designed for men to be violent and still how to be a lady in a violent sport,” Purham said.

Tapping into aggression comes more naturally to some of these athletes than others. While some players found tackle football to be a place where they could release that side of their personalities, others have had to embrace their aggressive side for the first time.
“A lot of the time for me, it was always, ‘You’re too loud, you’re too rough, you’re too this, you’re too that,’” said Washington Prodigy linebacker and captain Ramzeh Deen-sie.“I was still seeking a way to get out my aggression and just be who I am in my true, natural self.”
Deen-sie describes her transition from playing offense to playing defense as a perfect fit for her personality.
“It was just like, ‘OK, you want me to tackle whoever got the ball. You want me to put my shoulder pads through their chest and make sure they cannot come get you the next play,’” she said. “‘I can do that cause I’m already aggressive, I like to fight, I’m always on 10. I can do this.’”
Tonique’a Jackson, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy, has a much different relationship with aggression. For her, focusing on protecting her teammates has allowed her to move with more force on the field.
“I think trying to find that aggressive part of me, it took a really really long time. If it wasn’t being knocked over, if it wasn’t being tripped up, if it wasn’t being yelled at, it’s like you have to tap into the dog inside of you ’cause it’s either beat or be beaten, and that’s where my aggression comes from,” she said.
Outside of pushing her to explore her self-expression, playing football has also allowed Jackson to carry on a family legacy.
“In 2021, I lost my son to gun violence. He was very big in football, and [it was] something that was really, really important to him,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to not only stay connected to him but to also keep his dream alive because I felt like it was taken from him at such a short time in his life.”
Players say they’re satisfied with the growing recognition for their sport — and their representation in it.
“Just to see now with the progression of us being kind of everywhere, involved in coaching at the high school level, too, we’re getting a lot more fans out,” said Mile High Blaze quarterback Kimberly Santistevan. “Whether they know us directly or they’ve heard of us and they want to see us and check us out … the stands are getting fuller and fuller every year.”

The state Fish & Wildlife Department is leading a study to find out. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Why is Vermont’s bear population booming?.","Vermont Fish & Wildlife staff measure a black bear as part of a newly launched survey this summer. Photo courtesy of Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department.  
For the fourth year in a row, Vermont’s black bear population size far outpaced what the state projected. 
Last year, the state had an estimated 6,800 to 8,000 bears, nearly double the objective of 3,500 to 5,500 bears, outlined by a Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department population model.
Why is the population doing so well? There are two big factors that determine population size, said Jaclyn Comeau, the Black Bear Project leader at the state Fish & Wildlife Department: mortality rates and reproduction rates.
The state has a pretty good sense of what is influencing bear mortality, she said. Hunters are responsible for most premature bear deaths, followed by vehicle collisions. Freak accidents, like a bear chewing an electrical wire, can also cause a bear’s early death. Still, populations are continuing to “grow and grow,” Comeau said. 
Looking at reproduction is “kind of that missing piece of information that we don’t have” when it comes to understanding what drives that trend, according to Comeau. A new study launched this summer aims to tackle that question and better pinpoint what type of habitat and food availability supports healthy bear birth rates.
Since the 1980s, the “backbone” to steady population growth has been the wider recovery of suitable habitat for bears, Comeau said, as forest grew back across a landscape previously dominated by deforestation and farm land. The agricultural Vermont of the 1940s and 1950s left bears confined to the spine of the Green Mountains, she said. In those days, killing bears was far more common, without the hunting regulations and restricted season Vermont has today.
Still, the Fish & Wildlife Department would like to better understand how availability of different food sources might influence where the bears go and how successful they are in reproduction, especially as they spread down from the mountains. 
In the mountains, beechnuts are bears’ primary fall food source, but the trees’ nut production pulses every two or three years. Historically, bear populations have risen and fallen with these cycles.  
In the valleys, oak trees — and thus, acorns — are more abundant and more consistent.
“We’re wondering if now that the bear population has moved out of the mountains, if they’re accessing higher-quality habitat where food is more consistent,” Comeau said. “Now that they’re in the valleys, potentially, the habitat might be more productive and allowing their populations to grow.” 
To answer that, the department’s study follows 18 adult female bears fitted with GPS tracking collars that allow biologists to see where the bears are, presumably getting food. The study aims to isolate these two distinct habitat areas by looking at nine bears in the Connecticut River Valley and nine others in the southern Green Mountains. In the winter, the scientists will visit the bears’ dens to confirm how many cubs the mother has, with the intent of following the family and cub survival through their first year of life. Fish & Wildlife anticipates letting the survey run for six years in order to collect enough data to draw conclusions.
Better understanding the conditions in which bears are thriving will allow the department to better protect and manage their habitat, Comeau said. 
The prosperity of Vermont’s black bears is a rare success, as many species decline due to habitat loss, changes in food availability and environmental shifts, among a range of other environmental shifts brought on by climate change. 
Black bears are especially flexible when it comes to habitat and food. As omnivores, they can survive off multiple food sources, and their wide range, from Florida and Mexico to Canada, shows they can adapt to a variety of habitats and temperatures.
Still it does not mean that a changing climate will leave the bears unaffected, Comeau said. 
Comeau worries what the encroachment of beech leaf disease in Vermont’s forests will mean for the bear population over the next decade. 
And as Vermont’s winter season shrinks, people should expect bears to enter hibernation later in the year and emerge earlier in the spring. That, plus a growing population spreading beyond the mountains, makes bears more likely to encounter humans. For Comeau, this underscores a need to figure out how to foster the best coexistence.
The department added that Vermont’s bear hunting season started Monday and runs through Nov. 14. Hunters are allowed to kill collared bears, but Fish & Wildlife asks that they avoid killing bears accompanied by cubs and that they return any collars.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-07 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Funding for special ed in CT got a bump this year, but is it enough?",Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/07/ct-special-education-funding-2025/,"CT injected $70 million more for special education, but it isn't enough to meet many districts' needs. Officials are trying to fill the gaps.","Lisa Balzano’s recent visit to a Fairfield high school left her floored by one sight in particular: a supply room stocked with almost anything a teacher would need. 
“She opened this room with supplies, and I almost fell over,” Balzano recalled. “I said, ‘What’s this?’”
Balzano is a special education teacher at Bridgeport Military Academy, where she buys her own tissues, pens, pencils, markers and more. Anything she needs, she purchases — except for paper. Teachers are allocated two reams a month. 
“That was a year or two ago, and it’s still embedded in my brain how it was just Fairfield,” Balzano said. “It’s 10 minutes from where I live, and it’s just completely different.”
As a Bridgeport educator working in special education for nearly 20 years, Balzano is no stranger to shortages. A position went unfilled last school year, and Balzano’s caseload jumped from 25 students to around 40 students. While it was normal for her, Balzano said she’s heard that other towns consider a caseload of 25 students high.
Special education programs across the state have been historically underfunded, and some urban districts like Bridgeport and New Britain — as well as smaller rural districts, like Thompson — have struggled especially to support their special education students because of lower teacher pay or limited access to resources.
Statewide, special education accounts for a large portion of district budgets. From 2023 to 2024, districts in the state spent, on average, almost a quarter of their total expenditures on special education.
Earlier this year, in a move many educators said was long overdue, Gov. Ned Lamont and the state legislature injected an additional $70 million into special education. Of that, $40 million was allocated as an emergency grant for the fiscal year that ended June 30 and $30 million went toward a new grant for fiscal year 2026. But this money still isn’t nearly enough to meet the needs in many districts, and officials are working to fill in the gaps.
Spending is high, but students are struggling
Some districts spend over 30% of their annual budgets on special education. But such high levels of spending don’t necessarily mean students are getting what they need. 
When a district can’t meet a student’s level of need, that student may be sent to a school in another district or placed in a private school or facility. But this has historically been very costly for districts.
The costs are due to a variety of factors, said Michael Morton, deputy executive director of operations and communications for the School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy organization.
“When you have historically underfunded districts, they’re not going to have the resources to build in-district programming,” Morton said. “As a result of that, you are going to have a lot more students being sent out of district, which results in increased costs.”
And that raises other costs, Morton said. “You’re also paying for transportation to make sure those students get to a place where they can get the services that they deserve and are legally entitled to.”
Districts statewide spent around $268 million on transportation for all special education students in the 2023-24 school year and just under $700 million on tuition.
Michele McKinley, who heads up special education for Bridgeport schools, said the district outplaces anywhere between 250 and 300 students — which comes with a high cost.
“Out-of-district placement may cost $200,000, and that’s on the low end. Well, we don’t get $200,000 per student,” McKinley said, referring to state funding. “So then that’s additional funds that we have to go into the general budget to pull to ensure that we are meeting that student’s needs. Because ultimately, we have to meet the individual student’s needs.”
“There just aren’t the funds to support the legal requirements. And that’s a real problem.”Andrew Feinstein, attorney
Bridgeport faced significant teacher shortages last year, with 24 special education teacher vacancies and 46 paraeducator vacancies, according to a complaint filed in June by the Center for Children’s Advocacy. The complaint detailed allegations from families who said their children regressed due to inadequate staffing of educators with no special education training. 
One student was allowed, on multiple occasions, to hit their head against a wall hundreds of times, according to the complaint. 
McKinley said the district has already begun addressing issues in the complaint.
Bridgeport is in a better position this upcoming school year, with only three special education teacher vacancies as of Aug. 15, according to Bridgeport Public Schools. McKinley said “a lot of intentional work” went into recruiting and retention initiatives.
But funding disparities mean some districts face steeper challenges than others. Districts in Connecticut get around 57% of their education funding from local property taxes, according to the School and State Finance Project. That means more affluent towns tend to have more money to spend on education. 
Both New Britain and Greenwich put around 27% of their total education expenditures towards special education in 2023-24, a bit above the state-wide average of 23.7%. But taking into account each town’s tax revenues, and the number of students they serve, there was a more-than $20,000 disparity between New Britain and Greenwich in per-pupil expenditures for students in special education. 
Greenwich spent over $50,800 per special education student, while New Britain spent $25,686 per special education student.
In Bridgeport, where Balzano works, nearly 30% of all education expenditures went towards special education; That amounted to $28,081 per pupil in special education. 
Some less affluent districts — that can’t provide the qualified staff or infrastructure required by law for special education students — spend millions of dollars to send students to schools outside the district.
Outplacements strain Bridgeport’s budget significantly, McKinley said. But the district is currently building a new facility for students with “complex learning needs” that would house around 260 students. She said she hopes this will save the district money and provide students with the services they need.
 If special education costs exceed what the district has budgeted, McKinley said they have to tap into funds that are intended to cover other things. 
“That’s the importance of the new facility that we’re building, it’s to provide some of those services where we have had to send students out of district — to provide those services in district.” McKinley said.

Like most things, special education has gotten more expensive
Special education costs have risen steeply in recent years for districts across the country. In Connecticut, the number of special education students has steadily increased despite an overall decline in statewide enrollment.
Andrew Feinstein, a special education attorney, said districts statewide are struggling to hire educators. The state Department of Education has also highlighted the problem. This shortage is exacerbated in districts that offer less-competitive salaries, typically lower-income districts.
“Cost, of course, escalated enormously in special ed,” Feinstein said. “We are reaching the real area of scarcity, where there just aren’t the funds to support the legal requirements. And that’s a real problem.”
Six years ago, districts were putting a smaller portion — closer to 20% — of education expenditures towards special education. Districts now are dishing out over 25%. And students are still struggling.

Naomi Nova is involved in the special education system as a parent, special education attorney and as the vice president of Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut, or SEEK. Nova came face-to-face with the impacts of staff shortages after a recent planning and placement team meeting. (Nova wanted to clarify that at this meeting, the board was not represented by an attorney.)
In the parking lot, as she was leaving, Nova was approached by one of the evaluators.
“It wasn’t a confrontational meeting at all, but she came up to me in tears after the meeting, grabbed me in the parking lot and told me that there were so many more assessments and things that she wanted to recommend and do to help students, and that she couldn’t do it because her number of evaluations that she was now expected to do was so high that there just weren’t enough hours in the day,” Nova said.
Nova said families sometimes seek supplemental support for their children outside of the school system, but that can present financial challenges.
“These are huge expenses, and they’re huge expenses for any family,” Nova said. “But for people who can’t afford it, it’s truly devastating.”
What’s the state doing?
The Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation creating additional grants to fund special education during the 2025 legislative session in an effort to help districts, their students and staff.
The bill passed in June included the creation of the Special Education Expansion and Development (SEED) grant that will allocate $60 million over the next two fiscal years, or $30 million a year. The general assembly also approved a High Quality Special Education Incentives grant to allocate $9.9 million in FY 2027 among other initiatives targeted at managing costs in special education.
If the grant were fully funded — which it is not — it would allocate over $190 million across the state. Under the current allocation, it provides a few less-populated towns with just a few hundred dollars for the year. 
“I don’t think anyone would say it is [a magical solution],” Morton, of the School and State Finance Project, said. “But it is a step in the right direction to hopefully making sure that we have a special education system that is not only well funded but is making sure that every student is getting the services that they are legally entitled to.”
Before the creation of the SEED grant, state special education funding was primarily distributed through two grants: the Excess Cost grant and the Education Cost Sharing grant. The Excess Cost grant is a high-cost service funding grant that partially reimburses districts for the cost of some special education students. To cover additional special education costs, districts pull money from the state’s general education funding, distributed under the Education Cost Sharing grant. 
[RELATED: How are CT schools funded? What to know about the ECS formula]
Connecticut is one of the only states in the nation that did not distribute state funding for special education through a dedicated formula prior to FY 2026.
Districts can request reimbursement through the Excess Cost grant for the cost of students exceeding the basic contribution, or when a student’s education costs over 4.5 times the district’s average expenditure per student from the prior year.
The grant also fully reimburses districts for students requiring special education services placed by the state. This includes students who may be attending an out-of-district school because of a foster care placement. 

But these grants don’t typically meet districts’ needs, leaving local school systems to pay the difference. For districts, this creates what Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut Education Association, calls a “disaster in local budgeting.”
“You’re talking about some districts having to make up three, four, five million dollars because the Excess Cost grants were only funded to 60%,” Dias said. “You had the federal government not meeting its obligation, the state not meeting its obligation, but the services have to be provided and then paid for at the local level, causing these incredible pressures.” 
That’s led districts like Bridgeport to place special education students in costly private schools. A federal report from 2023 found that Connecticut outplaced 6.3% of all special education students — the highest rate in the nation.
Some students require district outplacement for their learning needs, but many need mid-tier interventions they can’t get in their districts. With the newly approved SEED grant, and additional future funding, Dias is hopeful districts can create collaborative centers for students to receive “the lowest level of intervention with the highest level of impact.” 
“These ideas of regional centers are going to have to take root in some capacity,” Dias said. “We can’t afford to continuously outsource special education. We’re going to have to figure out, how do we create something different?” 
A new approach
That “something different” may look unconventional on the outside — like the Farmington Valley Diagnostic Center. 
The center, directed by Sara Steinberg, is a temporary school for 6th through 12th graders located in a small one-story building in Simsbury. The goal of the school isn’t to keep students enrolled — rather, it seeks to send them back to their home districts.
Overseen by the Capitol Region Education Council, the FVDC allows member districts to purchase a certain number of seats at the beginning of the school year at a much lower cost than conventional private outplacements. 
Steinberg said memberships cost “far less” than what a conventional outplacement would cost since the center is not looking to make a profit.
Steinberg said FVDC is “scrappy,” transforming closets into reboot rooms with pillows and calming lights for students and bringing in community members with service dogs to interact with students weekly — for free. The school, which has been open since 1998, recently purchased new furniture for the first time in the history of the center.
Around half of the students at FVDC have reached a point where they are refusing to attend school in their home district, and many have undergone severe trauma, Steinberg said. The goal of the center is to realign and reset students in a standard 8- to 12-week period placement. Steinberg has seen countless success stories from students who leave the center and return to their home districts.
“Our systems are not always set up for early intervention, unfortunately, but this is actually an example of earlier intervention,” Steinberg said. “It’s an opportunity to do something in a supportive, proactive way and seeing then what the next step is.” 
Sometimes, students are still sent to outplacement programs if they can’t return to their district. But the program offers a step before outplacement that many districts, especially smaller districts, don’t have the bandwidth to offer, Steinberg said.
“I do think if we can create these smaller settings within larger settings, there’s a place for that,” Steinberg said, adding that SEED grant funding could bolster that effort.

House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, co-sponsored the bill that provided for SEED grants during this year’s legislative session, and he said it’s a good opportunity to fund intervention to support students with lower-levels of need.
“So this is hopefully an incentive for communities to come together and say, ‘Can we pool our resources and educate some of these kids instead of sending them to other places where it’s more expensive?’” Ritter said. 
In addition to Bridgeport’s announcement of its new school tailored to special education students, Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti has said he wants to open a regional special education school. 
Morton said he believes the special education bills passed may allow districts to consider expanding resources. “People are more likely to consider — because of the additional funds that are being provided and the additional incentives — [creating] in-district or multidistrict programming, rather than relying on outplacing students,” Morton said.
The SEED grant won’t solve all the problems in special education in Connecticut, but, Ritter said, “You’ve got to take a step to walk a mile.”
Not a ‘magical fix’
As the staffing shortage continues, educators like Balzano see the impacts of underfunding each day. Statewide teacher shortages are exacerbated in less affluent districts because of lower incomes, fewer resources and larger class sizes and caseloads.
When Balzano had around 40 students on her caseload, she not only had to fill out paperwork for each of the students, she also had to teach them.
“I was spread very, very thin,” she said. “And I heard some teachers stay at school till 8:00 at night. I just can’t do that. I can’t and I won’t do that.”
Balzano was able to get her work done and not stay late because of an agreement established through the Bridgeport Education Association and the Bridgeport Board of Education that allowed educators to get coverage for classes if they needed additional time to finish paperwork. Even though the vacant position is now filled, Balzano said there is still a lot of teacher turnover in the district, and people often leave for higher paying positions in the state.
But Balzano said she’s dedicated to her Bridgeport school. 
“The students need somebody that they know will stay, because I think they’re so used to a transient teacher and staff population. I think there’s a comfort to know that that teacher or staff member will always be there,” she said. 
Balzano, who only had one other job before working in Bridgeport, said this is “it” for her.
“I can’t really imagine doing anything else, and I just love working with the kids and their families,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0820_SR_SpecialEd_048-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-07 05:57:07.636046

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)As the end of summer approaches the grass in the front yard has gone to seed. The flowery heads sag with the promise of new life and sway like a murmur in the evening breeze. It won’t be long before some city fire department employee comes along in a little white pickup, hops out, and measures the grass with a ruler to find that some patches are above the 8-inch legal maximum.
Then a wooden stake will be pounded into the yard with a cardstock notice written in Sharpie giving me a few days in which to cut the grass or face fines and the threat that the city will cut it for me and bill me for the bother.
But the grass is hardly a nuisance, not yet, so it remains uncut, at least for today. Lawns are also environmental disasters. They limit biodiversity, take too much watering, and are generally made of nonnative grass. They’re also an indicator of class status, a signal that you have the leisure time to care for a lawn or the means to have somebody do it for you. And yes, the grass can be a fire hazard if it’s too tall and close to a building. That’s why the fire department measures it with rulers.
I’m tempted to replace the lawn with native plants.
But there’s been too much activity on Constitution Street in the past month with little time for lawn care or native landscaping. Empty paint cans are piled like empty beer cans on the porch and the tracks from a bucket truck are still visible in the damp yard. My guy doing the painting used the bucket to reach some of the highest peaks of the many gabled roof, part of the design of a house that was built before the phrase “world war” was in our vocabulary. It is an elaborate roof for such a small home, with some of the extant gingerbread between the gables reminding me more of a steamboat than a house. The water has been deep enough in the front yard during the rains of the past month that the old house has seemed like a ship laid up in strange waters. This port of call has been the summer of 2025.
The end of summer always finds me in a reflective mood. There’s just over two weeks left before autumn arrives — it officially begins at 1:19 p.m. Sept. 22 — so I have an urge to get things done. The painting will be finished in a week, if it doesn’t rain too much, but there’s still some carpentry work to do. I’ll tackle that myself, and will be glad to use some of the skills passed down by my father. I’ll leave the plumbing repairs to a professional, although I’ll hear my amateur handyman father whispering behind me that I should be doing it myself. He’s been dead 27 years, but he comes to me in my dreams, never speaking but always with a red metal toolbox and the need to repair something — a car, a door, a water heater.
I know that repairs aren’t really about fixing objects. What my subconscious is manifesting, other than a longing for a dead parent, is a desire to confront challenges, to bring order to chaos, to heal the tribulation of the summer nearly past and the years immediately preceding it.
Sometimes I’ll wake with a start before dawn, my T-shirt soaked with sweat, staring into the darkness and pondering the latest home repair dream. When I can’t get back to sleep, I’ll come downstairs in the quiet house and turn on the lamp behind my writing desk and pull down a volume from the bookshelf. This last episode of unscheduled nocturnal reading happened a couple of nights ago, and the book I reached for was published in 1940. “Rascals in Democracy” was written by W.G. Clugston, a newspaper reporter whose beat was the Kansas Statehouse. While it is ostensibly about politics in the Sunflower State, it’s really about politics everywhere.
Clugston was 50 years old when the book was published and was the kind of reporter Hecht and MacArthur wrote plays about. He was cynical, somebody who saw how the sausage was made, and didn’t shy from telling others the stomach-turning details. He didn’t have much regard for William Allen White, the legendary newspaper editor from Emporia, saying that White could have become a great literary figure if he had not soiled his talents in the “dirty sewer lines of politics.”
Other figures, from Gov. Harry H. Woodring to 1936 presidential hopeful Alf Landon, were similarly dismissed as opportunists. About the only Kansas politician Clugston seemed to like was Arthur Capper, and even then the approval was qualified. Capper, he says, built his publishing empire through classified advertisements in his magazines hawking hoax remedies for impotence to his predominately rural readership.
Clugston was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and graduated with a law degree from the university there. But instead of practicing law he pursued journalism, working for United Press International and the Democratic-leaning Kansas City Post. Once, while covering the Kansas Statehouse for the Post, he was locked in a room and held incommunicado.
At 3:30 a.m. March 17, 1921, officials discovered him hiding in the secretary of state’s office, adjacent to the Senate, while lawmakers met in closed session to debate appointments to a variety of state offices, including bank examiner.
“He was asked (after being hauled before the Senate) to give his promise to refrain from disclosing anything he had heard of the debate on the appointments,” the Wichita Beacon reported. “He refused. As a result he was ordered imprisoned in one of the adjacent committee rooms, where he will remain under the eye of a sergeant-at-arms until the session ends.”
Clugston’s detention lasted until sine die adjournment, 11 hours later.
His first-hand observation of Statehouse politics persuaded him that most politicians were “rascals.” He may have settled on the word because it was a colorful and relatively safe description that did not make an accusation he would have to defend in court.
But Clugston knew how to make a point with humor.
“Scientists have never established, with any degree of accuracy, just how long it takes to produce an outstanding rascal under any form of government,” he wrote. “Nor does history provide much basis for computing the length of time it takes for an individual, or a succession of individuals, to corrupt a state. But Kansas has produced some factual material which might prove useful to statisticians interested in trying to calculate the time elements likely to be involved in such undertakings.”
The ingredients included social snobbery, rampant ambition, the shameless exploitation of family connections, and wrapping oneself in a hypocritical cloak of patriotism and purity. Clugston seems to have envisioned the era of Trump even before our current rascal-in-chief was born.
Clugston believed the long-term fix for the dismal state of politics was education, and for education to be effective teachers had to be liberated from political dogma and be adequately paid. Teachers, he said, were “terrorized” into teaching what benefited the ruling elite instead of spreading enlightenment. Trump? Check.
“The teachers are not to blame for anything except their very human yielding to the urge to keep body and soul together by earning their daily bread through their chosen profession,” Clugston wrote. “But until we really have an educational system that educates, and until the teachers are emancipated and freed from the economic straight-jackets which they are now required to wear, democracy will always be weak in one of its most important understructures.”
Clugston had an unshakeable belief that the people were, if not smarter than their politicians, at least motivated by a desire to express their collective will for good. This seems old-fashioned now, but when “Rascals in Democracy” was released, Britain was already at war with Nazi Germany over the invasion of Poland. The storm clouds were hard to miss, even from across the Atlantic.
This belief in the essential good of the populace was as American as Norman Rockwell, and perhaps as naïve. But Clugston believed in it earnestly, just as he did in a particular form of Christianity, one rooted in civic service. Clugston was also a joiner of things, including a Topeka club founded by Karl Menninger called “The Naked and Unashamed Club.” No, it wasn’t that kind of group. Dedicated to philosophical discussion, the members put their inhibitions aside for open and freewheeling debate.
The book I now hold in my hand is personally signed by Clugston, in the flowing script of a fountain pen. “To my good Irish friend Ed Rooney, whom I love but with whom I can’t agree about anything.” It’s dated June 5, 1940, at Topeka.
Rooney was a Topeka lawyer, a professor at the Washburn University School of Law, and a fellow member of the Naked and Unashamed. In 1942, he and Clugston debated “campaign issues” at Kansas State University at Manhattan, at the invitation of the college’s department of journalism. If there remains a transcript of that debate I would pay cash money for it.
Clugston died in 1963. He was 78. The Associated Press attributed his death to cancer. His literary death, precipitated by a decline in his influence after World War II, was due to neglect. The kind of radicals that flourished in Kansas during the 1920s, including the entire “Appeal to Reason” socialist contingent out of Girard, were crushed by the post-war Red Scare.
If Clugston is remembered at all now, it is as a footnote in a dissertation.
I first came across Clugston years ago while examining some “Little Blue Books” published by Emanuel Haldeman-Julius at the Appeal offices in Girard. Clugston’s “Facts You Should Know About Kansas” came out in 1946.
While I don’t agree with Clugston on everything — his assessment of White was wrong, if only because he was Mary White’s father — I am richer for having read his contrarian view of Kansas politics. There are more things in heaven and Topeka than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
As we near the end of summer, things become clearer on reflection. Our political summer has lasted for some eight decades, a period when those Americans who had fought the rise of fascism endeavored to make a better world using the tools they had. The result wasn’t perfect, especially in an age when a phrase like “world war” was needed, but it was progress.
Now we face a domestic threat to democracy.
One of the tools missing from our citizen toolbox is the ability to have rational and deep debates on the challenges inherent in democracy. Can we recover from a misstep when nobody has yet emerged to galvanize the resistance? How do we engage with our countrymen who reject constitutional democracy in favor of theocracy, oligarchy, or outright dictatorship?
Protest is important. Many thousands have taken to the streets in Topeka and across the county to decry the growing police state and other presidential abuses of power. Their signs and voices express the desire for change. We need protest, but we also need reasoned dissent.
Instead of engaging in informed conversations we hide behind memes, buzzwords, and taunts. So do our politicians. We reject the principled argument in favor of the endorphin rush of manufactured outrage. So do our politicians. This is not righteous outrage, not the kind of outrage over real events that drives movements, but the gossamer constructs of online manipulation.
If there is one lesson I’ve taken from Clugston the forgotten, it’s this:
Thank God for dissent. It is the seed from which democracy grows.
He didn’t say that, but he lived it. And his dissent was informed, insightful, and hurled like a spitball at his targets. He wrote books and signed them to friends who disagreed. He was cranky and colorful and even a bit reckless — can you imagine what the current Kansas Senate would do to a reporter who hid himself to hear a closed-door discussion? — but Clug, as his friends called him, was the genuine article.
This is the kind of thing I ponder when I wake before dawn, with just a couple of weeks of summer left, and reach for an old book on the shelf. In the dreams with my father we never really finish our repairs. The tasks change, but we’re always in the midst of it, using the tools we have. It is the nature of maintenance, whether for a car or a hot water heater or the house of democracy.

Traffic deaths down slightly: On a hopeful note, only 143 highway deaths have been tallied in our state as of mid-August… hopeful, compared to 196 deaths by the same time last year. Credit should go to the state and local police departments for cracking down on reckless drivers and speeders. But of some concern, there’s been an increase in fatalities and injuries involving e-bikes as new laws regarding their operation take effect Oct. 1.
Using A.I. to keep highways safe: It’s been a while since we’ve had a wrong-way crash on our interstates and parkways, thanks in part to artificial intelligence (A.I.). The Connecticut Department of Transportation has installed tech at 150 on- and off-ramps looking for people as they enter the highway in the wrong direction, setting off flashing lights and alerting the State Police.
Higher fares on trains: As predicted, fares on all of our trains went up 5% as of Sept. 1. What a nice way to welcome back commuters! And another 5% jump is coming next July. Bus fares were not affected.
Work from home: Higher rail fares (with the same slow service) and unending traffic are other reasons more than 17% of Connecticut residents chose to work remotely. In some towns the numbers are much higher: 39% of Weston residents and 36% in Westport.
Nextgen Acela: Years late, the nifty new Acela trains started running between Boston and Washington on Aug. 28. Train fan that I am, I saw it run past on it’s debut run… already 12 minutes late. Though they’re capable of 160 mph, they run no faster (and sometimes slower) than Metro-North. Congestion and delays affect even Amtrak’s flagship trainsets. Kind of like putting a Maserati on I-95 at rush hour.
Back in the Metroliner days, Amtrak offered partial fare refunds if your train was 15 minutes late. Last Tuesday’s Next-Gen Acela train (9-2-25) was 30 minutes late into Stamford and 45 minutes late into Washington D.C. If your train is two-plus hours late you have to contact customer relations to plead your case.
Spirit Airlines chapter 11 – take 2: The ultra-low-cost airline has filed for bankruptcy again, just months after emerging from its last filing in 2024. The airline blames financial and operational difficulties: underwhelming demand, excess flight capacity, mounting debt and high operating costs. For now, Spirit plans to continue flying out of Bradley airport.
Shipping BUI: The captain of the 100,000-ton container ship MSC Jubilee IX was arrested last month by the Coast Guard and charged with operating a ship while under the influence. When the Seattle harbor pilot boarded he said he smelled a strong odor of alcohol and called the authorities. The captain said it was just his mouthwash, but a breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol of 0.25, six times the legal limit.
Amazingly, local laws call this only a misdemeanor with a $1,000 fine. But the captain undoubtedly faces severe consequences. The ship continued its journey without him.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wrong-way-driving-hero.jpg,,,2025-09-07 04:56:49.078106
