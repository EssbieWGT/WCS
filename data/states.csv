(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest the recent killing of a women by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.
Renee Nicole Good died on Wednesday after an ICE agent shot her through her car window. Her death, as well as another shooting by federal agents in Portland on Thursday, prompted demonstrations across the country against ICE.
Federal officials have accused Good of attempting to run over an ICE agent ahead of the shooting, but local and national leaders dispute that claim based on videos of the incident.
Good was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.

Activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was recently released after a nine-month detention at an ICE facility in Aurora, addressed the crowd from the steps of the Capitol. Protestors spilled into Lincoln Street between 14th and Colfax avenues and onto the snowy lawn, prompting road closures in the nearby blocks.
“People are ready for a revolution. People are ready to stop ICE,” Vizguerra said, leading chants of “Free them all,” referring to detained immigrants, and encouraging people to protect one another as they continue protests.

The group marched from the Capitol down the 16th Street pedestrian mall towards Union Station. Protestors told Newsline that they thought Good’s death was “criminal” and it felt the federal government is “covering it up” with its insistence that the shooting was in self defense.
Gov. Jared Polis called for an investigation into the shooting in a statement this week.
“What took place in a Minneapolis neighborhood is deeply disturbing, and the loss of Renee Good is tragic. My thoughts are with Renee’s family, especially her young child, friends, and loved ones including those in Colorado,” he said. “The American people deserve answers about what happened.”
More protests and vigils are planned in Colorado for this weekend, including on Sunday at the ICE office in Centennial. The protests follow previous demonstrations in Colorado and across the county over the past year against the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.

Loneliness and love,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/disgraced-welfare-director-takes-stand/,"FILE - John Davis, former director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, leaves the Thad Cochran United States Courthouse in Jackson, Miss., Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022. Mississippi's largest public corruption case, in which tens of millions of dollars earmarked for needy families was misspent, involves a number of sports figures with ties to the sta[...]","Since he was arrested nearly six years ago for diverting millions of federal welfare dollars away from the needy, former Mississippi Department of Human Services director John Davis took the witness stand for the first time Friday.
He is the fourth witness to testify in the trial of a man he said he loved, former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr., who received more than $3 million in welfare funds during Davis’ administration. The testimony was dominated by Davis’ text messages with DiBiase and others, displayed in the courtroom using a projector. 
“There is nothing you could ever do to make me not love you,” read one text from Davis to the wrestler.
The two men even came up with a catchphrase using a combination of their names, “#DaViase4Lyfe,” which they’d sometimes use at the end of their text messages. Like “Bennifer,” the prosecutor noted.
The story told through the texts is one of a bromance with a tragic end. Davis is awaiting federal sentencing for conspiracy and theft and in DiBiase’s trial for conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering, he could face decades if convicted on all 13 counts.

But after six hours of showing Davis text after text, the federal government hadn’t finished with him. And the defense hadn’t taken their turn to question Davis. What the court heard from Davis Friday is an incomplete account from Davis. He is scheduled to return to the stand Monday. 
Still, the prosecution did start to prod at one of the case’s main mysteries: Davis’ motive. 
Davis testified that his introduction to the DiBiase family was through the youngest brother, Brett DiBiase, then a Toshiba salesman who had also been a wrestler. They’d run into each other having lunch one day and Brett DiBiase’s relative, a lobbyist, introduced the men. The agency quickly hired Brett DiBiase and he and the director became “very, very close,” Davis said.
“Were you in love with him?” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie asked.
“I loved him but not ‘in love’ with him if you’re asking the way I think you’re asking,” Davis responded. “I had no sexual desire toward Brett, but I loved him a whole lot.”

Brett DiBiase soon introduced Davis to his brother and his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., another former WWE star who ran an evangelical Christian ministry called Heart of David. Davis exercised unilateral control over the spending of a roughly $1 billion state agency, and they all began working together.
Davis testified that his agency contracted with Heart of David to satisfy a faith-based initiative that then-Gov. Phil Bryant, Davis’ boss, wanted the agency to support.
Around this time, Davis had also begun pushing tens of millions of federal welfare dollars to two nonprofits – Mississippi Community Education Center and Family Resource Center – to run a nebulous statewide anti-poverty initiative called Families First for Mississippi. Meynardie asked if this was part of Republican Bryant’s directive to “privatize” the agency.

“The administration liked to call it consolidation because it sounds better,” Davis said. 
But after the nonprofits received the funding, Davis testified that he often dictated what they did with the money, including giving it to his wrestler friends.
After a while of employing Brett DiBiase, Davis said, “it became really difficult for me to sit on Brett, because he was so high-strung.” 
Brett DiBiase was in recovery from drug addiction when they met, Davis said, but he relapsed. Davis dropped Brett DiBiase as an employee of his agency and helped get him a job at one of the Families First nonprofits instead. The wrestler’s salary jumped from under $100,000 at the state to $250,000 at Mississippi Community Education Center. 
Davis also testified that he accompanied Brett DiBiase on a trip to New Orleans to visit DiBiase’s extramarital girlfriend and twice on runs to meet the wrestler’s drug dealer. The prosecution asked directly if Davis had sexual relations with the younger brother and Davis said he had not. When Brett DiBiase agreed to return to rehab, he went to a luxury treatment facility in Malibu, California, on the nonprofit’s dime.
Had the nonprofits attempted to cut off the spigot to Brett DiBiase, Davis testified he would have tried to talk to them to keep the payments flowing.
“The million dollar question: Why?” Meynardie asked.
This is when Davis explained that he had no spouse, no children and few friends – a hazard, he said, of working at the state agency – and that Brett DiBiase, “he was like, I was going to say a brother, but more like a child.”
Throughout 2017, Davis began turning his attention – and finances – to the older brother, Teddy DiBiase, who lavished Davis with words.
“I don’t have enough room nor adequate words to describe the amazingness that makes up the DNA of your very being,” DiBiase once texted the director in late 2017. “… I don’t know where you came from or what we did to deserve such an honor to do life with you.”
By 2018, they were attending workouts together and moved into a swanky new office with valet parking in downtown Jackson. Together, they cooked up idea after idea. A statewide self-help lecture program. A program for inner-city youth. A feeding program. Something called “Jesse gym.”
If DiBiase could take the concepts he created during his time with the welfare program and make them unique, the two men hoped they could go into business together and sell the product to other states.
“I set (sic) up at night dreaming shit. But remember for us dreams are reality cause with Gods help all things are possible,” Davis once texted DiBiase. The texts were heavy with talk of faith and prayer.
Davis testified that he planned to leave the agency at the end of 2018 and part of his efforts with DiBiase were so there would be something waiting for him in retirement. They even mused about purchasing a property – the “DaViase Farm.”
“You’re talking about generational security?” the prosecutor asked, and Davis confirmed.
The prosecution asked if Davis’ newfound ventures with Teddy DiBiase made his brother jealous. “Yes sir, there was always some tension there,” Davis said.
The discussions weren’t always about grand visions. Sometimes they were about more tangible desires. Davis testified that the day after Teddy DiBiase received a $1 million agreement in May of 2018, the wrestler bought a truck. “That truck looks good with you on it,” Davis texted.
“I LOOOOOOOOVE THIS THING,” DiBiase responded. “And I love you John Davis more.”
But all while Davis was ensuring Teddy DiBiase in text messages of future grant funding “that will provide you with a level of security that I promised you,” he at times sang a different tune with the nonprofit directors.
“It bothers me that I allowed these guys to gain access and it feels like they are using,” Davis texted the Families First nonprofit directors. He was referring to DiBiase and friends of the wrestler that Davis had also allowed to the welfare trough. 
In another text, Davis wrote, “It’s frustrating how these people think they are so talented they need big money and then don’t do anything.”
At one point, Davis said he surmised that the nonprofit directors were hesitant about cutting off funding for DiBiase’s friend, who was not performing under his contract, because they thought doing so would upset Davis. The director wanted to assure them he was on the side of accountability. 
“There are no sacred cows for me,” Davis texted.
“But there were two sacred cows, weren’t there?” Meynardie asked Davis Friday.
Davis replied: “There were.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09172609/AP22276452381257.jpg,,,2026-01-09 22:56:43.686130

Bob Ferguson speaks to reporters during the annual legislative session preview in Olympia, Wash., on Jan. 9, 2026. (Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson likely violated state laws by allowing his former top adviser, Mike Webb, to travel with him on a state plane to the Tri-Cities last summer, the state Executive Ethics Board ruled Friday.
In a unanimous vote, the board concluded there was “reasonable cause” to believe Ferguson ran afoul of Washington’s ethics laws by using state resources for the private benefit of a non-state employee.
Ferguson provided “a special privilege” to Webb by allowing him to travel on the Washington State Patrol aircraft, wrote agency executive director Kate Reynolds in her recommendation to the board.
Under the statute, the board will hold a hearing at which the governor can contest the charges either in person or through written testimony. The board will then decide whether a violation occurred and a penalty or other enforcement action is required.
A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond for comment.
Ferguson told the ethics board investigators last year that use of state resources was “de minimis in nature” and not for private gain, and he asked for the matter to be dismissed.

The Executive Ethics Board received a complaint July 30, 2025 alleging that the governor violated provisions of the Ethics in Public Service Act by letting Webb travel with him to the Tri-Cities. The June 26 trip, which included official business and a political fundraiser, was first reported by Axios.
Webb, Ferguson’s longtime friend and closest political confidant, served as the governor’s chief strategy officer until resigning in March amid complaints that he fomented a hostile workplace. 
In a staff meeting in mid-July, Ferguson addressed the trip, apologized and called his decision to let Webb fly on the plane “pretty stupid.”
In a written response, Ferguson also told the board’s investigators that, “Allowing an individual to travel as a guest neither interfered with official duties nor provided that individual with any improper advantage derived from state office.” 
“The flight in question was not at capacity,” Ferguson wrote. “The individual’s presence did not displace any state employee. It did not create additional cost in terms of fuel, staffing, or time. The state incurred no financial burden or misuse of taxpayer resources.”
Webb told The Seattle Times last year he sat on a seat over the plane’s toilet.
The travel “imposed no cost, no operational burden, and no impact on state functions,” he added. “Incidental or negligible use that does not result in added expense or harm to the public interest does not rise to the level of an ethics violation.”
The Washington State Patrol told investigators that aircraft costs are calculated on a per-flight-hour basis. If multiple agencies are using the plane, the tab is divided evenly by the number of passengers, and each passenger, or their agency, is billed for their share.
For the June 26 trip, the aircraft was only used by the governor’s office, so the aircraft cost was billed per flight hour. The report did not list the actual charge.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little has appointed Erin Bingham to the seat vacated by former Joint Finance-Appropriations co-chairwoman Wendy Horman.
Bingham is the chief financial officer of Bingham Ventures, “a family-operated development organization, where she supports their financial management and the company’s commitment to community-minded development,” according to a press release from the governor’s office.
State Rep. Wendy Horman, co-chair of budget committee, to resign from Idaho Legislature

Horman, an experienced and powerful state legislator who has served as one of the architects of the state budget, announced Dec. 19 that she would resign from the Idaho Legislature to accept a position with the federal government in Washington, D.C. Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, was named as her replacement as co-chair of the Legislature’s budget committee on Monday.
Bingham and her husband, Val, have four children and reside in Idaho Falls, according to the release.
“Bingham is an active member of the Idaho Falls community, staying engaged over the years by volunteering at her children’s schools and serving in leadership roles through parent-teacher organizations and neighborhood groups,” the release said.
In the press release, Bingham said she was honored to represent the eastern Idaho legislative district.
“I sincerely appreciate Representative Wendy Horman for her years of commitment to our state and look forward to building on her legacy of service,” she said in the release. “I am thankful for this incredible opportunity and am excited to get to work.”
Bingham will serve the remainder of Horman’s term, which ends Nov. 30, 2026. All 105 legislative seats are up for re-election for two-year terms this year.
When there is a vacancy in the Legislature, Idaho Code states that the political party of the lawmaker who vacated the position will submit a list of three names to the governor for consideration.
“Bonneville County Republicans submitted a list of names to Governor Little for appointment, consistent with Idaho law,” the press release said.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)Attorney General Alan Wilson announced Friday picking state Sen. Mike Reichenbach as his running mate, becoming the first of seven candidates for governor to complete his campaign ticket.
The pair will first campaign together at a meet-and-greet event Monday evening in Florence.
Reichenbach, 54, brings a business background to the ticket and diversity to the governor’s race, both as the field’s lone Black Republican and only person from the Pee Dee.
In picking Reichenbach, Wilson also chose someone with a compelling personal story who’s still relatively new to politics. The car dealership owner was first elected to the Senate in March 2022 to fill the unexpired term of the late Senate Finance Chairman Hugh Leatherman following his death at age 90.
Four years after Reichenbach successfully campaigned as a “political outsider” for the seat Leatherman held for 41 years, he’s still been in elected office less than any of the Republicans running for governor. Wilson has been the state’s chief prosecutor since 2010.
While his announcement is a first for the race, it’s been in the works for months.
Reichenbach told the SC Daily Gazette that Wilson approached him last summer about joining his ticket. He didn’t specify when, but that means it was early into Wilson’s own campaign, which he officially launched last June.
Reichenbach said he was honored but needed to think about it. He eventually decided his experiences, particularly as a business owner, could help South Carolinians.
He recounted his early days in business during the Great Recession.
“I know what it’s like to lay awake at night and be unsure if you could make payroll and to have to lay employees off and to have to struggle as a small business,” he said. “I fight for small businesses because I am one.”
The lieutenant governor’s job is considered part-time. The job duties are largely whatever the person in the governor’s office decides.
The role used to include presiding over the Senate and overseeing the Office on Aging. But those responsibilities were taken away by the constitutional change approved by voters in 2012 to take the post off the ballot as a separately elected office.
That change didn’t take effect until the 2018 governor’s race, when Gov. Henry McMaster’s running mate, Pam Evette, became the first lieutenant governor in state history to be elected as part of a joint ticket.
Eight years later, Evette is among the four other Republicans and two Democrats running for governor who have yet to publicly pick their choice for lieutenant governor. The primaries are still five months away.
Reichenbach, a father of two, said he hoped to use the job as a metaphorical megaphone to advocate for issues that are deeply personal for him.
That includes making adoptions easier and more affordable and helping youth in foster care avoid prison time.
Like Wilson, the adopted son of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, Reichenbach was adopted as a child. During an abortion debate in 2023, he offered the most heartfelt explanation for supporting the six-week ban that took effect later that year.
His mother was 14 in 1971 when she became pregnant by her 15-year-old boyfriend, he said on the Senate floor, adding he’s here because she put him up for adoption.
On Friday, Reichenbach said he wants to take care of all families, not just “the typical Norman Rockwall perfect family.”
“We do have a bond,” Reichenbach said of Wilson. “We both feel passionately that we need to work to make the family unit stronger, but we also need to have a special focus on those that have no or have a little voice — those 3,300 children in foster care, that was me at one point. That could have been him at one point.”
The other Republicans campaigning for the Governor’s Mansion are U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace of Charleston County and Ralph Norman of Rock Hill, and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid stalled state negotiations over how to share the Colorado River’s dwindling water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation on Friday released a range of options that will serve as the foundation for how to manage the river’s largest reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
The highly anticipated 1,600-page document details five alternative proposals that will guide new water management rules to replace the current ones set to expire in August 2026. The proposals primarily focus on the operation of Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam and Lake Powell’s Glen Canyon Dam.
The seven states that share the river’s flows have been deadlocked for nearly two years over how to govern the waterway through the coming decades — even as water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are forecasted to reach record lows after two straight years of disappointing snowpack across the West.
The alternatives include a compliance option that could be implementable in 2027 if states can’t reach a seven-state agreement on how to share the river’s water supply, however under that alternative Nevada, Arizona, and California would face water shortages up to 1.48 million acre-feet.
“The Department of the Interior is moving forward with this process to ensure environmental compliance is in place so operations can continue without interruption when the current guidelines expire,” Andrea Travnicek, the department’s assistant secretary for water and science, said in a news release Friday. “The river and the 40 million people who depend on it cannot wait. In the face of an ongoing severe drought, inaction is not an option.”
Any guidelines adopted for post-2026 Colorado River operations are likely to face an early test with forecasts anticipating low elevations at Lake Powell and Lake Mead in 2027. Lakes Powell and Mead are currently less than two-thirds full, while projections show the river’s inflow next year is likely to be 27% lower than normal.
Without a strong winter snow season, it’s possible Lake Powell’s levels could drop low enough to cease hydropower production by next October — a scenario that would also limit the department’s ability to send water downstream to Nevada, Arizona, and California.
Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules are required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.
The proposals released Friday were part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, which includes a Draft Environmental Impact Statement analyzing the impacts of the proposals. 
Several river negotiators said they have not yet reviewed the lengthy document published late Friday, and could not give a detailed analysis of the proposals.
“We are reviewing the draft EIS, and we expect to be in a position to provide comments next week. We’d like to give a thorough review before we comment,” said Bronson Mack, a spokesperson for Nevada’s chief river negotiator and general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority John Entsminger.
Utah’s chief river negotiator Gene Shawcroft echoed those comments.
“The Authority will take the time necessary to fully evaluate the document before offering detailed comments,” Shawcroft said in a statement.
Shawcroft called the release of the draft environmental impact statement for post-2026 Colorado River operations “an important milestone in a complex and consequential process.”
“The Authority looks forward to carefully reviewing the draft and continuing to work with our Basin State partners, water users, Tribes, and the Bureau of Reclamation to help ensure future operations protect Utah water users, support the environment, and reflect Utah’s priorities,” he continued.
In an unusual move, the draft environmental impact statement did not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer. A preferred alternative is typically included in environmental reviews. 
“Given the importance of a consensus-based approach to operations for the stability of the system, Reclamation has not yet identified a preferred alternative,” said Acting Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Scott Cameron in a statement Friday.
However, the draft environmental review does include a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply.
“Reclamation anticipates that when an agreement is reached, it will incorporate elements or variations of these five alternatives and will be fully analyzed in the Final EIS enabling the sustainable and effective management of the Colorado River,” Cameron said.
States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer,  with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
States along the Colorado River have been split into two camps for months over how to manage the river after 2026: Arizona, California, and Nevada in the Lower Basin; and Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming in the Upper Basin.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.
The public comment period on the post-2026 alternatives runs from Jan. 16 to March 2. The federal agency will also host two virtual meetings to share more details on the draft, scheduled for Jan. 29 and Feb. 10.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/091925_S-Utah-Stock_03-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 20:12:10.409715

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The head of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration said the state won’t pay the lawyer hired by the corrections board to represent it in lawsuits against the governor.
Jim Hudson said in a letter Tuesday to the Department of Corrections that paying attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan $300,000 would violate state law and Arkansas’ constitution, saying that the board did not follow state procurement procedures.
The rejection is the latest setback for the Board of Corrections which has been embroiled in a legal fight for over two years with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over who controls the state’s prison system. Disputes over how and whether to pay Mehdizadegan has been part of litigation that’s spawned from that power struggle.
Hudson’s rationale for denying the payment is similar to arguments Attorney General Tim Griffin has made in court — the board did not follow state law when it hired the outside lawyer, his letter said.
“The Board is obligated to follow state procurement law just as any other agency governed by constitutional provisions are so obligated,” Hudson wrote, citing the state Game and Fish Commission and higher education institutions as examples. “DFA cannot pay invoices for services that were not lawfully procured.”
Mehdizadegan and a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
The fight over control of the prison system began in 2023 when the panel fired Sanders’ pick for Corrections Secretary, Joe Profiri. When Profiri asserted that only Sanders could fire him due to changes in state law, the board — which is created by the constitution, not state law — hired Mehdizadegan and sued.
The board has argued that the changes Sanders signed into law violated Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution by shifting oversight of the corrections system from it to the governor. A state judge last year agreed, finding those laws unconstitutional.
Mehdizadegan’s hire quickly became its own legal battle when Griffin sued over it, saying board members violated procurement  law and the Freedom of Information Act they hired Mehdizadegan.
Court rulings last year appeared to clear the way for the board to pay the attorney. 
In his letter this week, Hudson also wrote the Department of Corrections does not have funds appropriated to cover the bill. Under the state’s constitution, paying those invoices would require legislative approval. 
The denial came after multiple communications from board member Lee Watson — who, as an attorney himself, also acts as the board’s legal liaison — to Hudson in the weeks after a Dec. 16 meeting where the board voted a second time to pay Mehdizadegan, after department staff raised concerns that the state would not pay the invoices.
Hudson also wrote that the laws the board sued over were not factors in whether the bills could be paid.

(Bob Wick photo/Bureau of Land Management)The state of Alaska is preparing to give away millions of dollars worth of gravel to public corporations, a move that would amount to millions of dollars in assistance to some of the state’s biggest construction projects.
According to a Q&A posted by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, the beneficiaries could include the proposed Ambler Access Project and the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
The state’s plans were disclosed the day before Thanksgiving in a public notice stating that DNR is planning “regulation changes on material sales and conveyances to state agencies.”
The Department of Natural Resources oversees mining on state lands in Alaska, including the extraction of gravel and fill dirt for use in construction.
While humble, gravel can be serious business — in November, DNR commissioner-designee John Crowther signed an order that prohibits gold, silver and other kinds of mining near gravel quarries along the Dalton Highway, which links Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay. 
For state maintenance crews that need to keep the highway open, gravel is more important than rare minerals.
In 2024, High Country News reported that for construction projects on the North Slope, gravel is a “precious commodity” because of its scarcity. 
One of DNR’s proposed changes to its gravel rules declares “that the department convey material to a state agency or public corporation at a base price of $0.00 per cubic yard and without retaining a reversionary interest.”
Currently posted price charts show the state selling gravel for $3 per cubic yard in Interior Alaska. 
State law prescribes that any time DNR wants to sell land or public resources for less than market value, the commissioner must declare that the sales “serve a public purpose and are in the public interest.”
The upcoming regulation change states that transfer to a state agency or state corporation is automatically consistent with that requirement.
That would allow the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities to get gravel from state land for free, excepting the cost of processing and transportation. 
In a question and answer notice published Dec. 26, DNR said the change is intended to allow “for maximum use of state land consistent with the public interest.”
“Examples of a public purpose would be a state agency or public corporation using gravel to construct a gravel pad on a state leased site for infrastructure development; to construct a new state highway right-of-way or expand an existing state right-of-way; or to build an embankment along a river; or gravel needed for the development of a gas line right-of-way,” it wrote.
The free gravel and dirt would also be available to state-owned corporations, which is likely to affect some of the state’s biggest development projects.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority is developing a 211-mile road between the Dalton Highway and mine sites in northwest Alaska and would be eligible for the free rock and dirt. So would the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., which is now a junior partner in the development of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. 
A spokesperson for Glenfarne, the pipeline’s lead developer, said the firm did not request the regulation change.
In 2024, the Bureau of Land Management estimated that the proposed Ambler Road would need between 15 million and 22 million cubic yards of gravel, plus an additional 220,000 to 347,000 yards annually for maintenance.
If the state of Alaska provides that gravel for free, it would be a revenue loss of between $45 million and $66 million for construction alone. 
The public comment period on the change expired on Jan. 2, and it was not immediately clear when the change would take effect.
Lorraine Henry, director of communications for DNR, said by email that it isn’t yet clear how much gravel might be affected by the regulation change, and that the agency didn’t intend to benefit any specific project.
“DNR cannot speculate on the volume of gravel that may be involved, as each application from State of Alaska agencies will be evaluated on its merits – and will include a public process and follow statutory authorities,” she said.

Legislative Bill 938, the First-Time Homeowner Savings Account Act, was introduced Friday by State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse on behalf of State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg. Spellerberg took the reins of treasury in November after Tom Briese resigned.
Similar first-time homebuyer legislation was introduced last session by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. Spellerberg’s staff said it was not aware of the Cavanaugh bill when the treasurer was examining models tried in other states. Staff said LB 938 was not meant to be competing legislation, but a vehicle to address one of the largest challenges facing Nebraskans. 
While similar to Cavanaugh’s LB 151, the new proposal allows for higher savings amounts. Under LB 938, eligible individuals could contribute up to $5,000 a year and couples up to $10,000. Contributions would be deductible from adjusted gross income in Nebraska, and earnings from the savings account would be exempt from state income tax when used for homebuying expenses.

Total contributions would be capped at $50,000 for married couples and $25,000 for individuals. Impacts on the state budget would start in 2027, when the bill would go into effect.
Cavanaugh said he was “thrilled” to know others agree with the merits of the homeowner savings account and hopes it’s a sign the idea will advance this session.
Spellerberg, the 35-year-old former mayor of Fremont, said inflation and higher interest rates have made the dream of homeownership “harder than it should be, especially for young families and young professionals.”
Housing is consistently discussed as a top concern and impediment to growth, he said.
 “As the state’s chief financial officer, I believe LB 938 will help more Nebraskans own a home and do it in a financially responsible way.”

Juneau over the downtown area Jan. 9, 2026. City officials issued an evacuation advisory Friday morning. (Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s capital city advised downtown residents in avalanche zones to evacuate their homes late Friday morning. Avalanche risk mounted as a result of increased snowfall, higher temperatures and forecasted rain, triggering an emergency alert. 
City and Borough of Juneau Emergency Programs Manager Ryan O’Shaughnessy said the city is monitoring the risk closely and working with the National Weather Service and the state’s Department of Transportation.
“If you live in a slide path it’s time to grab your go bag and get out of your house and make other arrangements until the hazard has cleared,” he said at a news conference on Zoom that began late Friday morning.
O’Shaughnessy pointed residents to an interactive map of avalanche zones in downtown Juneau. Residents can type in their addresses to see if they are in a risk zone. He said the avalanche zone depicted in the maps includes what are called runout zones, where snow would spread after an avalanche.
 
Screenshot from the City and Borough of Juneau’s avalanche maps.
“This is not a decision that we made lightly,” O’Shaughnessy said of the evacuation advisory. “We’ve been monitoring the current conditions… and we’ve come to this decision to ultimately protect life and safety.”
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened Centennial Hall as a shelter for displaced residents. O’Shaughnessy said the shelter will also accept people whose residences do not fall in the evacuation zone if they feel they are in danger. He said the evacuation notice could last several days depending on weather conditions.
Juneau has endured record breaking cold and snowfall this winter. NWS recorded 82 inches of snow at the Juneau airport in December and another 9 inches this month. The average for an entire winter season in Juneau is 87 inches of snow, NWS meteorologist Nicole Ferrin said.
NWS reported 3-7 inches of snow overnight on Thursday and a transition to moderate to heavy rain on Friday. Ferrin said the agency expects the heaviest rain on Friday afternoon and evening, which should taper on Saturday.
In addition to avalanche risk, there is a flood watch in effect in Juneau for localized flooding and ponding of water on roadways.

“If you’re not sure how deep the water is across a roadway or otherwise, or if you don’t know if your vehicle can make it through, then find an alternate route,” Ferrin said on Friday. “If your tailpipe is reaching the level of the water, then you could easily get stuck and cause more issues there.”
State transportation officials closed the only road to the Thane neighborhood at noon on Friday due to high avalanche risk in the Mt. Roberts slide zone. Capitol transit has limited bus service and is not servicing stops on Glacier Highway due to avalanche risk in that area.
The City and Borough of Juneau and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska issued a joint disaster declaration on Tuesday that was followed by a verbal state disaster declaration from Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The news comes less than two weeks before the beginning of the legislative session in Juneau. The Capitol Building is not in an avalanche zone, but the governor closed all executive offices on Friday afternoon, according to Sante Lesh, the director of the state’s Legislative Affairs Agency.
Jeff Turner, a spokesperson for the Dunleavy administration, said state buildings are in “good shape,” but employees were asked to go home early on Friday at 1:00 p.m.
U.S. Coast Guard Sector Southeast Alaska has crews on standby to support Capital City Fire/Rescue and provide waterside transport in the event that it is needed to bypass high risk areas on the road system, Coast Guard Captain Stanley Fields said on Friday at a news conference with the city.
Juneau schools are closed Friday in anticipation of heavy snow and rain; the University of Alaska Southeast is operating remotely.
“This is a tough one,” O’Shaughnessy said at the Friday news conference. “This storm has impacted every aspect of all of our lives, both personally and professionally. I think everyone is tired. I know I’ve shoveled roofs and my driveway more times than I can count. But I want to stress that we are not out of the woods, and there are still significant hazards that remain for the public.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Opportunity Caucus said its bank statements offer “evidence for complete vindication” of allegations that Democratic state legislators broke the state’s law prohibiting elected officials from receiving gifts. 
Colorado Common Cause, a pro-democracy organization, filed complaints with the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission against members of the caucus alleging they accepted payment from a pro-business dark money group, One Main Street, for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. The gathering was first reported by The Colorado Sun. 
Caucus leaders allegedly asked One Main Street to pay a $25,000 bill for legislators’ hotel expenses while at the Vail retreat. Email screenshots included in the complaints filed by Common Cause show One Main Street Executive Director Andrew Short asking for “an urgent, out-of-cycle approval for a $25,000 expenditure to secure hotel rooms for the Colorado Opportunity Caucus Summit.”

The complaints should be dismissed because the caucus had enough money on hand to cover all of its expenses from the Vail retreat before One Main Street made its donation, according to the response filed Thursday on behalf of Sen. Lindsey Daugherty of Arvada, who chairs the caucus. Daugherty said “the entire basis for the complaint is factually false” and encouraged Common Cause to dismiss the complaints. 
“The truth is that the Caucus could and did pay the hotel bill without using this (One Main Street) donation,” the response says. “In fact, the amount attributed to (One Main Street) as set forth in the complaint was donated to a local food bank and was never used for any Caucus purpose, let alone for the retreat. Therefore, because the causal link needed to prove an ethical violation is missing, this complaint must be dismissed.”
The response characterized the Vail trip as an “organization and educational retreat” for caucus members. 
Gift ban approved in 2006
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, said the responses fail to address the emails from One Main Street leadership that led to Common Cause filing the complaints. 
“Nothing the Opportunity Caucus put forward in their filing or their press statements change the underlying facts of the case,” Belknap said. “We continue to have full confidence in the substance of our ethics complaints and we know that the Independent Ethics Commission has taken a close look and says our ethics complaints have merit.”
Recht Kornfeld PC filed responses on behalf of 15 legislators who face allegations. Sen. Kyle Mullica of Thornton opted not to be represented by the law firm representing other legislators, according to a spokesperson for the caucus. 
Other accused legislators include Rep. Tisha Mauro of Pueblo, Rep. Michael Carter of Aurora, Rep. Jacque Phillips of Thornton, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Rep. Meghan Lukens of Steamboat Springs, Rep. Karen McCormick of Longmont, Rep. Cecelia Espenoza of Denver, Rep. Matthew Martinez of Monte Vista, Rep. Katie Stewart of Durango, Rep. Sean Camacho of Denver, Sen. William Lindstedt of Broomfield, Sen. Marc Snyder of Manitou Springs, Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City and Sen. Judy Amabile of Boulder. 
A complaint filed against former Rep. Shannon Bird of Westminster was dismissed because she did not attend the retreat in question. 
The Independent Ethics Commission moved the complaints forward in its review process in November. 
Colorado voters in 2006 approved a gift ban for elected officials. 
“Transparency is the point of the work that we do, and ethics enforcement only works if it’s done in the light of day,” Belknap said. “We believe in the system that Colorado voters and lawmakers created when we passed Amendment 41 to establish this gift ban.” 
Commissioners will review the responses filed by the legislators at its Jan. 20 meeting, and an investigation into the allegations will follow, according to Dino Ioannides, executive director of the commission.

Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative bill introduced Friday would make the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission an elected office. Another bill would protect physicians who want to recommend the medicine.
Both bills, from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, come after a yearlong, continued fight to implement a medical cannabis system that voters approved in the 2024 general election. Voters legalized up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
Voters also created a regulatory, governor-appointed Medical Cannabis Commission with “exclusive” authority to regulate the drug. Under the law, three members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission automatically serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission.

Commissioners Robert “Bud” Synhorst of Lincoln and James Elworth of Nebraska City were appointed to the commission in November. Oct. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Cavanaugh, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, said making the commission an elected office would instill direct accountability to voters who have “clearly expressed their desire to have a well-regulated, functioning medical cannabis system.”
That’s a desire Cavanaugh said Gov. Jim Pillen and his appointees have “definitely frustrated.”
“The voters deserve to have more input,” Cavanaugh said. “I think it’s clear the voters want this, and this is giving an opportunity to have a board that is directly accountable to the people and will be more reflective.”
Legislative Bill 934 would require the five commissioners to be elected statewide beginning in 2028 for four-year terms. District lines would follow those of the five-member Public Service Commission. Two commissioners would run again in 2030 so future terms would be staggered. 
The commission would continue to operate as-is through Jan. 4, 2029.
Cavanaugh also introduced LB 933 with State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. It would protect health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to patients from any criminal, civil and disciplinary action solely for recommending the medicine. 
The Omaha senator made a similar last-minute attempt to pass protections in May 2025, which procedurally fell flat. A more comprehensive legislative framework for medical cannabis, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, also failed to advance.
Many Nebraskans have said their in-state physicians have been unwilling to issue recommendations. The commission is writing regulations that would allow legal in-state sales.
Said Cavanaugh: “I’m trying to eliminate the fear of retribution from people like the attorney general who are specifically taking action to have a chilling effect on professional judgment.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN — A financial advisor who helped Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks swindle $45 million from nearly 20 banks and savings and loans was ordered Friday to pay them more than $37 million in restitution.
While it’s doubtful that Jesse Hill, a Hickman financial advisor, will ever come close to paying off the financial institutions, the order gives a final rendering of how much money is still owed on fraudulent loans used to cover catastrophic investment losses and to purchase a villa in Costa Rica and a turboprop airplane.
This is what the Marshbanks mansion, now called “The Plainsman,” looked like in November as new owners began the work of completing the construction of the unfinished luxury home. (Screenshot from the Lancaster County Assessor’s Office website)
The scam, first reported by the Nebraska Examiner, has been described as possibly the largest case of bank fraud in Nebraska history.
Hill, officials have said, would accompany Marshbanks, a real estate investor, when making loan applications, providing falsified documents that showed plenty of collateral in investment accounts.
Hill was not present in the courtroom Friday when U.S. District Judge Susan Bazis issued her restitution order. He has already begun serving a five-year prison sentence.
Friday’s 10-minute hearing was in stark contrast to the October sentencing, when members of Hill’s evangelical church packed a large courtroom in the federal building in Lincoln in hopes that Hill would receive a more lenient prison sentence.
Only a handful of federal probation employees and FBI agents were present Friday when the restitution order was given. Hill’s wife, Tabitha, quietly watched the proceedings via a video connection.
The decision likely means that the Hill family’s luxury home and acreage near Hickman, valued at $1.2 million, will have to be sold to help satisfy the funds still owed to the victims after some assets were recovered.
News of the fraudulent loans became publicly known after Marshbanks, a former school board member and star athlete at Lincoln Christian High School, was found dead in his car in a downtown Lincoln parking garage in November 2022 after overdosing on several drugs.
Shortly after that, the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance went to court to block Hill from selling more investments and to freeze certain assets.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Federal prosecutors have said that all told, Marshbanks and Hill obtained $45 million in fraudulent loans from financial institutions in Nebraska and Iowa, of which $37.14 million is still owed after some assets were sold.
This summer, Hill, then 35, agreed to accept a plea deal, admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in exchange for the dismissal of other federal charges.
At his sentencing hearing in October, Hill admitted that he didn’t “have the courage” to “challenge” Marshbanks as the scam continued.
An unfinished “barndominium’ (at right) and huge backyard pond are also part of the complex that was being built by Marshbanks (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Marshbanks, according to Hill, began to deteriorate, evolving from a devout family man to someone who spent more time away from home, working out, mixing pain relievers with protein shakes and seeking more and more loans to cover what investigators termed catastrophic investment losses in 2022.
Some of the ill-gotten bank loans were used by Marshbanks to finance construction of a luxury home and barndominium on an acreage he purchased on the eastern edge of Lincoln.
As for Hill, Friday’s restitution order means he will likely have to sell a $1.2 million acreage and 3,000-square-foot home where his family lived near Hickman. Also ordered to be sold were the villa in Costa Rica and a multi-million-dollar Pilatus turboprop airplane he and Marshbanks co-owned.
According a U.S. Department of Justice website, such restitution is rarely paid fully, in part because such repayment to victims of crime can total millions and because the person ordered to pay often has no funds or ability to pay.
Hill had been working construction jobs prior to beginning his prison sentence last month.
Judge Bazis ordered that once Hill pay, once released from prison, $100 a month, or 5% of his gross wages, to pay off the restitution order. At $1,200 a year, it would take him more than 30,000 years to fully pay the restitution.
On a separate legal track, a receiver is still searching for available assets owned by the Marshbanks estate to pay back the banks.
One remaining question is whether a life insurance policy, in excess of $3 million, will go to reimburse the financial institutions or to Marshbanks’ widow and children. A trial in that case is expected this year.
Here’s what each bank is owed via the restitution order, per the judge:

Access Bank, $1.6 million
Columbus Bank and Trust, $2.7 million
Charter West Bank, $2.4 millon
First Nebraska Bank, $3.2 million
 Home Federal Savings and Loan, $2.9 million
I3 Bank, $2.7 million

Beau Ballard of Lincoln and Margo Juarez of Omaha meet on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. Jan. 9, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are set to consider a slew of nationally relevant topics in the 2026 legislative session, including new bills addressing immigration enforcement, homeless encampments and artificial intelligence.
More than 100 new bills were introduced Thursday and Friday. That brings the total number of new bills, resolutions and constitutional amendments introduced over the first three days of a shorter, 60-day session to 250. Legislation can be introduced through the 10th legislative day: Jan. 21.
Immigration enforcement

Legislative Bill 907 from State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, would prohibit law enforcement officers from entering “community safe spaces” to enforce immigration law. Such spaces include a range of public properties, including hospitals, schools, libraries, churches, shelters and courthouses. 
Juarez said she brought the bill because she is “appalled” that the Trump administration has allowed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to go “everywhere.” She said she views it as a violation that impacts both the people ICE is targeting and other members of the public visiting the same spaces. 
“I don’t like the creation of that precedent,” Juarez said. 
Juarez also introduced LB 906, which would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings, masks or disguises and require them to wear identification. State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha brought a similar bill — LB 854. Juarez said she didn’t talk to Hunt about the issue beforehand.  
Juarez’s bill is a bit more expansive than Hunt’s. It specifies that any evidence collected by an officer in violation of the new law would be inadmissible in court. She said there are legitimate safety reasons for officers to wear face coverings but argued it shouldn’t become the norm. 
“Bank robbers cover their faces, not law enforcement,” Juarez said.
Homeless encampments
State Sen. Bob Andersen of Omaha. (Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)
LB 925, from State Sen. Bob Andersen of Omaha, would outlaw unauthorized encampments on any public property or right-of-way, unless the land is designated as a campsite or temporary site for an unsanctioned homeless encampment. State law already prohibits unauthorized encampments on state and county property, Andersen said.
The “Safe Parks and Public Spaces Act” came about, Andersen said, because of some residential area encampments where residents had seen unlawful behavior, such as drug use. 
“It is threatening and makes it unsafe for the resident,” Andersen said.
Violations of the new law would be a Class V misdemeanor, but, for first-time offenders, law enforcement would direct them to the nearest appropriate shelter for homeless individuals. 
Political subdivisions would be prohibited from allowing anyone to regularly camp or sleep on such property or rights-of-way and could not prohibit or discourage enforcement. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services would oversee any alleged violations.

LB 939, from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, would require age verification for chatbots on online platforms and require online platforms to identify when chatbots use artificial intelligence and prevent such chatbots from impersonating a human while interacting with a minor. 
Chatbots are often operated by artificial intelligence software and apps, including X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Murman said some of these services have been linked to youth suicides, and he hopes to mitigate those risks by increasing transparency. 
“I don’t want to overly regulate AI at all,” Murman said. “AI has a bright future.” 
Murman said LB 939 is similar to a previous bill he passed in 2024, LB 1092, which required online porn companies to verify users’ ages. As a result of the law, Pornhub went dark in Nebraska, where it remains to this day. 
It is unclear how an executive order President Donald Trump signed in December seeking to stop states from regulating artificial intelligence might impact LB 939. The order does include a carveout for protecting minors.

Other legislation
Among other notable bills introduced this week: 

LB 837, by State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte — Allow cash transactions and wages in the state to be rounded up or down to the nearest nickel with the national elimination of pennies. Transactions ending in one, two, six or seven cents could be rounded down, while transactions ending in three, four, eight or nine to be rounded up. Digital payments, gift cards, checks and money orders would not be affected.
LB 843, by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue — Require the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to file a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program waiver for refugees and immigrants. 
LB 848, by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, and LB 865, by State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln — Create three-day sales tax holidays before the start of fall school semesters. Cavanaugh’s LB 848 would begin at 12:01 a.m. the first Friday of August for clothing, school supplies, computer software, graphing calculators and personal computers up to certain dollar amounts. Prokop’s LB 865 would begin at 12:01 a.m. the last Friday of July for child care supplies, clothing, footwear and school supplies up to certain dollar amounts. The state sales tax is 5.5 cents per $1, most local rates are up to 2 cents.
LB 849, also by Cavanaugh — Exempt over-the-counter drugs from sales taxes.
LB 881, by State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha — Require law enforcement agencies, jails and the Nebraska State Patrol to receive approval from a “local governing body” before entering agreements to enforce immigration law. This follows controversies over Nebraska entering an agreement with the federal government over transferring the McCook Work Ethic Camp to ICE and local decisions by county sheriffs and county jails to help ICE. 
LB 910, by State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering — Require individuals convicted of sexual offenses against children to pay a fee for electronic devices seized during prosecution. 
LB 913, also by Hardin — Requie DHHS to appoint a dementia services coordinator who would serve as a central point to collect data on Alzheimer’s and dementia, evaluate needs and link families caring for individuals facing those diagnoses with resources.
LB 915, by State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City — Allow one additional Inland Port Authority district, for a total of six. The five current ones are in Omaha, Bellevue, South Sioux City, Lincoln County and Fremont/Dodge County. Districts require approval from a host city or county and are intended to help spur economic development.
LB 940, by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil — Prohibit certain artificial color additives in meals served at public K-12 schools. The banned additives would include Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6.

The maternity ward at the Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden closed after hospital administrators concluded that keeping it open “was no longer feasible,” hospital CEO Glenda Harper said Friday afternoon. Harper said last year that the ward “does not make money at this point.”
The decision to close the ward exacerbates the challenges for patients and providers in a region where places to give birth were already scarce. Paramedics have seen an uptick in the number of deliveries being performed in ambulances.
Harper has been CEO of the hospital since August and hoped to keep the labor and delivery unit open despite it losing money every month, she said.
Arkansas’ maternity ward shortage sometimes leads to births in ambulances, paramedics say

However, the unit only delivered 119 babies last year, falling short of the goal of delivering 200 babies per year in order to justify keeping it open, Harper said. The hospital rarely exceeded 200 births per year since 2015, and it also struggled to retain obstetric nurses, she said.
The unit’s closure “reflects the immense challenge hospitals face when reimbursement rates from all payors do not keep pace with the rising costs of providing care,” the Arkansas Hospital Association said in a statement Friday.
The Ouachita County Medical Center closed its intensive care unit in late 2025 for similar reasons: low patient volume and difficulty staffing the department, Harper said.
The closest hospitals with labor and delivery units to Camden are in El Dorado, a roughly 40-minute drive, and Arkadelphia, roughly an hour’s drive.
Camden’s hospital is the seventh in Arkansas to close its labor and delivery unit since 2020. Among the other six is the hospital in Warren, an hour’s drive from Camden.
The closure leaves only 32 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties with labor and delivery units.
Amanda Warren-Newton, president of the Arkansas Ambulance Association and owner of Columbia County Ambulance Service, said she’s “working to elevate the competency” of paramedics to care for patients and their babies before and after birth because of the shortage of delivery units, she said. Columbia County borders Ouachita County to the southwest.
Republican Sen. Matt Stone of Camden said Friday that the Ouachita County Medical Center’s closed obstetric unit is a symptom of the ongoing struggles facing maternal health providers, especially in rural areas.
“I think that’s going to cause other problems with infant mortality and taking care of mothers and everything else, but they’re just trying to keep the doors open,” Stone said.
Arkansas consistently has among the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality nationwide, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
The Ouachita County Medical Center employed an obstetric physician who will be leaving the state now that the labor and delivery unit has closed, Harper said. She also said two obstetric nurses who worked in the closed unit have been transferred to the hospital’s emergency room.
“If obstetric patients present with urgent needs in the ER, there are people there who can take care of them,” Harper said. “What we’ll do is assess them, stabilize them, and then transfer if their condition warrants it, and if not, treat them and send them home, if it’s not obstetric needs. We will have the capability to monitor to see if they’re in labor and what the fetal heart rates are.”
Trading inpatient care for more federal money works for some, not all rural Arkansas hospitals

Most of the Camden hospital’s patients are admitted through its emergency room, Harper said. The hospital applied this week to become a rural emergency hospital, which would allow it to collect more federal funds in exchange for reducing or eliminating inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment. It would be the sixth Arkansas hospital to assume this designation if the federal government approves the application.
Rural hospitals with 50 beds or fewer are eligible to apply for rural emergency hospital status. If accepted, they are subsequently licensed for zero inpatient beds.
Patients’ average stay at a rural emergency hospital over the course of a year must be no more than 24 hours, according to federal eligibility requirements. Delivering a baby via Cesarean section requires two or three days in a hospital for post-birth observation, so the Ouachita County Medical Center would have had to limit its obstetric services to low-risk patients only if the maternity ward had remained open, Harper said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ambulance-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 19:12:53.961487

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — A naturalized citizen from Louisville decided to run for the state House the night before the filing deadline, spurred by a Kentucky lawmaker’s proposal to bar immigrant citizens from holding local and state elected offices.
Suhas Kulkarni, who immigrated to the U.S. from India in 1986, told reporters that the legislation was “the straw that broke the camel’s back” before filing his paperwork at the Kentucky secretary of state’s office Friday. 
Kulkarni’s daughter, Rep. Nima Kulkarni, also a naturalized citizen and an immigration lawyer, has represented Louisville’s 40th House District since 2019 and is seeking reelection this year. She and her mother joined the elder Kulkarni as he officially threw his hat into the ring.
“I said, ‘Something’s got to be done about this.’ And then we talked about it and we said that our family has had the actual experience of the American Dream,” he said, adding that his family “struggled really hard” to build up a business, has paid taxes, served with community groups and more. 
“At the end of the day, if somebody says to me that after all of this, you’re not eligible to have some of the rights that citizens have, I don’t agree with it,” Kulkarni said. “So, I said this is not the time for me to sit on the sidelines.” 
The bills Kulkarni referred to, House Bill 186 and House Bill 259, were filed by Rep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, in the first week of this year’s General Assembly. Baker told Kentucky Public Radio that his goal is to prevent those who have naturalized citizenship or dual citizenship from taking the state in an unspecified “direction.” 
Suhas Kulkarni said his family came to the U.S. seeking help for his older son who had learning disabilities. His son eventually attended The de Paul School in Louisville. He added that “we jumped from the lunch rooms of executive offices where I was working (in India) to sweeping the floor in a neighborhood grocery store.” He later bought the store and expanded an export business with it. 
In the 1990s, Kulkarni started an information technology business which later gained federal government contracts. 
When he turned 60, he felt that “there’s got to be something more in life,” so he turned to public service. He joined former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer’s administration and founded the Office for Globalization, which is now called the Office for Immigrant Affairs.
Kulkarni said that there are “so many more benefits being a cohesive community as opposed to being an exclusive community” and he wants the next generation to have those benefits. 
“This is America — the land of opportunity, the land of possibilities, the land where people can come when people can work hard, achieve what they can do,” he said. “The American Dream — it’s not all economic, it’s social, it’s the mingling of cultures, it’s the strengthening of the gene pool.”
The incumbent Republican in the 48th House District is Rep. Ken Fleming, who is seeking reelection. Another Democratic candidate, Nathan Bellows, filed to run in the district last month. The district includes parts of Jefferson County.
Democrats and Republicans gear up for 2026
Ahead of the 4 p.m. deadline, Kentucky candidates vying for offices across the state were whisked through the secretary of state’s office Friday to put the final signatures on their paperwork.

Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said his office had received 437 net new filings since the filing period opened in November, including candidates for state and federal office. 
Adams said this year’s deadline day was “pretty slow.” Looking over the list of candidates, he said he noticed a lot of Republican primaries in Northern Kentucky this time around and his office had also seen “a real uptick” in Democrats filing for the state House this week. 
“I’m guessing KDP (the Kentucky Democratic Party) really worked it, or the caucus really worked it to get people to file for a lot of these seats that had been unopposed previously,” Adams said. 
Ahead of the filing deadline, House Democratic leaders were hopeful of growing their caucus this election cycle. During a press conference Thursday morning, House Democratic Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, said Democrats would have more contested races outside of Lexington and Louisville this year.
“You will see more contested races,” she said. “We will grow this caucus, and we will make sure that what stays at the center of who we are are the people.” 
KDP spokesperson Nat Turner told the Lantern in a statement Friday that the party was “thrilled to have more than 700 Democrats running for local offices all over Kentucky and nearly 100 running for seats in the General Assembly.”
“This excitement is a testament to the energy we are building around our common goal of reinforcing the American Dream, so Kentuckians in every county have good-paying jobs, access to quality health care and education and the opportunity to build a better life for their families,” she said. 
On the GOP side, Republicans remained confident that they will maintain their caucus numbers in the legislature. At present, Republicans have 80 seats to the Democrats’ 20 in the House, and 32 seats to the Democrats’ 6 in the Senate. 
In a press release after the deadline, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, highlighted that eight members of his caucus are seeking reelection unopposed. 
“This is more than just a political milestone. It is a strong vote of confidence from Kentuckians in the direction our commonwealth is heading,” Stivers said. “That level of confidence reflects the strength of the conservative, responsible policies the Senate majority has championed for the past decade, which have delivered results and earned the trust of Kentuckians.” 
Sen. Max Wise, the Republican floor leader in the Senate, told reporters Friday morning that the caucus had been “very aggressive in fundraising to make sure that we’ve got our resources available for members who may have challenging opponents.” 
“We look forward to any challenges that come our way,” he said. We feel very strong with our supermajority of who we’ve got to be there to protect them, to hold their seats when it comes either May or November.” 
Who’s filed?
In the legislature, all seats in the Kentucky House of Representatives will be on the ballot, as well as about a third of Senate seats. Some lawmakers have announced they will not seek reelection in 2026, paving the way for candidates to run for a few open seats, while some incumbents will be challenged. More than 50 general elections in the legislature will be contested, according to filings as of Friday afternoon. 
In Louisville, three Democrats are challenging Democratic state Rep. Danield Grossberg. They are Jefferson County Public Schools teacher Cassie Lyles, former JCPS teacher and political adviser Max Morley and Mitra Subedi, who narrowly lost the 2024 primary to Grossberg by 50 votes before allegations of inappropriate behavior towards women last year against Grossberg were made public. Grossberg faced no opposing candidate in the 2024 general election. 
Democratic Rep. Adam Moore of the 45th House District in central Kentucky, is being challenged by a former Republican lawmaker, Killian Timoney, who was defeated in the 2024 primary. Moore won the election later that fall. Both had filed their election paperwork ahead of Friday. Jeffrey D. Thompson, a Republican, filed Wednesday. 
In the 93rd House District, Democratic Rep. Adrielle Camuel is being challenged by Hannah Rivera, a Republican who filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Kentucky Community and Technical College System in 2024. Rivera had worked at KCTCS in several capacities over a decade, including as chief of staff. The lawsuit is still pending in Franklin Circuit Court, according to court records. 
Those that aren’t seeking reelection include Republicans Rep. Ryan Dotson of the 73rd House District, Rep. David Hale of the 74th House District, Sen. Jimmy Higdon of the 14th Senate District and Democratic Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty of the 95th House District. Dotson is running in the GOP primary for the 6th Congressional District. 
Laferty is the last remaining Eastern Kentucky Democrat in the House at present. The race for her seat will be contested, as two Republicans, Willie Crase Jr. and Tanner Hesterberg, and a Democrat, former state Sen. Johnny Ray Turner, have filed for the seat. 
In judicial races, Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Chief Debra Lambert is up for reelection, and has filed to run again for the state’s high court. She faces no opponent. Lambert, who became Kentucky’s first female chief justice in 2025, represents the 3rd Judicial District, which includes parts of Central and Southeastern Kentucky. 
A seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals is open after Supreme Court Justice Pamela Goodwine won election to the high court in 2024. The seat covers the 5th Appellate District in Central Kentucky. Those who have filed to run for the seat are Fayette County Circuit Judge Lucy Ferguson Van Meter and Judge Will Moynahan, who was appointed to fill Goodwine’s vacancy on the appellate court by Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Twelve Republicans and seven Democrats have filed to run for the seat currently held by longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who announced last year that he would not seek reelection.
Kentucky’s six congressional seats are also on the ballot, and all incumbent U.S. representatives have filed for reelection with the exception of Republican Andy Barr, who is running for the open Senate seat.

Scams are costing the state’s event venues tens of thousands of dollars.

Picture this. You love the Indigo Girls. Imagine your excitement, then, when you discover they’re playing at your favorite local venue, The Flynn, in Burlington. You click the first link and go to purchase tickets, only to discover an exorbitant $250 price tag. You love the Indigo Girls, but you also need to pay your mortgage, so you pass. 
Then, you notice the website looks suspicious. It’s not The Flynn you’re buying from. It was a scam.
“Ladies and gentleman, that woman was me,” Susan Evans McClure, executive director of the Vermont Arts Council, told the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee Friday. “I realized that if I, the director of the Vermont Arts Council, didn’t realize I was being faked by a fake website, who else was being harmed by this?” 
McClure was there to testify on H.512, a bill that seeks to enhance consumer protections against predatory and scam ticket resellers. 
Though lawmakers still need to hash out the details of the legislation, it appears to have broad bipartisan support for some of its possible concepts, like a 10% cap on resell ticket markups, banning deceptive URLs and preventing sites from selling tickets that don’t yet exist. 
These practices that the bill would aim to guard against, though perhaps outlandish sounding, are already pervasive in Vermont, according to McClure and others. She pointed to the cost of tickets for UVM men’s soccer’s final game last season, which a reseller had posted online for almost 20-times face value. 
Kevin Sweeney, director of marketing and sales at The Flynn, told the committee his team has identified more than 50 websites reselling tickets from Vermont events, 20 of which have only cropped up in the last year. 
Scammers aren’t just costing consumers; they’re costing venues, according to Sweeney. Eventgoers frequently show up to The Flynn with tickets that were sold to multiple people by fraudulent vendors, he said. To preserve customer sentiment, The Flynn refunds the tickets, according to Sweeney, and he estimated that the fraud refunds and staff time cost the business about $50,000 annually. 
“We don’t have 50,000 to spend on that. That’s a full-time person we could bring in to do programming we really want to do,” he said. 
The bill currently exists only in short form, which means legislative attorneys need to work out the nitty-gritty. But the Vermont Attorney General’s Office endorsed the broad intent of the legislation Friday, and the committee looks poised to take it up in the weeks to come. 
In the meantime, be careful out there.

In the know
Senate Republicans declared their commitment to affordability and public safety at a press conference Friday, plus their concerns for Vermont’s dwindling revenue for roads and transportation.
It raises an interesting conundrum — how Republicans will juggle declining tax revenue, Vermonters’ desire for affordability and increasing needs in areas like infrastructure.
“We’re pretty firm: no new taxes, no new fees,” Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said. “But I think we also can’t be so bullheaded to say that we’re not willing to consider tax reform.”

Nearly our national bird
“The wild turkey has a special place in my heart as everybody knows,” Rep. Chris Pritchard, R-Pawlet, told the Vermont House Environment Committee while talking about the success of wild turkey restoration in West Pawlet. He said the birds were now in every town in the state of Vermont “for everybody to enjoy.”

A shrine appeared Friday memorializing the Capitol cafeteria’s lost microwave. Or Michael Wave, as one missive labeled the machine.
Flowers, a heartfelt ode, some amateur graphic design — the gravesite could move even the most cynical lobbyist to tears. If not tears of sadness, at least tears borne of hunger.
I do take issue with the microwave being labeled “comrade.” Inquisitive minds recognize the machine as a tool of capitalist ghouls, whose obsession with productivity has turned the midday meal into something to be scarfed down under expedited duress.

Today they merged their efforts.,"In summary
ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Common Sense Media had rival ballot initiatives designed to protect kids from chatbots. Today they merged their efforts.




Kids safety advocate Common Sense Media and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI joined together today to advance a ballot measure that would amend the California Constitution in order to protect kids from companion chatbots online.
The two previously planned to place competing initiatives before voters, each stipulating that the one that got the most “yes” votes would win. OpenAI’s proposal largely reflected existing law, while the Common Sense measure included new bans on what AI systems children could access.
The merged measure is known as the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act. It would, among other things:

Require chatbot developers use technology to estimate a user’s age range and apply filters and protective settings for  people with an age predicted under the age of 18
Require AI systems to undergo independent audits to identify child safety risks and report them to the California attorney general
Ban child-targeted advertising and the sale or sharing of kids’ data without a parent’s consent
Stop manipulation through emotional dependency by preventing AI systems from promoting isolation from family or friends, simulating romantic relationships with kids, or claiming that they’re sentient

 A Common Sense spokesperson said the measure was filed Thursday afternoon. It’s not yet visible on the attorney general’s website but you can read a copy obtained by CalMatters here. As described in a press release, the combined measure drops a ban on student smartphones in K-12 California schools and prohibition on minors using chatbots capable of engaging in erotic or sexually explicit talk that were part of Common Sense Media’s original initiative. 
The initiative must receive 546,651 signatures in order to come before voters in November. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber has until June 25 to determine if it reaches that threshold or qualifies for the ballot.
Common Sense put forward its original ballot initiative, the California Kids AI Safety Act, last fall, not long after the Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill the nonprofit had authored that contained similar provisions.
In response, in December 2025, OpenAI put forward a competing ballot measure that mirrors a bill that Newsom signed into law last October, requiring companion chatbot providers to enact a suicidal ideation protocol and inform people every three hours that they’re speaking with AI. Critics called that move manipulative and designed to thwart stronger protections for kids.
Common Sense Media research has found that seven in 10 teens have used companion chatbots and that the tech is too dangerous to be used by minors. In promoting its original ballot initiative, the group warned that without action the tech could lead to more harm and addiction for young people. In one well-publicized case, the parents of California teen Adam Raine sued OpenAI, alleging Raine was coached by OpenAI’s ChatGPT to commit suicide.
OpenAI’s willingness to compromise marks a contrast with how tech companies banded together to get their way in a policy fight in 2020. That year, major gig economy players like DoorDash, Instacart, Lyft, and Uber spent $200 million bankrolling a successful ballot initiative regulating gig work, Proposition 22. It effectively exempted them from a state law that would have required the companies to provide full employment benefits to their drivers.
Sen. Steve Padilla, the Chula Vista Democrat who carried the chatbot bill signed by Newsom, called the merged ballot measure a significant breakthrough. But he added that he thinks the matter should be handled by lawmakers and the governor instead of directly by voters. Since the ballot initiative would amend the state constitution, Padilla said it “would create an unnecessarily high-bar to revise and update that law in the future. Moreover, legislative hearings will provide the broader public an opportunity to comment and provide input on this important issue.” 
In recent weeks, Padilla has proposed a bill that requires age verification for chatbot use and a four-year moratorium on the sale of toys with companion chatbots inside. OpenAI signed a partnership with Barbie-maker Mattel but has yet to produce any products.
OpenAI’s fight at the California ballot box isn’t limited to kids’ online safety issues. One proposed ballot initiative would give a state commission the power to slow or stop AI model development if commission members suspect catastrophic risk of harm to Californians. Two other proposals target corporate conversions from nonprofit to for-profit companies, as OpenAI has planned. The initiatives compel nonprofits that restructure in such a way to dedicate all their assets to the public benefit of humanity. To reach that goal, the initiatives would create a commission that has the power to shut down AI models and that hosts competitions that invite the public to propose ways AI can help humanity. Under one of the initiatives, the commission would also have the power to revoke nonprofit conversions.
OpenAI was founded about a decade ago with a charter stating its purpose was to benefit humanity. Its plans to convert to a public benefit corporation led to heavy criticism from nonprofits and scrutiny by attorneys general in California and Delaware. Both states eventually reached agreements with OpenAI to allow a restructuring after the company agreed to place roughly 25% of its assets into a nonprofit.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/032123-Open-AI-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

The state had been blocked from enforcing the policy since a 2018 federal court order found that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The order was in response to Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s request made in October to remove the block, citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited such broad-reaching bans. 
“For years, Idaho was blocked from enforcing common-sense policy and law requiring birth certificates to reflect biological sex recorded at birth,” Labrador said in a press release Friday. “Birth certificates aren’t symbolic documents that are subject to how an individual may feel, they’re legal records used in medicine, public health research, and identification. Idaho can now enforce our law protecting accurate vital records, while treating all Idahoans equally under the same amendment process.”
The nation’s high court ruled that federal judges can, in most cases, only place injunctions on laws that affect the plaintiffs in the case. In a court agreement filed Dec. 5, 2025, both sides of the case agreed that one of the transgender plaintiffs had already received their amended birth certificate and the other had chosen to remove themselves from the case. 
The lawsuit was filed in 2017 by attorneys from Lambda Legal on behalf of a transgender Idahoan woman and was later amended to add another trans woman from Idaho as plaintiff against officials from the Department of Health and Welfare and Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics. 
Peter Renn, senior counsel at Lambda Legal and one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email Friday that the change was in response to the Supreme Courts’ prior decision and “the fact that the original case wasn’t filed as a class action,” which a type of lawsuit brought on behalf an entire group of similarly situated people.  
“But nothing prevents a new case from being filed, and what hasn’t changed is that forcing transgender people to present birth certificates and driver’s licenses that out themselves as transgender when navigating everyday life is dangerous, archaic, and still very much unconstitutional,” Renn wrote. 
 “We anticipate that Lambda Legal may hear from Idahoans who are harmed by this development, especially because we understand that people born in Idaho may no longer be able to update the gender on their Idaho driver’s licenses to match their gender identity without access to birth certificates that reflect who they are.”

 Idaho previously had to pay over $300,000 over 2020 law that violated court order 

Despite the 2018 federal order that prohibited the state from automatically rejecting applications from transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificate, the Idaho Legislature in 2020 passed a law that limited ways birth certificates could be amended and prevented transgender individuals from changing their document. 
Later that year, a federal magistrate court again barred the state from automatically rejecting transgender Idahoans’ applications, and the court ordered the health agency to “institute a meaningful and constitutionally-sound process for accepting, reviewing, and considering applications from transgender individuals to amend the gender listed on their birth certificates,” Idaho Public Television reported.  
The court ordered that the state pay the transgender Idahoans who sued more than $300,000 for legal fees. 
Under Idaho’s law, to amend a birth certificate within one year of its issuance, Idahoans must provide a notarized affidavit declaring information was incorrectly recorded. After a year, corrections require a court action showing “fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.”

On Dec. 30, the three-person Torrance County Commission convened for a “special meeting” to extend an inter-governmental service agreement that enables ICE to house immigrant detainees at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia. Before commissioners met, the contract had been defunct for two months.
The contract extension to March 31 of this year increased the monthly payment ICE makes to the county to roughly $2.4 million, funding the county then passes on to CoreCivic. The parties also backdated the contract to Nov. 1, 2025, the date the original contract expired.
NM DOJ says it is looking into Torrance County ICE detention contract extension

Immigrant legal advocates who have long called for ICE to cease housing detainees at the facility quickly raised questions about the validity of the contract extension and also whether the commission should have provided more notice to the public about the meeting between Christmas and New Year’s Day. 
The contract extension also got the attention of the New Mexico Department of Justice. Spokesperson Chelsea Pitvorec told Source New Mexico earlier this week that the meeting “raises real concern regarding backdating a contract, compliance with the New Mexico procurement code, and whether the Open Meetings Act was complied with.”
On Friday, the NMDOJ alerted county officials via a letter that based on additional investigation the department conducted, the county likely violated the Open Meetings Act by failing to provide proper public notice. One instance the letter cites is that the county placed an advertisement about the meeting in local newspaper Mountainair Dispatch one day before the meeting instead of the required 72 hours. 
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

The letter also raises questions about whether the county could legally backdate a contract, noting that retroactive acts like that typically only occur when a public body is correcting an error. 
“The apparent retroactive extension of the County’s [agreement] with ICE is likely improper and invalid,” writes Blaine N. Moffatt, director of the NMDOJ’s Government Counsel and Accountability Bureau. 
The letter, addressed to County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach, asks the county to respond in a week with answers about how it publicly advertised the meeting and justified backdating the contract. 
County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach told Source New Mexico on Friday in a brief phone interview that the county did not violate the Open Meetings Act. He said the Torrance County attorney was already at work on a letter in response to the NMDOJ.

In a statement, Chouteau County also aired some objections it had raised in the case and outlined the way the settlement could play out.
The county said the approved settlement notes if the U.S. Supreme Court decides only the U.S. Department of Justice can bring a lawsuit under the disputed section of the Voting Rights Act, the settlement is vacated.
In the case, the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation and two Native American voters had alleged the county’s at-large voting system unlawfully diluted the voting strength of Native voters, and last month, the U.S. District Court of Montana approved the settlement.
The case centered on a section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which prohibits any “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.”
A violation of Section 2 occurs if a political process leading to an election is not equally open to participation by a minority in a jurisdiction, or the minority group has less opportunity to elect a representative of their choice than other voters.
Chouteau County sought to dismiss the case, but the judge ordered mediation.
The settlement means the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation has a chance to elect a representative of their choosing to the Chouteau County Board of Commissioners. It ensures the reservation is part of just one district in the county, and it provides for an election in the “single-member district,” where only district residents vote for their representative.
At the time of the settlement, County Attorney Stephen Gannon said Chouteau County was willing to work with the tribe and had done so in the past, especially to ensure voters were properly registered, for example.
Released this month, an additional statement from Chouteau County outlines how the case unfolded, offered criticisms of the tribe, and described how the elections would work going forward as a result of the settlement.
Approved Dec. 15, the settlement changed District 1 in the county to consist of only two precincts, and it makes District 1 a single-member district. The settlement said that means in the 2026 election, “anyone in Commissioner District 1, including a member of the Chippewa Cree Tribe,” could run for office.
“As many Chouteau County residents know, members of the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation do not pay taxes that fund Chouteau County’s government,” the statement said.
The Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation is 100% federal trust land, according to data from the Office of Public Instruction cited by the Montana Budget and Policy Center. Trust land is generally exempt from local property taxes.
Chouteau County Commissioners were unavailable for additional information in time for this story, according to legal counsel.
In response to the statement from Chouteau County, Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation said some claims require “clarification,” and noted “voting rights are not conditioned on property ownership or tax status.”
Chouteau County, though, argued that “despite not paying taxes, tribal members receive services from Chouteau County; however, Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation does not allow Chouteau County to provide services within the boundaries of the reservation.”
For example, the county said the tribe “refuses to share 911 information so the county can map addresses of its members.”
But issues related to taxation, emergency services or jurisdiction are “raised as a distraction,” the tribe said in a response provided by the Native American Rights Fund: “They were not the basis of the court’s decision and are unrelated to the right to fair representation.”
“The county is not allowed to silence the voices of any group of voters,” the tribe said. “That is what this settlement is about.”
Chairman Harlan Baker said equal rights was the point of the lawsuit.
“This case was always about equal access to the ballot and fair representation,” Baker said in a statement. “The settlement ensures that Native and non-Native voters alike have a meaningful voice in local government.”
Chouteau County said it settled despite some disagreement to avoid paying “potentially hundreds of thousands in fees.” In the settlement, each side paid its own fees.
The primary election for the new single member Commissioner District 1 will be June 2, 2026, same as the statewide primary, and the general election is scheduled for Nov. 3, 2026. Candidates may file from Feb. 17 through March 4.
In its statement, Chouteau County also talked about what happens if boundaries change in the future. It said the reservation currently overlaps Chouteau and Hill counties, and if the boundaries are modified so the reservation is located solely in Hill County, the settlement dissolves.
Also, in 2030, commissioner districts in Chouteau County will be reapportioned according to the census, Chouteau County said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3521-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A protest of approximately 20 people outside of a federal immigration detention center Friday afternoon on Albuquerque’s south side sparked several physical confrontations, resulted in the detention of two protestors and ended after federal officials threatened the crowd with arrest if they didn’t disperse.
Dare to Struggle New Mexico organized the protest outside of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in response to the fatal shooting by an ICE officer in Minnesota of 37-year-old Renee Good.
“We’re here to let them know we’re here, we’re angry, that we want to block and get crazy for them,” said one organizer Lizzie Nutig said through a megaphone in front of the gates. “We need to be loud, we need to be brave, we need to be doing things to block them.”
She continued. “We need them to know that people are mad.”
Using a megaphone, Nutig and organizer Brian McQuaid led chants including “Be like Renee and Get in the way;” “Fuera ICE;” “Smash the mass deportation machine;” along several others that contained profanities.
About five minutes into the protest, several demonstrators approached the gates outside of the facility and hung photos of the immigration agent who shot Good, and a photo of President Donald Trump with a hand-printed expletive. 
DHS officials, who had been watching the protests from the office, exited the building and shoved protestors away from the fence, and told them they were required stay on the sidewalk to protest. Officers also detained one person who Source NM has not yet been able to identify.
Additional agents wearing camouflage and Enforcement and Removal Operations patches filed outside, carrying non-lethal firearms and Saber Red pepper spray. No members of DHS identified themselves when asked by protestors or the news media. 
Protestors yelled, sometimes using expletives: “Do you like hurting people?” “Get out of here,” and “go to h-ll.”
Agents rushed at one of the protesters who yelled profanities, Adeo Herrick and, as protestors attempted to intervene, one of the agents in fatigues fired pepper spray hitting himself and at least one protester.
Herrick was then dragged to the ground and provided their name to Source NM while being carried away by multiple agents into the building. 
Shortly after 12:40 p.m., a car emblazoned with the Federal Protective Service pulled forward, blasting the loudspeaker message: “This is deemed an unlawful assembly,” ordering the protestors and media to disperse or face arrest.
When reached by phone after the protest, Nutig and McQuaid said they had not yet heard if charges were being filed against the two protestors detained and said they were in contact with attorneys. In a statement, they requested the release of the two detained protestors and the “arrest of the officers who assaulted protestors today.”
A request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement remains pending. 
Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier in the day released a statement calling for a “thorough and transparent investigation,” into Good’s death.
The governor’s statement also expressed her support for “those raising their voice in protest. Protest is fundamental to democracy — it’s how we make our government listen when something goes terribly wrong. But protests must remain peaceful.”
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Friday’s protest.

Property rights issues center on the use of eminent domain for a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. Demands to improve water quality take a couple of different approaches, including appropriated funding for a nitrate monitoring network and various land management strategies. This will the the third year that a bill related to pesticide labeling has appeared in the Iowa Statehouse.

Eminent domain and property rights
Debate around eminent domain and a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline have filled the halls of the Iowa State Capitol for the past four years and dominated the final days of the 2025 session, when lawmakers passed a bill restricting carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to build in certain areas.

The bill was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds. Landowners and lawmakers, however, are already preparing for renewed policy and debate over the issue. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association noted in its 2026 legislative priorities that it will back “all efforts to lower (the) carbon intensity score of corn-based ethanol and promote ethanol as a carbon reduction solution across all markets while maintaining property rights.” 
The association, along with renewable fuel groups, have been supportive of the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants to an underground storage site and give the ethanol and corn industry access to low-carbon fuel markets. 
Leading up to session, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, has said he plans to introduce legislation that would allow pipeline companies to route around landowners without the use of eminent domain.
Pesticide labeling 
Past bills, supported by the manufacturer of the common pesticide Roundup, would have ruled that pesticide labels issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would be sufficient in satisfying a requirement to warn users of the product’s health and safety. 
Opponents argue these bills would give pesticide companies, like Bayer and beyond, immunity from lawsuits where users claim the product gave them cancer. 
A bill passed the Senate in the 2025 session, but was not picked up in the House. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association supported the bill in 2025 and said in its 2026 policy guide that it supports “regulating pesticide residues in consumer products in finished goods, not by restricting pesticide use as labeled during production.” 
Iowans told lawmakers to “do your job” at a rally organized by Food and Water Watch on Feb. 10, 2025 in the Iowa Capitol Rotunda. They were opposing a Senate bill relating to pesticide companies. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch).
The association’s president, Mark Mueller, said in a news release that policy priorities are shaped by policy surveys and roundtable discussions with members. 
“The issues outlined in this year’s priorities reflect issues that matter most to Iowa’s corn farmers, and with the start of the legislative session next week, we are excited to fight for these issues on behalf of Iowa’s corn growers,” Mueller said. 
A policy update from Iowa Soybean Association said the ag group anticipates a bill that will “provide consistency and clarity on pesticide labeling” and provide “consistent” labeling from state to state. 
Environmental groups opposed the bill in past sessions, alleging such protections to pesticide companies stripped Iowans of their right to sue pesticide companies for causing illnesses.
The EPA holds that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is unlikely to be a carcinogen, but opponents of the bill argue otherwise. The scientific journal that originally published a key study on the safety of the chemical, recently retracted the study, citing concerns around authorship and the validity of the research findings. 
Food & Water Watch, in its “blueprint” for clean water in Iowa, said the Legislature must “resist and oppose all efforts to protect corporate pesticide manufacturers through language granting pesticides immunity from liability.” 
Water quality 
Improving water quality in Iowa has been a priority for environmental groups in Iowa for years, but things like a lawn watering ban and a water quality report in central Iowa in 2025 elevated the issue for lawmakers and other groups. 
Notably, several groups have called on the Legislature to restore funding, at $600,000 annually to the Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, which gives real-time measures of pH, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in streams across the state. 
The network has been supported by the Walton Family Foundation since the Legislature diverted funds for the network in 2023, but the funding is set to run out this summer. 
Iowa Environmental Council listed restoration of state funding for the program as a 2026 priority. 
“A clear picture of how water moves through Iowa’s waterways — along with where pollution comes from and how water quality is changing — is essential for developing effective, evidence based solutions that protect our health and ecosystems,” the council said in its legislative priorities.
The group is also asking the Legislature to protect water quality by prohibiting the discharge of coal ash leachate, a byproduct of burning coal, into waterways. 
Food & Water Watch, a non-profit environmental group, called for the restoration of funding for the water monitoring system in its long list of priorities for clean water in Iowa. 
The group pointed to nitrate as the “primary pollutant of concern” in Iowa waterways. Food & Water Watch asked for an end to large animal feeding operations in “vulnerable” groundwater areas, tighter language around manure lagoons and manure application procedures and requirements that producers submit manure management plans to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and other policy recommendations.
“Iowa’s current policies fail to keep the public informed or to address pollution before it reaches people’s drinking water,” the blueprint reads. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association also noted conservation and water quality as top priorities for 2026. 
The association asked the Legislature to maintain funding for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy — a state-led program to assess and reduce nutrient runoff into Iowa waters and the Mississippi River. The strategy promotes practices like cover crops, fine-tuned fertilizer application and reduced tillage, but it does not mandate nutrient reductions. 
Other priorities: 
Lawmakers have highlighted that lowering Iowa property taxes will be a key goal of the 2026 session and Iowa farm groups noted property tax policies were also a priority this year. 
Ag groups also spoke in favor of a comprehensive agriculture bill, not yet filed but proposed, by Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. The bill includes provisions for tax relief, expanded economic opportunities and enhanced biosecurity policies. 
Last year lawmakers considered several bills restricting food ingredients, including banning margarine from school lunches. Iowa Soybean Association noted that it would continue to advocate for the health attributes and safety of soy-based foods in the wake of similar bills.
Iowa Environmental Council additionally called on the Legislature to invest in programs and resources to reduce the prevalence of radon exposure in Iowa residences. Radon is a naturally occurring gas that has been linked to lung cancer. 
Lawmakers are scheduled to begin the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12.

Due to cited safety concerns and inadequate staff training, United Counseling Service has until March to address the issues in its group living homes.

State officials gave a warning to United Counseling Service this December: Fix your longstanding problems, or risk losing your current ability to operate.
The state’s problem with the nonprofit provider’s service lines for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities include safety concerns that “put clients and staff at risk of harm” — things like failure to comply with housing inspections, high staff turnover and inadequate staff training and skills — according to the Vermont Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Now the Bennington-based agency must follow a corrective action plan and submit evidence to the department by March 2, to confirm that it has addressed the concerns. During this time, the agency is on a probationary status and unable to take new admissions of people seeking its services for intellectual disabilities.
United Counseling Service is one of the state’s 14 designated agencies — private, nonprofit organizations that the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living and the Vermont Department of Mental Health co-operatively contract with in each county to provide mental health care and human services, like care for those with intellectual disabilities and substance use disorders.
United Counseling Service sees 150 people with developmental disabilities. That includes medical care; different staffed, supervised, and group living arrangements; and transportation supports, among other services.
A key feature of the United Counseling Service’s support for those with developmental disabilities are the agency’s residential programs. The agency owns and operates three group living homes, with support professionals and a house manager in each residence full-time. The agency also facilitates “staffed living” for those with higher levels of need to receive more direct support in apartment-style residences, and it also coordinates shared living agreements for individuals to live in community members’ homes. Currently, the Bennington agency contracts with 28 shared living homes — 22 of which have been fully inspected and approved, the agency’s Director of Community Relations and Development, Heidi French, told VTDigger.
Care for six current clients is likely to be moved to another agency, she added, due to the safety concerns raised by the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Separately, the agency also provides mental health services and substance use treatment. The mental health and substance use service lines remain unaffected by concerns from the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living, which specifically address care for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
To maintain designated status, an agency must meet criteria set and reviewed by the department. According to those at the department, United Counseling Service is not meeting the mark, and it hasn’t for quite some time.
In 2024, United Counseling Service’s status was knocked down to a provisional designation (“provisional designation without intent to de-designate”). Last month, it knocked that provisional status down one-degree further, to “provisional designation with intent to de-designate” (emphasis added).
If the agency loses its designation, it will no longer be able to receive state and federal funds from Medicaid for the care it provides those with intellectual disabilities, and the state would need to designate a different organization as the replacement. The department has 90 days following United Counseling Service’s March 2 submission of evidence to decide whether to begin the de-designation process. 
Other designated agencies have reached this point in the past, explained Vermont House Human Services Committee Chair Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who was briefed on the issue. In those cases, the agency at issue has worked across the network of fellow agencies through Vermont Care Partners to share resources and regain full designation status. 
“It’s unfortunate because [United Counseling Service is] an organization that historically has been very strong. Sometimes this happens when you have a lot of turnover in key leadership, and they have had quite a bit of turnover in leadership positions,” Wood said.
In its more specific role in regulating residential facilities, the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living has also mandated that the agency bring its shared living homes in line with safety requirements earlier than the March 2 deadline or risk having the department withhold administrative costs for the homes that remain noncompliant.
“We have been and are continuing to do everything we can to ensure we come into compliance. This shift in designation indicates there’s a continued need to do that critical work in order to get back to full designation status,” French wrote in an email to VTDigger. 
She said that United Counseling Service is working on additional training and staff oversight and ensuring its shared living homes are inspected and compliant with safety standards.

Following up on a promise from earlier this week, the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives has filed a lawsuit against 31 state governments departments and their heads in an effort to bar them from accessing $645 million in work project spending. 
In December, Republican members of the Michigan House Appropriations Committee voted along party lines to disapprove more than half a billion dollars of work projects funds, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers and multiple Republicans.
Following a request from Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, determined that the maneuver used to cut the funds process violated the separation of powers clause and other requirements in the Michigan Constitution.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While Democrats cheered Nessel’s determination, with Anthony calling it “a lifeline for the countless non-profit organizations and local governments that have been left in limbo for weeks,” Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) were quick to criticize Nessel’s opinion as partisan and flawed. 
“Our lawsuit will stop this Nessel power-trip and uphold the law that allows the Legislature to put an end to this nonsense,” Hall said in a statement Friday. 
The suit, filed with the Michigan Court of Claims seeks immediate injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order to bar Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration from utilizing the funding.

(Photo illustration/Rhode Island Department of Administration image)Some unionized state employees say the state’s new payroll system is not functioning properly and has led to error-ridden paychecks for multiple pay periods. 
Statements released Thursday from three different unions representing state employees hint at ongoing issues with the rollout of the shiny, modern and long-awaited system — including missing wages, incorrect pay, and problems with overtime, benefits, and deductions. 
The legacy payroll system went away for good in early December, its aging architecture swapped out for a new system anchored in the cloud-based software Workday. The payroll upgrade is but one aspect of the state’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) endeavor, which began implementation in 2023 and wrapped up last year, consolidating and modernizing the state’s payroll, human resources and other internal IT infrastructure. 
While Workday does not handle support or configuration for the state system — that’s the responsibility of a separate state vendor — the unions have directed some of their ire at the software.
Rhode Island Council 94, which represents about 4,500 state workers and claims to be the state’s largest public sector union, released a statement that said missing or incomplete pay, mistakes in holiday pay or overtime, and deductions not hitting investment accounts were among the numerous complaints received from members.
“Workday is not working,” Council 94 President Michael McDonald wrote.
Council 94 Executive Director Alexis Santoro said the state has worked to correct some complaints, but then the union receives more each day.
The Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers said in a separate statement that labor orgs representing “thousands” of public employees have heard member complaints for three consecutive pay periods. Like Council 94, the correctional officers’ union cited missing pay, underpayments, unpaid overtime and incorrect deductions.
“Correctional officers are doing one of the most dangerous jobs in state government,” Brotherhood President Richard Ferruccio said. “Violence is up, staffing is strained, and mandatory overtime is routine. Asking officers to shoulder those risks and then failing to pay them correctly, especially after three consecutive pay periods and right before the holidays, is completely unacceptable.”
Yet another statement came from SEIU Local 580, which represents frontline employees across eight state agencies. The same paycheck-related laments from other unions are contained in the SEIU news release, with the union’s President Matthew Gunnip claiming one documented case concerns “a member with nearly three decades of state service who is undergoing cancer treatment is now facing leave without pay because required documentation was not processed during the ERP transition.”
“When pay problems happen once, that’s a mistake,” Gunnip wrote. “When they happen repeatedly, that’s a breakdown. At this point, the risk and stress are being absorbed entirely by workers.”
“I’ve been in regular communication with the local unions representing state workers and they are very frustrated by the continued problems with state payroll,” Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and one of the state’s top labor leaders said over email Friday. “We are ready to work with the administration to address the ongoing concerns so the problems are addressed.”
Workers’ frustrations have coalesced into demands for a formal hearing before the General Assembly’s oversight committees. Council 94’s McDonald said in his statement that the legislature’s oversight committees need to “start scrutinizing” and “facilitate an independent review of what went wrong” with the payroll rollout.

“Oversight is absolutely needed!” Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat who serves as first vice chair on the House Committee on Oversight, said via text message Friday.
“How dare the state mess up at this time of year…or any time of year … on such a sensitive issue,” Casimiro wrote. “Some employees live paycheck to paycheck and may need to make a choice between heat or food…Will there be any accountability on this with the state employees overseeing this? We need answers … and our state employees need answers!”
The Department of Administration was responsible for the ERP rollout, and spokesperson Karen Greco said via email Friday that the state anticipated “adjustments” during the multi-year process to upgrade a system which she said covers more than 15,000 employees on payroll.
“The State is currently tracking about 1,700 open payroll-related tickets; we have closed almost 1,900 payroll-related tickets since the first checks were disbursed in early December,” Greco wrote, noting that some employees may have more than one ticket.
Greco said the state is prioritizing anyone who may have been underpaid, and “has made progress each week” by “issuing frequent off-cycle payments as issues get resolved to quickly provide any funds owed to employees.”
The department has cut off-cycle checks on six separate instances over the last month, Greco said.
An unsigned statement shared Friday by Workday noted that “modernizing decades of operations onto a single, unified platform is inherently complex — moving data and workflows from dozens of disconnected legacy systems, including manual and paper-based processes, into one modern system of record.” 
Workday said it was “working closely with the State and its deployment partner to support this transition, and are fully focused on ensuring accurate and timely pay.”
Workday, however, is just the bedrock of software on which the payroll rests, and is not the state vendor responsible for configuring the software. The state’s website and project materials note that Accenture — a global consulting and professional services firm with offices worldwide, including one in Boston — is the implementation partner for its new enterprise infrastructure.
Accenture did not respond to multiple requests for comment Friday.
Payroll wasn’t built in a day
Like any ERP project of considerable scale, Rhode Island’s modernization for its enterprise software was not a singular task, and strategic planning began as far back as 2019.

State purchasing documents for a 2024 solicitation related to the software planning noted that, at the time, “nearly all” of the Department of Administration’s internal processing was still manual in nature, with timesheets submitted in hard copy or as PDFs. 
The old system also ran on a mainframe and was based on the programming language COBOL, first released 66 years ago but revised many times over. Though practically ancient by coding standards, COBOL retains great utility and reliability in the colossal systems used by governments, banks and big businesses. According to IBM, it still powers 80% of  in-person credit card sales and 95% of ATM transactions. Still, many organizations are now migrating away from COBOL as its most veteran practitioners retire.
Hundreds of state workers still await merit raises. McKee’s cabinet heads don’t face the same delay.

During a March 2025 hearing at the State House, DOA Director Jonathan Womer outlined the herculean efforts the ERP entailed, even in tiny Rhode Island, with his department “going through 50-plus collective bargaining agreements and rules and regulations around payroll, primarily for employees.”
Womer also noted the importance of the project then: “We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions. We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.”
The state’s ERP website, which has been live since at least May 2024 per the “last updated” timestamps, includes numerous links, phone numbers, and information relating for state employees on the project.
The website noted that the changes would come in two phases: Certain internal finance operations would go live on July 1, 2025, while “human capital management” and payroll would come later in fall 2025.
The site also hosts a blog attributed to a mascot called Big Red, a Rhode Island Red chicken sporting blue-framed sunglasses that explains the ERP in lay terms across his blog posts.

“Currently, our HR, Payroll and Finance systems are lacking,” Big Red explains in one post. “We have siloed, outdated (downright archaic) systems, processes and tools that involve the use of paper forms and typewriters, minimal interaction between systems, and a gazillion custom reports all because we’ve got … siloed, outdated (did I mention they’re archaic) systems… well, you get the point.” 
In a post from August 2025, Big Red promised the state was “taking additional steps to guarantee system functionality for everyone.” 
“Remember when I said more testing – that includes enhanced payroll testing,” the post notes. “Money, money, moneyyy! We are running multiple parallel payroll tests to triple check the math.”
The chicken’s enthusiasm is not quite echoed in general discourse about ERP transitions, which are often regarded as intensive and high-risk projects.
A 2020 report from 18F, a digital services team working under the U.S. General Services Administration, warned that big governmental software projects have a low success rate, with only 13% of projects priced over $6 million seeing satisfactory completion on time and within budget. Success rates for projects under $1 million soared much higher to 57%.
“It’s counterintuitive, but spending more money on a project increases the chances of failure,” the report noted.
In 2025, Rhode Island’s enterprise planning project was priced at around $91.2 million.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-09 22:57:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"After ICE protest, Hartford police launch investigation",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/09/hartford-police-investigate-ice-pepper-spray/,Hartford police are investigating the hit-and-run and pepper spraying of people near a protest of ICE's actions in the Renee Good death.,"As elected officials and activists tried to make sense of Thursday evening’s events, in which one person was struck by a vehicle and at least half a dozen were pepper sprayed near a peaceful protest, they encouraged Connecticut residents to continue to show up to voice dissent. But they urged caution when confronting federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam on Friday morning told reporters that the events of the previous night were being investigated by the local police and the Department of Homeland Security. As hundreds gathered in front of a federal building in Hartford Thursday night in a peaceful vigil spurred by the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minnesota, some protesters moved to the opposite side of the building where the confrontation occurred. 
“We will be investigating what appears to be a hit-and-run incident by the what we believe to be a federal employee, as we would any other hit-and-run in the city of Hartford,” Arulampalam said. The Hartford police will also be investigating the use of pepper spray as an assault, and the incident of an object being thrown at a vehicle as property destruction.
Asked if the people driving the vehicles involved in the altercation were ICE agents, he said that “it’s a strong suspicion.”
ICE did not respond to a request for information about the incident.
Protests during the second Trump administration have remained largely peaceful in Connecticut over the past year, as crowds, sometimes numbering in the thousands, took to the streets with handmade signs to hear speeches and exercise their First Amendment right to voice dissent. 
On Thursday, a few people with megaphones ran toward those gathered at the vigil. The sound of speeches was temporarily interrupted by urgent cries to come to the other side of the building.
Even as volunteers at the official event urged people not to leave the vigil, dozens went, some under the impression that they were attempting to stop a detainee from being taken away by ICE in vehicles that were leaving the building’s parking lot on the other side of the building. They gathered in the street. In the confrontation, a woman was pushed down by a vehicle, which rapidly reversed. Another person threw an object at a van, breaking a window. At least half a dozen people were sprayed with pepper spray by a man wearing a mask.
With the identities of the drivers of the vehicles and the person who deployed the pepper spray unknown, Arulampalam said the incidents are being treated as unsolved crimes.
He said DHS has indicated that they’re conducting an internal investigation. 
“They’re refusing to share any details with us until that completes itself,” he said. 
Arulampalam was one of several elected officials to offer a tempered reaction to Thursday’s events: he criticized the role of the Trump administration in escalating violence while warning Connecticut residents not to play into the caricature of violent protesters in American cities that’s being used to justify events like the killing of Good.
Arulampalam said that the violence that occurred on Thursday night “is a direct result of the lawlessness and recklessness of the Trump administration that has occurred over the past year and that last night came here to the city of Hartford, that resulted earlier this week in the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis. That chaos that we saw last night didn’t come from the city of Hartford.”
Arulampalam expressed pessimism that the federal government would be cooperating with local officials on the investigation, and said the lack of cooperation “stymies the efforts of local law enforcement,” to solve the case.
John Cappadona came to the vigil on Thursday evening and said he watched a man hurl expletives at police officers.
“In high school you would have said he’s picking a fight,” Cappadona said.
Cappadona was impressed by Hartford police, who impassively waited until the man walked away, and by peacekeepers who tried to keep people calm. He said he would encourage anyone put off by reports of pepper spray to come to the next protest and see for themselves: “you can expect that the police and peacekeeping people will do their best to ensure safety and it was very effective.”
Arulampalam said that police officers in Hartford are trained to deescalate in such situations. “Federal agents are sent in to enforce and don’t care about what happens in communities that they run through, don’t care about the aftermath of those actions. They have very different directives and visions of success,” Arulampalam said. “In general, we don’t want violence in this city. This is a city that is working to build a community that is an antidote to the chaos we are seeing at the federal level.” 
At a separate press conference on Friday morning, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., supported Arulampalam and the city of Hartford in its handling of the incident and investigation.
Blumenthal decried the shooting of Good by an ICE agent and said that the killing was part of a pattern of excessive use of force on the part of ICE agents that has repeated across the U.S., according to a December report he produced with other lawmakers on the excessive use of force by ICE and CBP. “The pattern of escalating indefensible violence must be investigated, restrained and reformed,” he said.
Gov. Ned Lamont spoke after Blumenthal and echoed his horror at the Good killing. Lamont also commented on the events in Hartford on Thursday night. “As usual 99% of the folks were there peacefully, stepping up and saying this is not right. There was an incident behind the courthouse as you heard the mayor describe and I just want to urge each and every one of you: Make sure you exercise your right to free speech, exercise your right to protest, but you do it peacefully. Don’t let Fox News take one isolated incident behind and say, ‘see it’s happening on both sides.’ It’s not.”
Lamont commended Connecticut police who are “taught not to put gasoline on the flames but to put out the flames and let people get about their lives peacefully.”
Asked more about the incident by reporters, Lamont said, “This is the issue: ICE took an open window and shot somebody in the head and shot her dead and she was an innocent mother of three. I don’t want anything to distract from that. You’re doing just what President Trump says if there’s a demonstration here in Hartford, a couple of people do something they shouldn’t do, that’s what distracts. He takes advantage of issues and distractions like that. Don’t let that happen.”
Blumenthal added that he has been to countless Indivisible rallies in recent months across the state, and “they have been uniformly, peaceful, orderly, well-conducted. That’s Connecticut. And, we’ll see from the video, and I’ve seen some videos of what happened last night, for almost everyone in front of the courthouse, the demonstration and the protest was peaceful and orderly. We’ll know more about what happened in back of the courthouse when those two vehicles sought to leave it, because for me at least it’s not clear yet and there needs to be an investigation.”
At the same time, Blumenthal encouraged people to dissent and get out to protest. Blumenthal said that peaceful protest is “an obligation.”
“When people use violence, they undermine their cause. They play into the hands of authoritarian dictators. And the history of the rise of authoritarianism involves the invoking of violence as a pretext for cracking down on lawful dissent. That’s what we need to avoid.”
National protest organizations like ICE Out for Good have instructed protesters across the country to be nonviolent, follow the law and “bring your most peaceful attitude even in these tense times.”
Activist leadership in Connecticut contacted by The Connecticut Mirror were reluctant to speak about the incident in its aftermath. Several declined to be interviewed, some citing ongoing confusion about just what had happened and how the events were sparked.
On X, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he had spoken with Arulampalam and echoed Blumenthal’s sentiment. “My team and I will continue to gather details,” he said. “People are right to be furious, but it’s important for our protest to be peaceful. The intent of DHS’s inhumanity is to provoke a fight. Don’t let them win.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_HartfordCityHallICE_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo courtesy of Nelson Thibault)At the Agent Orange Memorial wreath laying ceremony conducted in Sunset, Utah on Dec. 13, 2025, the flag of South Vietnam was prominently displayed opposite Old Glory. 
The placement of the yellow and red South Vietnamese flag at the ceremony was a symbolic gesture intended to send a meaningful message to Vietnamese-Americans living in the Beehive State.
The wreath laying event was an inaugural ceremony presided over by Larry Kerr, chairman of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF), at the site of the Agent Orange Memorial in Sunset Veterans Park.
On that momentous occasion, Larry wanted to recognize Vietnamese veterans who were U.S. allies during the Vietnam War. Those veterans were also exposed to Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides.
Displaying the South Vietnamese flag at the wreath laying ceremony seemed like an appropriate way to express such a worthwhile message. So on the morning of the ceremony, Larry took the flag from his garage and brought it with him.
That particular flag has quite a notable history. Larry, a Vietnam veteran, brought the flag home from South Vietnam about 57 years earlier. The wreath laying ceremony afforded him a great opportunity to put it to good use.
After the flag was put on a short pole, it was set to the right of the U.S. flag. Each flag flanked the Agent Orange Memorial information stand, where a specially prepared wreath was laid.
A short distance beyond the stand, the partially completed monument towered high above the ground. Even without its panels and other attachments, the memorial is quite an imposing structure.
Larry plans to display the South Vietnamese flag at future UAOVF events. He feels that it will resonate with Utah’s Vietnamese-American community, because it represents something that was worth fighting for.
In the spring of 1975, that struggle to preserve freedom ended quite tragically with the fall of Saigon. And soon after, the displaying of a South Vietnamese national flag essentially came to an end as well.
At the wreath laying ceremony however, the yellow and red flag was displayed to pay tribute to South Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange exposure who struggled to preserve their freedom in an ill-fated and costly war.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Agent-Orange-wreath-horizontal-1024x585.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

The new contract was awarded on Jan. 1 and will cover a term of 10 years. As Belton Chalets held the previous contract, agency officials said in a press release that the public is not expected to experience any interruptions in service.
“Belton Chalets, Inc. has provided park visitors with exceptional and unique services at Granite Park and Sperry chalets for years,” Dave Roemer, Glacier Park superintendent, said in a statement. “We know that their passion for the chalets and their experience will serve the public and the park well.”
Granite Park Chalet and Sperry Chalet are two iconic backcountry lodges in Glacier, remnants of what used to be a system of nine Swiss-style chalets connected by trails built by the Great Northern Railroad.
The other chalets were destroyed by natural disasters or by park officials.
(Belton Chalet, a separate lodge outside of the park in West Glacier, is operated by a different concessioner.)
In 2017, a fire burning up the Sprague Creek Valley torched Sperry Chalet and gutted the 104-year-old dormitory. It was rebuilt over two years — a $12 million reconstruction effort that was supported by all three members of Montana’s then-congressional delegation, and former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a native of nearby Whitefish, helping make it a national priority.
Belton Chalets, Inc has a long history stewarding the park’s backcountry chalets. The family-run company operated the chalets from 1954-1992, Granite Park Chalet from 1996-97, Sperry Chalet 1999-2004 and both chalets again since 2005, according to the NPS.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GranitePark_1.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo and seal courtesy of the Iowa Judicial Branch)The Iowa Supreme Court says Iowans who are given court-appointed attorneys should not have to pay legal fees if the criminal charges against them are dismissed.
Friday’s ruling by the court stems from a case involving Ronald Pagliai, who was facing criminal charges related to allegations of shoplifting when he requested and was granted a court-appointed attorney. Two of the charges were later dropped after Pagliai agreed to plead guilty in two separate cases. He later argued that he shouldn’t have to reimburse the state of the cost of his defense in the cases that were dropped by prosecutors.
As part of Pagliai’s plea deal, the state had agreed to dismiss the two charges with the understanding that Pagliai would pay the costs in the dismissed cases, which included $329.85 to reimburse the state’s indigent defense fund, plus $160 in filing fees.

Pagliai then challenged the district court’s authority to assess costs against a defendant for charges the court had agreed to dismiss.
In its ruling, the Iowa Supreme Court found that the district court had no statutory authority to dispose of the cases by ordering Pagliai to pay defense costs in dismissed cases. It then remanded the matter to district court, giving the state two options as to how the case can proceed: The state can vacate only the order assessing fees and costs to Pagliai, or it can vacate the entire plea bargain, the resulting convictions, the sentences, and the order for payment.
The justices noted that if the state opts to reinstate the charges that had been dismissed as part of a previously agreed-to plea deal, if can then file “any additional charges supported by the available evidence.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa was among the public-interest groups that filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing that defendants shouldn’t foot the bill for legal fees when the state agrees to dismiss charges.
Alex Kornya, director of litigation for the Legal Aid Justice Center and cooperating attorney for the ACLU of Iowa in the case, said that while the court’s decision provides relief for Iowans moving forward, it also creates a dilemma for Iowans who may open themselves to additional charges by challenging the validity of their own court-ordered payments.
“That basic problem is that thousands of Iowans already, collectively, owe millions of dollars in cases, even though they were convicted of no crime,” he said. “It could present a difficult choice regarding the risk of the prosecution being able to refile charges. Realistically, that may prevent many people who have had debt assessed in the past from being able to take advantage of the court’s decision today.”

The Rebels star quarterback just finished his fifth year of college football in a 31-27 loss to Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals on Thursday night.
He had planned to return to Ole Miss for one more year if the waiver was approved.
The NCAA said Ole Miss and Ferris State failed to provide adequate medical documentation to back up the request.
Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said his school will appeal the ruling.
“We are disappointed with today’s announcement by the NCAA and plan to appeal the decision to the Committee level,” Carter said in a social media post, in which he included the flag of Trinidad and Tobago. “Additionally, we will continue to work in conjunction with Trinidad’s representatives in other avenues of support.”
Tom Mars, who is an attorney for Chambliss, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the NCAA’s decision.
“The last time I checked, however, the only score that matters is the one at the end of the fourth quarter,” Mars said.

“I understand that Ole Miss will file an appeal with the NCAA. However, there’s now an opportunity to move this case to a level playing field where Trinidad’s rights will be determined by the Mississippi judiciary instead of some bureaucrats in Indianapolis who couldn’t care less about the law or doing the right thing,” Mars said. “Whether to pursue that course of action is a decision only Trinidad and his parents can make.”
After taking a redshirt his first season at Ferris State in 2021-22, Chambliss was held out in his second season for medical reasons. He played two more seasons at the Division II school, leading the Bulldogs to a national championship before transferring to Ole Miss before the start of this season. Ole Miss filed the waiver request with the NCAA in November.
Chambliss completed 294 of 445 passes (66.1%) for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and three interceptions for Ole Miss (13-2), which set a school record for wins, including two after making the College Football Playoff for the first time. He ran for 527 yards and eight more TDs.
The NCAA said in its denial statement that approval of such waivers requires schools to submit medical documentation from a treating physician at the time of a student’s incapacitating injury or illness.
“The documents provided by Ole Miss and the student’s prior school include a physician’s note from a December 2022 visit, which stated the student-athlete was ‘doing very well’ since he was seen in August 2022,” the NCAA said. “Additionally, the student-athlete’s prior school indicated it had no documentation on medical treatment, injury reports or medical conditions involving the student-athlete during that time frame and cited ‘developmental needs and our team’s competitive circumstances’ as its reason the student-athlete did not play in the 2022-23 season.”
The NCAA noted that it initially provided a verbal denial on Dec. 8, which was 12 days before Ole Miss beat Tulane at home in the program’s first CFP game.
“To receive a clock extension, a student-athlete must have been denied two seasons of competition for reasons beyond the student’s or school’s control, and a ‘redshirt’ year can be used only once,” the statement reads. “One of the rules being cited publicly (Bylaw 12.6.4.2.2) is not the correct rule for the type of waiver requested by the school.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/08204555/AP26009092149854.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

Simultaneously, an influx of funding and research is attempting to reverse wild turkey losses. 
The latest came recently when the Kansas state chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation approved more than $126,000 for habitat enhancement and hunting education projects. The federation promised an additional $730,000.
The funds will be dispersed across Kansas to boost invasive species removal efforts, a Boy Scout habitat project, turkey ecology and toxicology research at Kansas State University, scholarships, sponsorships and a habitat specialist position. The funding is fueled by volunteers who raise money at banquets and fundraisers, according to a Tuesday news release.
Annie Farrell, the federation’s district biologist for Kansas and three other states, commended the volunteers.
“These volunteers are our boots on the ground, putting their hard-earned dollars back on the landscape to support critical projects that will greatly benefit the wild turkey,” she said. “Thanks to their dedication, it’s going to be a great year for conservation in Kansas.”
The wild turkey encompasses five subspecies, including the Eastern and the Rio Grande, which are found in Kansas along with a hybrid of the two subspecies. Wild turkey can be found in nearly every county in Kansas.
The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks suspended the fall wild turkey hunting season in 2023 after years of restrictions.
Still, 13,862 turkeys were hunted and harvested in 2025, according to the department’s annual turkey harvest report.
In 2023, K-State received almost $2 million to conduct wild turkey research to deduce the root cause of the more than 40% decline since 2008.
Wild turkey populations were gravely diminished in the early 20th century because of human activity resulting in overhunting and habitat loss, according to the National Audubon Society.
The society’s annual Christmas Bird Count shows a steady increase in observations of wild turkey in Kansas beginning in the 1960s, when they were reintroduced into the state. Observations peaked in 2011 and have since declined to levels comparable to those of more than two decades ago.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/usfws-rio-grande-wild-turkey-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

Steny Hoyer's announcement that he will not seek reelection to the 5th District seat that he has held for the last 45 years is expected to make an already crowded race more crowded. Much more crowded.,"Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), then House majority leader, at a Maryland Democratic Party luncheon in Annapolis in 2020 -- when he was almost 40 years into his congressional tenure. (Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Rep. Steny Hoyer’s announcement that he will not seek reelection to the 5th District seat that he has held for the last 45 years is expected to make an already crowded race more crowded. Much more crowded.
“It will probably unleash a bit of a free-for-all among folks who see that open seat now and would like to have a shot at serving in Congress – knowing that it would probably, if they win, be a safe seat for them for as long as they want to hold onto it,” said Todd Eberly, a professor of political science and public policy at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, where Hoyer serves on the Board of Trustees.
Even before Hoyer bowed out, nine people had filed to run in the 5th District, a Southern Maryland district that includes parts of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties. As of Friday, there were five Democrats, two unaffiliated candidates and one Republican signed up for the seat, according to the state Board of Elections. A second Republican candidate who filed in April withdrew in October.
A number of notable elected officials may also get into the race. Prince George’s Democratic Dels. Adrian Boafo and Nicole Williams and Bowie Mayor Tim Adams have all been mentioned as possible candidates, should the seat come open, and there are likely others.
Besides getting more choices, 5th District voters — Democrats, at least — will also likely get a broader range of choices as Hoyer, a long a centrist Democrat, makes room for younger and probably more progressive candidates, experts say.
David Karol, an associate professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, College Park said Hoyer was a mainstream Democrat who wanted to remain appealing to centrists. But the district has changed, Karol said, with larger numbers of minority voters, as has Washington, where increased political polarization is driving candidates farther to the right and left.
“His positioning reflected the environment in which he came up politically, and that was the way it was into his 40s and even early 50s,” Karol said. “But I think that his successor is likely to be African American, and not likely to have centrist leanings.”
‘We must respect and love one another’: Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring

Hoyer’s colleague, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) agreed.
“He almost certainly is going to be replaced by somebody more progressive than he is,” Raskin said. “Steny is definitely more conservative than the center of gravity within the Democratic caucus now. I mean, he is the product of a different political generation.”
While Hoyer’s successor may be ideologically distinct, that candidate would do well to follow Hoyer’s model of community service, Raskin said.
“In fairness to Steny, I think that they will certainly try to emulate his record of being connected to the community, and committed to strong constituent service,” Raskin said.
Even though it’s Hoyer’s seat, leading Democrats in Congress may not try to tip the scales in favor of one candidate, because the seat is in a safe district, Karol said. In the 2024 election, there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in the district, according to a board of elections report.
“In some cases, the party establishment, such as it is, tries to consolidate around one person, but that often happens when it’s a competitive district and they’re trying to get the candidate who can beat the other side and hold the seat. That’s not really a concern here,” Karol said.
Two Democratic challengers from Anne Arundel County – Quincy Bareebe and Harry Jarin, both of whom have been running since October – released statements Thursday thanking Hoyer for his decades of service in Congress.
“Congressman Hoyer’s retirement marks the close of a historic chapter in Maryland’s public life,” said Bareebe, who runs a caregiving and assisted living businesses, and was one of three Hoyer challengers in 2024. “I am deeply thankful for his decades of commitment to our communities and for the example he has set for all who believe public service is about building a better future together.”
Jarin, 36, a volunteer firefighter, echoed those statements in an interview Thursday afternoon, crediting Hoyer for making a “very tough decision to pass the reins to a new generation.” But Jarin focused mostly on improvements needed in the Democratic Party as a whole, such as choosing candidates who don’t operate the same way as Hoyer.
“Our old way of doing politics, that is what created the conditions for a fascist movement to gain power in this country,” Jarin said. “The ideal that we would just try to hit the reset button and reset American politics back to the way we operated 10 or 20 years ago, frankly that’s insane. We need a very different path forward.”
‘There’s no one that doesn’t love Steny’; official Maryland reacts to Hoyer’s retirement

 
Among other potential contenders, Williams told Maryland Matters on Wednesday night that she’s giving “strong consideration” to a run, before thanking Hoyer for “all of his years of service to Prince George’s County, to the 5th Congressional District, to the state of Maryland and really to the nation. He is going to leave big shoes for us to fill.”
Boafo worked several years ago as Hoyer’s campaign manager, one of many current Democratic officials in the state who worked for Hoyer during his 60 years in elected office.
“I saw up close his distinct warmth toward everyone he encountered, his dedication to fighting for what’s right, and inimitable ability to assess the toughest challenges and win for the people,” Boafo said in a statement. “Maryland and this country is better because of Steny Hoyer’s service. May God bless his well-earned retirement.”
As for whom Hoyer might support to replace him, he’s not saying right now.
“I have some thoughts, but I’m not going to discuss them today,” he said. “We’ll see who’s running.
“There’s obviously going to be people who are thinking about running, who have been very close to me and have been very helpful to me through the years. I’ll take a look,” Hoyer said. “At some point in time, I may tell my friends and neighbors, i.e. their future constituents, who I think would be good to follow in my footsteps.”

Dec. 16, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFollowing the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to sign off on a set of contracts for DTE Energy to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center in Saline Township, Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of environmental and consumer advocacy groups have each filed a petition asking regulators to rehear the case. 
During its Dec. 18 meeting, the public service commission granted DTE’s request for ex parte approval, allowing the contracts to move forward without intervention from outside organizations, which would be able to conduct legal discovery and file testimony on the contracts. 
Ahead of the meeting, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and the coalition, made up of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, advocated heavily for a contested case on the matter, arguing that it would allow intervenors to ensure that DTE customers are protected from concerns like increased energy rates due to heavy energy demand from the facility.
While the Commission approved both contracts, that approval hinges on several conditions, including requirements for DTE to update its tariff  structure for large-energy load customers, like data centers, and file an amended renewable energy plan to include a comparison of the resources it needs to meet the state’s requirement to provide 100% clean energy by 2040, both with and without the data center’s energy load.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The commission set a 30-day deadline for DTE to agree to the terms laid out in the Dec. 18 order.
In a statement released Friday, Nessel reiterated her disappointment in the commission’s decision to “fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” criticizing the heavy redactions of the publicly available copies of the contracts.
“This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect,” Nessel said. 
Nessel’s petition for a rehearing challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts without a contested hearing. The petition also raises questions on how the conditions set by the commission would prevent DTE from passing along costs to serve the data center, which is under development by tech giant Oracle and data center developer Related Digital for use by ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. 
Matt Helms, the commission’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the body looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for a rehearing, but denied any claims that they had not sufficiently reviewed the contracts. 
The commission’s staff thoroughly reviewed unredacted contracts to ensure customers are protected, Helms said.
“The Commission’s order in this case recognizes the utility’s obligation to serve this customer under Michigan law while requiring the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country – protections that would not be available under existing tariffs without the Commission’s approval of these contracts,” Helms said. 
Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan raised their own questions on how the conditions laid out by the commission would protect customers from increased energy rates, alongside other concerns, like how the conditions on the contracts will be enforced.
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry argued that the contracts protect their customers from subsidizing the data center’s energy rate. The company will continue to follow the regulatory process, Lowry said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire state lawmakers passed two bills related to abortion this week: one to ensure that a health care provider who conscientiously objects to abortion can keep their job if they refuse to aid in an abortion, and another that criminalizes driving a minor to an abortion appointment.
House Bill 232, which was passed by the House Thursday, would enshrine into law the right for a provider to conscientiously object to participating in an abortion. It would empower any provider who is discriminated against by their employer for not participating in an abortion to sue for damages. And it would require employers to place an 8½-by-11-inch poster in the workplace entitled “Freedom of Conscience for Health Care Providers” that outlines employees’ rights not to participate in abortions. The law would not apply to employees of health care institutions that provide abortion as a major part of its services or employees who are the only health care provider present in an emergency situation.
Abortion has been legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in New Hampshire since 2021. Republican leaders, who control the state House and Senate, and governor’s office, promised on the campaign trail they would not expand that restriction. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, in her inaugural address in 2025, promised to veto any legislation to further restrict abortion.
On the House floor Thursday, Katy Peternel, a Wolfeboro Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, argued the legislation wasn’t an abortion restriction, but rather simply a measure to “protect health care professionals from being forced to participate in the ending of a human life.” She said the bill is important to “(allow) New Hampshire to attract providers who value motherhood and family.”
Peternel argued that “for many health care providers, abortion represents the deliberate taking of human life, an unnatural violent separation of unborn children from their mother. … No one should have to choose between their profession and moral integrity.”
Peternel has long been a vocal proponent of strengthening abortion restrictions. In early 2025, she unsuccessfully attempted to ban abortions after 15 weeks. She backed away and withdrew that bill before it was given a floor vote.
“This bill does not ban or restrict access to abortion,” Peternel said Thursday about HB 232. “It simply brings New Hampshire in line with 47 other states with conscience clauses.”
Democrats didn’t buy that argument.
“Make no mistake about it,” Rep. Zoe Manos, a Stratham Democrat, said. “This is an anti-abortion bill.”
Manos argued that while Republicans claim the bill is about “a health care provider’s right of conscience,” it is actually an effort to allow “someone to turn a patient away from accessing abortion.” She alleged that the bill would allow anyone working in a facility, even a receptionist, to refuse to participate in an abortion. “Should a receptionist have the power to deny health care to patients in New Hampshire?” she asked.
The House voted, 184-164, to approve the bill. All but six Republicans voted for it, while all but one Democrat voted against it. The bill will now be considered by the Senate. If the Senate follows suit, the bill will go to the governor’s desk for final approval.
Meanwhile, the Senate also approved an abortion-related bill on Wednesday. House Bill 191 seeks to make helping a minor travel to receive an abortion — or any other procedure — without parental permission illegal.
The bill has already passed the House. In its original form, the legislation was focused entirely on abortion. However, it was subsequently amended in the House to outlaw transporting a minor for any procedure. First offenses of this bill would result in a misdemeanor and a third offense would be a felony. In March, the bill was passed by the House, 180-164, with the broader language.
Wednesday’s bill similarly fell upon party lines during debate.
Sen. Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, called the bill “duplicative,” noting that state law already requires parental consent for a child to receive an abortion. She also argued the bill — having been expanded to all surgical procedures — could criminalize transporting children to doctor’s appointments as routine as the removal of wisdom teeth. 
“If I ask my neighbor, my sister, my mother to take my son to the dentist, is that explicit or implicit consent?” Reardon said. “It’s debatable. It’s a gamble. And a criminal misdemeanor is the price for that.”
She called it “draconian, punitive, and unnecessary when the Legislature has previously crafted a solution to this issue.”
The Senate voted, 16-8, along party lines to approve the bill. Before passing it, the Senate amended the bill. Senators changed the bill text from “a surgical procedure for the minor” to “a surgical procedure for the minor or a termination of the minor’s pregnancy.” They also removed a requirement the House implemented for notarized consent, changing it to simply written consent. The bill will now return to the House for the amendment to be considered.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/statehousesnow-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, was a poet and a mother of 3. She moved to the city with her wife and 6-year-old son almost a year ago.
Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, told the Washington Post that they had stopped to support neighbors when she was shot by the ICE agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune. 
“On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns,” Rebecca Good said in a statement to the Post and other media outlets on Friday.
“We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,” the statement continues. “Renee lived this belief every day. She is pure love. She is pure joy. She is pure sunshine.”
Renee Good, 37, was a mother to a 15-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 12 and 6, her first husband told the Post. Online records and interviews with media outlets from family and friends paint her as a caring person and an avid writer who enjoyed movies, making art, singing and playing guitar. Her first husband described her as a devoted Christian to the Post.
She studied creative writing at Old Virginia University in Norfolk, Va., graduating in December 2020. She won an undergraduate poetry prize in 2020 for her poem “On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs,” which the contest judge described as “a meditation that leads the reader into the unknown.”
“May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,” university president Brian O. Hemphill said in a statement. “My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.”
She was originally from Colorado Springs, Colo. She lived in Kansas City, Mo., with her wife before moving to Minnesota. Their former neighbor in Kansas City told the Post that the couple said they wanted to move out of the red state after President Donald Trump was elected in 2024.
Her second husband, Tim Macklin, died in 2023 and was a military veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, reported the Post. He was also a comedian with whom she co-hosted a podcast, according to a post on the Old Virginia University English department Facebook page.
A faculty member who taught her, Kent Wascom, described her to the Post as a poet who was focused on improving her fiction writing and who, unlike peers, never talked about politics.
“She was kind and talented, a working class mom who put herself through school despite circumstances that would’ve crumpled the pathetic rich boy politicians who sadistically abetted her murder,” Wascom said in an X post.
Good described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom and sh*tty guitar strummer from Colorado” who is “experiencing Minneapolis” on what appears to be her now-private Instagram page.

The Office of Childhood in the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which found it could not access the funds earlier this week, had been unable to explain the delay to child care providers because it had not received communication from the federal government before Thursday evening.
“We know how important these payments are to providers, and this is our utmost priority,” said Office of Childhood Assistant Commissioner Deidre Anderson-Barbee in the press release.
The department submitted a “comprehensive breakdown” Friday morning to meet the requirements of a federal initiative called “Defend the Spend,” its spokesman told The Independent. Defend the Spend, a system created by the now-dissolved Department of Government Efficiency, requires recipients of federal funds to justify each transaction before they can receive payment.
Although the state office has submitted the required documentation, child care providers still don’t know when they can expect to receive payment. 
Missouri waiting on $25.7 million payment from feds to reimburse child care providers

Lisa Scheer, director of Baden Christian Child Care in St. Louis, told The Independent that the message from the state office brings little relief.
“It’s an answer, but it’s not an answer anyone wants to hear,” Scheer said. “To be honest, there’s not going to be an answer until they say, ‘We’re paying you.”
Scheer said her child care center relies heavily on the federal funds because each of the 45 children the center serves participates in the subsidy program. Families in Missouri must earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify.
“Our families really rely on our services for food, for safety,” Scheer said. “We provide area transportation and really just a safe haven for our neighborhood and community.”
U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill on Dec. 30 announced in a social media post that all states would be required to justify their child care expenses in order to access support from the federal Child Care and Development Fund.
On Monday the federal department froze child care payments to five states — all with Democrat-led governments.
The state’s Office of Childhood said Friday that the federal request for information about Missouri’s child care subsidy program indicates “Missouri child care funds have not been frozen.”
Before that communication, the cause of the delay wasn’t clear. 
Casey Hanson, deputy director of Kids Win Missouri, told The Independent that the uncertainty has made the funding disruption more painful for child care providers who operate on very tight margins.
In a meeting of around 160 providers Wednesday, Hanson said, many were “frustrated and upset.”
Some providers who mostly serve families who receive subsidies “are at a point to be turning [those families] away, especially if they don’t have reserves, and a lot of small providers really don’t,” Hanson said.
Scheer, who was in the meeting, said she’s trying to delay costs where she can. She agreed with her husband that she won’t draw a paycheck until federal funding comes through.  But she realizes her employees, who are mostly single women, can’t do that.
While Scheer said she is committed to keeping her doors open, she’s not sure how long the center would be able to operate without subsidy payments.
“It’s trying to make sure my employees’ needs are met so that they can still show up for children, so children’s needs are met, so that parents can still go to work and be parents for their children,” Scheer said.
“It’s just a lot of unknown.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8677-1024x615.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 17:12:39.732563

(Photo courtesy DWS)Homeless shelters across the state received funding to keep people warm amid a statewide cold snap thanks to a first-ever, state-funded grant program from the new Office of Housing. 
The statewide Office of Housing emerged as one of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s priorities during the legislative session last year. The small team within the state’s Department of Workforce Solutions is tasked with overseeing the allocation of more than $100 million on a statewide strategy for affordable housing and homelessness prevention measures, including about $20 million the Legislature approved specifically for “anti-homelessness initiatives.”
That’s the fund where the office found $820,000 to provide to several dozen statewide facilities, including transitional living centers, domestic violence shelters and others, to increase their capacity and warmth this winter, DWS Secretary Sarita Nair told Source New Mexico on Friday. 
Individual shelters typically rely on local governments or private contributions to keep unhoused people warm during the winter months. And they often come up short funding-wise, according to a survey of housing nonprofit organizations the Office of Housing conducted shortly after launching last year, Nair said.

“This hasn’t been a role that the state’s played historically,” Nair said of funding the warming centers. “But it has always been a challenge for a lot of these shelters to be able to expand for the additional demand they see in the winter.”
Shelters that applied for the funding received up to $20,000 grants they could use on supplies like cots, portable heaters or blankets and generally to increase the number of people they’re able keep warm during the winter. 
“We heard from some folks that, ‘This is the first time that we’ve been able to heat every room in our shelter,’” Nair said. “Really basic things, but that’s how you expand the capacity.”
A news release from the office said the funding has already proven particularly useful in rural areas, where “providers reported improved building heating, increased street outreach efforts, expanded bed capacity, and the ability to offer extended overnight hours with hot meals.” 
Nair also said the Office of Housing is already preparing to execute a similar grant funding round to help shelters keep unhoused people from overheating during the summer months. 
“We know that cooling centers are becoming equally important,” she said. “And so we would love to do another round of that, if we get more funding.”

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, says the president does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze funding approved by Congress for the states. It marks Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s 50th legal challenge to Trump administration policies.

Other attorneys general on the call included Rob Bonta of California, Letitia James of New York, Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Kwame Raoul of Illinois.
The administration’s targeting of the five states is “pure partisan politics,” Bonta said. James said the administration froze the funding based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.
“This unlawful funding freeze is about one thing: Punishing Democratic states that oppose the president,” James said. 
The lawsuit asks the court to declare the freeze unconstitutional and stop the federal government from implementing it.
“We believe that if we can’t persuade the Trump administration to do what is right and to follow the law, we believe the courts will give relief to the people who need it so desperately,” Ellison said. “One thing is abundantly clear: Donald Trump wants to use the mechanism of government to punish people and states that he doesn’t like.”
The administration’s move to freeze funding based on suspicion of fraud is not based on the results of any investigations, Ellison said, and the president has not looked at ways the states have held people accountable for trying to defraud the affected programs. 
Minnesota has experienced widespread fraud cases involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs.
Raoul said the funding freeze has nothing to do with fraud and that his office “regularly works to investigate and prosecute individuals who defraud Illinois taxpayers.” 
“If the President was serious about rooting out fraud, his administration would be investing more resources in partnering with states and supporting states’ efforts to root out fraud and abuse,” Raoul said. 
Colorado receives about $136 million in block funding for TANF, administered through Colorado Works, every year. In 2024, a Colorado family of three received a maximum monthly TANF benefit of $585, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty. Last year, the state was allocated about $140 million in federal funds to pay for care for children in low-income families, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Two New Jersey legislative panels pushed through over $128 million in proposed new spending Thursday night without explanation or public comment, prompting outcry from good government advocates who warned that such secrecy erodes the public’s trust.
Details of the new spending were posted online Friday midday, long after the Senate’s budget and appropriations committee approved it in the last two minutes of a six-hour hearing at Trenton’s Statehouse. The vote on the bill came after most spectators — and even some committee members — had left for the night.
The Assembly’s appropriations committee also approved the bill Thursday, long after nightfall near the end of its eight-hour meeting.
The bill verbiage offers brief, vague descriptions of 18 items of proposed spending. They include funding for a state supercomputer, World Cup promotions, and capital improvements at county buildings, schools, and a hospital.

Peter Chen, a senior analyst with progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, was at the Senate hearing and stood to question the spending, but Sen. Paul Sarlo, the committee’s chair, called for a vote without allowing public comment.
“This is, unfortunately, part of a pattern of a lack of transparency around the budget and around how the state spends the public’s funds,” Chen said Friday. “Each of these programs might be a good idea, but I certainly have questions about $25 million for a supercomputer and a sort of blanket dollar amount for World Cup preparations. I think the public should have a right to ask questions about and see details on these kinds of proposals before they’re voted on.”
Sarlo, before the vote, described the budget bill as supplemental appropriations that were a mix of spending legislators approved in recent weeks, spending that Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration requested, and “let’s call it repairs or corrections that were made as part of the budget process.”
Stella Porter, a Murphy spokeswoman, declined to comment.
In both committees, the Democrats supported the bill, while Republicans voted against it. The bill was sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the lower chamber’s Democratic budget officer.
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) voted against the bill. He told the New Jersey Monitor Friday that both the process and the extra spending are “nuts.”
“There’s no reason to add $128 million in spending — ever, quite frankly, during the course of the year. It’s just all political giveaways. What about the other 500 good causes out there? Why these 18?” O’Scanlon said. “We’ve been hearing about the looming Medicaid cuts that we’re going to have to deal with. Why isn’t this money going to that, if we have it? It’s ridiculous.”
The proposed new spending includes:

$38 million in capital improvements at the Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus ($12 million); the Hudson County Schools of Technology ($10 million); Kean University ($5 million); the Mercer County Connection building in Hamilton ($2 million); and unspecified capital improvements in Union County ($9 million).
$26 million to the state Economic Development Authority for events marketing, $20 million of which will go to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Host Committee to promote statewide tourism. First lady Tammy Murphy is chair of the committee’s board of directors.
$25 million for an “AI Supercomputer Initiative,” in which a university would host “a new state-of-the-art supercomputer.”
$15 million for a new regional county jail in Camden County ($13 million) and for emergency vehicles and communications upgrades in Gloucester and Salem counties ($2 million).
$10 million in unspecified counties “to achieve efficiencies and future cost savings in the provision of services at the local level.”
$5 million for the state Office of the Food Security Advocate to research food insecurity and fund grants and partnerships to reduce hunger.
$4 million for the Middlesex County Network Operations Center.
$2 million for homelessness services in Burlington County.
$1.5 million for the Old Barracks Museum in Trenton.
$1 million to fund transportation for special-needs adults for the Larc Norcross School in Bellmawr.

The new spending comes six months after New Jersey lawmakers approved a record-high $58.8 billion budget that included a number of cuts and controversial diversions that have spurred ongoing protests and calls for restored funding. That budget also included over $700 million for lawmakers’ pet projects that critics have condemned as pork spending, even though Murphy had warned federal cuts and other budget stressors would require “hard decisions.”
O’Scanlon, as the Senate Republicans’ budget officer, has long railed against Legislature’s budget process, in which lawmakers are asked to vote on a lengthy annual budget at the end of June, just hours after they first see it. The criticism is not just partisan, with advocates long calling for more transparency too.
Thursday’s spending bill was just one of many added at the last-minute to both committees’ agendas, which O’Scanlon also blasted as an “irresponsible” failure of transparency.
“Taxpayers deserve far better than this broken process,” he said.

The bill will be up for a vote before both full chambers Monday, the final voting sessions of the current legislative session. Murphy then must sign it for it to become law. His last day as governor is Jan. 20.

Polk, Woodbury, Muscatine and other Iowa counties have been sued by numerous jail inmates in recent months, each alleging they’ve been unlawfully detained in county jails by ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
An exact count of all the lawsuits against Iowa jails is difficult to calculate given the fact that Iowa’s county jails typically don’t disclose the names of inmates who are being held at the direction of ICE. In addition, public access to the federal court records related to those detentions is tightly restricted.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the available records show Polk County, ICE and DHS are named as defendants in at least three additional cases recently filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Lt. Mark Chance of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 68 of the 993 inmates now housed at the Polk County Jail are detainees of DHS or ICE.
Nationally and in Iowa, many of the lawsuits surrounding ICE detainees involve the Trump administration’s six-month-old effort to expand its “mandatory detention” policy. Under that policy, ICE is holding people in jail indefinitely as their immigration cases proceed, while arguing those individuals are not entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release on bond.
Politico recently reported that more than 300 federal judges, including appointees of every president since Ronald Reagan, have rejected the administration’s “mandatory detention” theory in more than 1,600 cases.
The courts’ near-universal rejection of the administration’s position has not prevented the U.S. Department of Justice from continuing to use that rationale to jail people indefinitely. In fact, the DOJ recently appealed one judge’s ruling against ICE after it resulted in a woman’s release from the Muscatine County Jail.
Polk County man detained during traffic stop
One of the newly filed cases involves Ulises Ramirez Cruz, who sued Polk County and ICE over his detention and the refusal of the immigration courts to provide him with a hearing at which he could argue for his release on bond.
Court records indicate Ramirez Cruz has lived in Iowa for five years. He alleges that ICE agents — identified in court records only as T. Staudinger, Scroggins, Palmer and Hanson — waited outside his house on Nov. 7, 2025, and then pulled him over after he left the house, got into his car and drove away.
U.S. Attorney David Waterman argued in court that Ramirez Cruz is not entitled to a bond hearing and is subject to mandatory detention. In a recent ruling against the government, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher noted he has rejected the DOJ’s arguments in at least three other cases that have come before him, and that judges around the country have “overwhelmingly” issued similar decisions.
Locher’s order directs the immigration court to provide Ramirez Cruz with an opportunity to argue for his release on bond while the underlying immigration case proceeds.
‘Punitive detention’ alleged in Polk County case 
The second recent case involves a Polk County Jail inmate, Luis Pedroso, a citizen of Cuba who has been in the United States for four and a half years. Pedroso has applied for status as a legal permanent resident of the United States, but as part of the approval process, he must prove he’s not ineligible on public-health grounds, which would involve a physical examination to rule out drug abuse and communicable diseases.
Under federal regulations, that examination must be provided by a physician selected by or approved by immigration authorities. Attorneys for Pedroso argue that the jail, Polk County Health Department and ICE are all unwilling or unable to provide Pedroso with a physician so the examination can be conducted. ICE is also unwilling to transfer Pedroso to a different jail so the examination can take place, they allege.
Pedroso’s attorneys claim ICE and the county have, in effect, denied Pedroso his status as a legal permanent resident and violated his right to due process.
“Keeping Pedroso in detention for the purpose of adjudicating his claim in immigration court transforms his detention into a punitive detention intending to punish him for the fact that he is eligible for legal permanent residency,” the lawsuit alleges.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response.
U.S. resident for 35 years, in jail for four months 
A third lawsuit involving the Polk County Jail revolves around Amir Rahimi of Centerville, a native of Iran who has lived in the United States for 35 years.
In his lawsuit against the county, ICE and DHS, Rahimi alleges he has been married to a native-born U.S. citizen for 33 years, with whom he has three children. The couple’s eldest son is in the U.S. Air Force and is currently deployed overseas, the lawsuit claims.
Rahimi alleges he was detained by federal agents when he stopped at an ICE office for a routine, scheduled appointment on July 22, 2025. At the time, he claims, ICE gave no reason for his detention except to tell him they were currently “seeking a third country for your removal” — suggesting the agency’s plan is to deport him not to Iran, but to some other country.
“After four months of detention, the legal justification for his detention still remains unclear and he has been provided with no explanation of the change in his circumstances that resulted in the deprivation of his liberty,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing Rahimi’s continued detention, citing alleged violations of Rahimi’s due process rights and the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.
Feds appeal ruling in Muscatine County case 
In addition to the newly filed lawsuits, a fourth lawsuit involving the Muscatine County Jail continues to move forward despite a judge’s ruling in the case in early November.
That case centers on Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.
Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.
On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail. An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing.
Reyes sued in U.S. District Court, and on Nov. 3, 2025, Judge Locher ruled in her favor, noting that the  majority of courts around the nation have rejected the administration’s interpretation of the law as requiring mandatory detention.
Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.
In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher wrote that “ICE itself obviously did not believe she was subject to mandatory detention” when they released her on how own recognizance in September 2023 and again in February 2025.
Court records indicate Reyes was granted bond after a hearing on Nov. 7, 2025, and was released from custody three days later on a $6,000 bond.
Despite Locher’s ruling and Reyes’ subsequent release, the U.S. Department of Justice is now appealing Locher’s ruling.

Community Colleges for Iowa will ask for additional funding and Last-Dollar Scholarship changes in the upcoming legislative session. (Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)With Iowa’s community college system set to celebrate 60 years of serving students, its leaders are getting ready to work with the Iowa Legislature to potentially implement new degree programs and curriculum.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said she agrees with lawmakers that community colleges are “one of Iowa’s best kept secrets,” and she hopes community colleges can receive the additional funding and program support to expand affordability and access for high school, college-age and adult learners.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia — chairs of the Iowa House Higher Education Committee and the Iowa Senate Education Committee, respectively — have said that community colleges will be a focus of the upcoming legislative session. Evans called community colleges one of Iowa’s “hidden gems” that the state needs to do a better job of promoting.
The Iowa Legislature created the statewide community college system 60 years ago this year, Shields said, and it has been a “national model” ever since.

“I just want people to know how much is available to them, affordably and locally, and our folks are so humble, so it is hard for me to get community college folks to brag on themselves and really talk about the great things that are available,” Shields said. “So to hear a legislator recognizing that is wonderful, and we want to continue to promote this incredible resource.”
New degrees, changing curriculum on the table this session
Community colleges will be asking for a $12 million increase in state funding for the next fiscal year, Shields said, mainly to keep up with increasing costs of goods and services and to keep pay and benefits competitive. Like the previous year, when community colleges implemented a funding formula designed and approved by college presidents to level out the institutions receiving more or less per-student funding, this additional funding will also further that process.
Some of those funds would also go toward implementing bachelor’s degree programs at community colleges, Shields said — if the Legislature decides to turn that potential into a reality.
Community Colleges for Iowa released a report in October 2025 exploring other states’ efforts to incorporate baccalaureate degrees into their academic offerings and what would be needed for Iowa to do the same, after prompting from Iowa lawmakers in the previous legislative session. Collins said implementing new community college degree programs will be a priority this session, but Shields said the usual state funding request won’t cover the costs entirely.
In addition to general state aid, Shields said Community Colleges for Iowa plans to request a $20 million fund for the creation of baccalaureate degrees at community colleges. The money will act as startup funding for these programs.
“That’s one of the things that we learned from other states, is that while the programs can be self-sustaining, it’s difficult to get them off the ground without initial funding to cover the costs related to hiring new faculty, training them, equipment, before the tuition is coming in the door,” Shields said.
Shields said introducing new kinds of degrees to community colleges wouldn’t change their collective mission so much as build upon it. The system’s mission is focused on workforce, credentials and degrees, as well as meeting unmet needs in local areas.
With 15 community colleges operating in more than 100 locations across Iowa and offering a more affordable education than public and some private universities, Shields said if community colleges can identify the needs of their local communities and develop bachelor’s degree programs to address them, these institutions “are uniquely positioned” to meet needs based on both affordability and geographical accessibility.
“Looking at where there are people who aren’t getting a bachelor’s degree now, but could and would if it was offered at their local community college, that’s the population that I know the Legislature will be considering, and we’re excited about this conversation,” Shields said.
Another priority Collins has discussed is further attempts to change core curriculum requirements at public universities, which he pointed out would impact community colleges as well. While it depends on the college, Shields said around half of community college students transfer to a four-year institution, and any changes community colleges would need to make to curriculum to keep the transfer process smooth and seamless just depends on what the to-be-introduced legislation targets.
Community colleges are also hoping to make changes to the Last-Dollar Scholarship Program, a scholarship fund which Shields said has been underspent, especially as the list of career fields included in the scholarship has been limited.
The Last-Dollar Scholarship Program provides eligible students attending a community college with enough money to fill any gaps left between their financial aid and the cost of tuition and fees. The Iowa Workforce Development Board voted in spring 2025 to limit the number of job fields that students must enroll in a program related to in order to receive Last-Dollar Scholarship funding, a decision that eliminated careers in law enforcement, medical and dental assisting, wastewater and more.
Shields said the program has been underspent the last couple of years, due to an income cap implemented a few years ago and what jobs were eligible for the program, and the new limitations on eligible job fields will “constrict” the money that’s supposed to be going to students even more.
“We’re looking for some legislative changes to expand that so the funds are getting to the students that need it,” Shields said.
Proposed legislation to address college transfers, career programs
One bill has already been filed ahead of the Jan. 12 start of the session, which would make changes to requirements for career academy courses, the articulation agreement between community colleges and state universities and programming aimed at helping high school students afford a concurrent education.
The proposed legislation, if adopted, would require career academies to offer at least two units of secondary education, one of which must meet requirements of a “district-to-community college sharing or concurrent enrollment program,” the bill explanation stated.
The statewide articulation agreement between community colleges and the Iowa Board of Regents, which governs Iowa’s public universities, would also be required to allow the transfer of career and technical education credits alongside academic credits.
Current law requires the Iowa Department of Education to create a fund to help high school students attend career and technical education classes relating to high-demand careers over the summer if the Legislature appropriates funds to such an initiative. The bill would require this fund be created regardless of whether money is appropriated to it or not.
A fund of $600,000 does exist for summer career and technical education, Shields said, but the need has far outweighed the funding. She said the potential of putting more money toward students who want to further their education and training would hopefully better address demand.
The bill would also require school districts that create personalized academic and career plans for students in eighth grade to also discuss with them opportunities within the school district to earn relevant college credits and “industry-recognized credentials,” the bill explanation stated.
Shields said conversations around career and technical education credit transfers, as well as establishing more dedicated funding for high school students hoping to earn those credits, have been ongoing for a couple of years as concurrent enrollment has grown.
“We’re excited anytime transfer is made easier for our students, because we want them to transfer on if that’s what’s in their plans, and it is the most difficult for career and technical education students,” Shields said.

The Natrona County District Attorney maintains the Wyoming Legislature was acting in its legal authority. 
The post Weston County clerk subpoena was valid, court filings argue appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature served a valid subpoena to Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock last fall and had the authority to do so, according to the latest filings in the criminal case against the embattled clerk. 
Hadlock pleaded not guilty in November to a misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena. Lawmakers subpoenaed the clerk in September to compel her to attend a meeting in Casper as part of an investigation into her conduct surrounding an initial miscount and audit in the 2024 general election. 
Despite the subpoena, she did not attend the meeting, informing the committee ahead of time that she had a scheduling conflict. Lawmakers subsequently pursued criminal charges. In November, the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office charged Hadlock with a misdemeanor for failing to appear. 
The subpoena, however, was void because lawmakers’ investigation was illegal, Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s attorney, argued in a December motion to dismiss the case. 
More specifically, Semerad argued, the investigation into Hadlock was not the purview of the Legislature’s Management Audit Committee, and publicly conducting such an investigation violated the committee’s confidentiality statutes. 
Additionally, Hadlock was not given “fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel and meaningfully respond to the subpoena,” the filing states. 
Natrona County District Attorney Dan Itzen countered in a Thursday filing, arguing that the committee did have the authority to issue a legislative subpoena. 
“Additionally, the subpoena that the Defendant received was valid,” Itzen wrote. “Therefore, the defense’s two main arguments, that the subpoena was not properly issued and that the subpoena was defective, are ineffective.”
Itzen also pointed to the committee’s work, which included several bills that the full Legislature will consider when it convenes next month. 
“In this case, the [Management Audit Committee] subcommittee was auditing the Weston County Clerk 2024 election to determine if any future policy changes should be enacted to prevent similar misconduct from occurring in the future,” the filing states. “This purpose is exemplified by the subcommittee’s final report, which, after listing the subcommittee’s findings of fact, recommends four new policy changes.”
Hadlock knew the purpose of the subpoena and was informed of the consequences for failing to appear pursuant to her subpoena, Itzen wrote, and her absence was not excused. 
The filings also dispute that Hadlock was not given reasonable notice. 
The Legislative Service Office initially contacted Hadlock on Sept. 8, according to the filings. When she said she would not attend, Hadlock was served with a subpoena on Sept. 23. The meeting took place on Sept. 29. 
Hadlock “was put on notice that the subcommittee would likely want to hear her testimony well before the hearing,” Itzen wrote. “Thus, she had ample time to prepare to appear at the hearing and get counsel. Therefore, the defense cannot effectively argue that the defendant was unfairly surprised by this subpoena, and, therefore, the subpoena was invalid.”
Ultimately, whether Hadlock received reasonable notice, Itzen wrote, should be left to the jury, as should “any factual determinations.”
The case also presents “a separation of powers issue,” Itzen wrote, urging the court not to dismiss the case. 
By granting the motion to dismiss, “the Court would be denying the legislature any deference by overstepping into legislative action taken at a legislative hearing,” Itzen wrote. “Judicial involvement would blur the lines between the legislative and judicial branches of government.”
A hearing in the case is set for Jan. 21.
The latest filings come amid Gov. Mark Gordon’s decision to direct the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to seek Hadlock’s removal from office for “her failure to appear for a legislative subpoena and her filing of a false audit report in conjunction with her duties as the Clerk of Weston County,” according to the governor. She does not plan to resign, Semerad told WyoFile.

Mickelson Law Enforcement Center in Pierre, South Dakota, on July 8, 2024. (Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Failure to disclose past misconduct by a law enforcement officer can be enough to overturn a criminal conviction, even if that misconduct was decades old and unrelated to the crime that drew the conviction.
Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel said that’s why she asked South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley to convene a task force to standardize the collection, reporting and sharing of information about officer misconduct.
“My goal is that there would be somewhere that prosecutors and law enforcement agencies could go and share information,” said Roetzel, who was named a member of the task force when Jackley announced its creation in a press release last month. 
Details of past misbehavior are often referred to as “Giglio” or “Brady” evidence, named for the two U.S. Supreme Court cases that determined defendants have the right to know about any past dishonesty or ethical lapses by the witnesses against them.
Under those decisions, potentially damning but undisclosed evidence can upend a conviction even if a prosecutor wasn’t aware the evidence existed beforehand.
Migrant officers flock to South Dakota police departments

In an era when police officers regularly move from place to place, Roetzel said, it’s important for prosecutors to be able to keep tabs on which officers have misconduct in their personal histories. There’s no guarantee an officer’s previous employer will pass along information.
Other states also struggle with disclosure, according to a 2022 Minnesota Law Review article. 
Some agencies in some jurisdictions disclose all manner of police misconduct, wrote Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. Other agencies may only share and maintain information about dishonesty. 
Misconduct lists across the U.S., she wrote, “vary widely and are almost completely unregulated.”
The issue is a significant concern for South Dakota, Roetzel said, which has welcomed a host of officers moving in from out of state in recent years. 
“I saw several situations where an officer would move to another jurisdiction, and I felt like I needed to make a call” to the prosecutor in the officer’s jurisdiction, Roetzel said.
Attorney general: Disclosure is ‘foundation of our credibility’
Attorney General Jackley sits on the Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training Commission, which reviews applications for reciprocity by out-of-state officers and considers requests for reinstatement from officers who’ve gotten into trouble and want a second chance.
The commission also acts as a jury when an officer accused of misconduct decides to push back against the allegations to avoid sanction.
The Giglio implications of an officer’s behavior are especially important considerations for the commission, Jackley said. Criminal behavior, unethical conduct, and allegations of racism or sexism could all impact an officer’s reliability on the witness stand, Jackley said, but dishonest conduct such as lying in a police report or search warrant application can be the most damning at a trial.
Honesty and disclosure of all the facts, he said, “is the foundation of our credibility in the courtroom.”
Police academy adding extra ethics session due to heightened publicity, officer interest

Jackley and Roetzel both said the task force’s creation wasn’t prompted by an overturned conviction, but is preemptive. Every member comes from law enforcement, Jackley said, because “it’s the obligation of law enforcement to disclose.” 
Jackley’s press release on the task force said the group will review the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on disclosure and the further decisions that refined what does or doesn’t constitute evidence of misconduct. After that, the group will “make recommendations on how South Dakota law enforcement agencies can comply with the intent and spirit of the decisions. 
Misdeeds or allegations of misdeeds that may not be enough to threaten an officer’s certification may nonetheless qualify as evidence that must be disclosed to a defense lawyer, he said. 
Jackley said something like a database of misconduct is a possibility, but the first step will be for the group to find a “framework” for what needs to be disclosed and when.
Jackley is running for Congress as a Republican, and is not seeking reelection as the state’s attorney general. He said the decision to create the commission was meant in part to “finish strong” as attorney general by working to improve the justice system for years to come.
Protecting law enforcement
Deuel County Sheriff Cory Borg will serve as board president for the South Dakota Sheriff’s Association for 2026. He’ll serve as the county sheriff representative on the new Giglio task force, alongside other working officer representatives from the Highway Patrol and Vermillion Police Department.
Borg, who’s served as sheriff since 2018, has five deputies to patrol his county, which includes the cities of Clear Lake, Toronto and Brandt. He’s never had to report any misconduct from those deputies, he said, but wouldn’t hesitate to do so. 










Nobody hates a bad officer as much as a good officer.


– Deuel County Sheriff Cory Borg


The public sets a high ethical bar for officers and should, he said, since officers serve as public servants. A “bad apple” officer who grabs headlines or tanks a criminal case with dishonesty damages the public’s perception of the field.
“Nobody hates a bad officer as much as a good officer,” Borg said.
Back in Pennington County, Roetzel said she hopes the task force isn’t viewed as a group that’s out to get police. Attending to ethical issues on the front end, she said, shows people that the state respects the rule of law and those who seek to uphold it.
“This is not anti-law enforcement,” she said. “We want to protect law enforcement.”
The group will hold an organizational meeting later this month, according to Jackley’s office, after which its remaining meeting dates will be set.

Bishop William J. Barber II choked back emotion as he reflected on Wednesday’s untimely death of Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old mother who was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.
“My God, they’re killing mothers. And the grossest image that I’ve seen in a long time — you have an [airbag] covered with blood and baby dolls in the dashboard,” said Barber in recalling his reaction to seeing the videos of Good’s shooting which have been widely circulated on social media.

“The question in this moment is what kind of systems, what kind of attitudes create the atmosphere that can gin somebody up to the point that they would shoot a woman, a mother, at point blank range?” Barber asked.
The Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump maintain the ICE agent was acting in “self-defense.”
Barber did not see it that way.
“Because the spirit of hate has been unleashed. If it’s not turned around, it could destroy us all,” he warned.
Barber’s remarks came as a coalition of North Carolina religious and advocacy organizations held a Friday press conference to announce “This Is Our Selma,” a memorial march from Wilson to Raleigh in mid-February.
Barber said North Carolinians are tired of hate and tired of regressive policies that threaten Medicaid, restrict voting rights and instill fear in immigrant communities.
The coalition includes Repairers of the Breach, Indivisible, the North Carolina Council of Churches, the North Carolina Poor People’s Campaign and the Union of Southern Service Workers.
Organizers say the need for a massive march became even more apparent after legislative leaders decided last fall to redraw North Carolina’s congressional districts at the request of President Donald Trump to favor Republicans in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Critics have argued the new map undermines the voting power of the state’s rural Black voters in the 1st congressional district, which has been represented by Black lawmakers for decades.
The 1st district seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Don Davis, was North Carolina’s only competitive House seat. The Cook Political Report notes that race is no longer a toss-up. The seat leans Republican.
“That’s the only reason people do all this tricky redistricting and try to block voting rights is because they have considered that they cannot win in a fair fight,” said Barber, calling the new map blatant and racist.
Rev. Dr. Hanna Broome, director of religious affairs for Repairers of the Breach and president of the NC Council of Churches, said the march from Wilson to Raleigh is not only a commemoration of a historic moment, but a continuation.
“156 years after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, we are still pressing forward toward the promise of justice and democracy for all people,” Broome said.
Dennis Gaddy, executive director of the North Carolina Community Success Initiative, said he was moved by a sign in the chapel that read, “We won’t be diluted, we won’t be dismissed.” Gaddy said his nonprofit represents thousands of people who have at one time or another found themselves entangled with the criminal justice system and are turning their lives around.
“And there are people now who are eligible to vote that don’t know it, and they need to be empowered to go to the polls,” Gaddy said. “That’s one of the things we’ll be doing along this movement.”
In-person, early voting for the March 2026 primaries begins Feb. 12, and the group hopes the march will put a spotlight on that opportunity to be heard.
Barber encouraged the group to not speak out against the policies or an administration they oppose, but to speak out boldly in support of policies they would love to see pass including healthcare for all, fully funded public education, and living wages.
“All over the nation, people of goodwill must decide now to stand and push for democracy and a society worth having and then love forward to get it.”

Contemporary paganism is on the rise nationwide — and Vermont’s witches say it’s taken root here as well.

Maggie Byers first felt drawn to paganism during a rough patch in her life. 
Her marriage fell apart during the Covid-19 pandemic, and she began to reevaluate many aspects of herself that she’d taken for granted: her relationships, her body, her career. 
When her mother sent her a video of people reading Tarot cards, she decided to visit a Tarot reader for the first time. The experience went beyond what she could have imagined, as she felt the medium connect her with her departed relatives. 
“I’m driving home thinking, ‘I forgot about spirituality,’” she said. “All of the things that I was working on for myself, it was all grounded in the earth.”
It took another year of research and experimentation for her to identify as pagan, but it now plays an integral role in her life, whether it’s Tarot, manifesting desires through positive thinking, following the moon cycles or sitting side-by-side with her father, a Christian minister, as they both pray. 
In some ways, Americans have become less religious than ever. A decadeslong Pew study found the percentage of Americans with any religious affiliation is dropping, and Vermont in particular has the second-lowest religious affiliation of any state. 
Yet at the same time, there’s been a small but steady rise in the percentage of Americans who identify as contemporary pagans, an umbrella term that includes paganism as well as Wicca, witchcraft and a host of other belief systems. Helen Berger, a researcher at Brandeis University, calls it the “third wave” of interest in paganism after the surge in Wicca in the 1960s and renewed interest in the 1990s. 
It’s harder to say if Vermont is part of that trend, since the absolute numbers are still very small. Pew’s study, for example, reports that only 1% of Vermonters identify as pagan or Wiccan. But interviews with Vermonters who practice these beliefs suggest there is a thriving community of practitioners in the Green Mountain State.
The state’s connection to paganism surged in the 1960s and 1970s, when the back-to-the-land movement drew in migrants with more liberal and alternative beliefs. Doc Bradley, a politics and religion professor at the University of Vermont, said in October that the rise of the counterculture movement in that period prompted a shift away from mainstream religious systems in the Green Mountain State. 
Berger said contemporary pagans tend to be more common in urban environments than rural ones, but Vermont may be an exception to that rule because of its counterculture history. There are “a lot of hippies” in Vermont, she said, who could feel drawn to paganism or witchcraft for its lack of authority structure and practice of alternative healing methods.
Vermonters may also be open to contemporary paganism because of its association with feminism and environmentalism, Berger said. Many branches of it celebrate and even worship nature. 
“People go to Vermont to feel closer to nature,” Berger said. “We’re always in nature, but the concrete makes us feel more distant from it in the city, possibly.”
Today’s contemporary pagans are different from previous generations, Berger said. They’re more likely to practice alone, more likely to connect to their beliefs through online sources and more likely to find their own preferred practices rather than following set paths of study. 
“If you want to become a witch, you go online, and they say, ‘this is what you need to practice,’” Berger said. When she was studying covens in the 1990s, “people made a lot of their own tools, or they would buy them individually. Now you can buy these packages from Walmart.”
That accessibility, Berger said, has made contemporary paganism appealing to people who feel disconnected from the rigidity of other religious traditions. The most common religion remains Christianity, with 45% of Vermont adults identifying as Christians.  
“It’s considered a spirituality, rather than an institutional religion,” she said. “There’s no church, mosque, temple, synagogue to attain. It’s much more open to your own interpretation. People do magic, and they feel it works.”
Finding the light
The winter solstice, which was Dec. 21 last year, is one of the most important holidays in the pagan calendar, Berger said. It represents a celebration of the return of the light, since each day after the solstice will gradually get longer. 
Byers has created her own tradition for her family. Each year, they hang pine cones on a tree with little scraps of paper that represent their wishes for 2026. 
“It’s almost like writing to Santa Claus,” she said. 
Then in February, the deepest part of winter, they burn the pine cones to “release that energy.”
Manifesting is one of many practices that commonly fall under the realm of contemporary paganism, Berger said. Others are as diverse as the pagans and witches who practice them: tarot, spellwork, astrology, using crystals and herbs and worshipping the goddess or other divine figures are some of the most cited. 
For Cassandra, a recent Vermont convert to witchcraft, meditation with herbs and candles is the ritual that has brought her the most peace and spiritual connection in her everyday life. 
“It’s not about clearing your mind of thoughts, as some people will tell you; it is so much more about taking in your senses and regrounding in your body,” said Cassandra, who asked not to use her full name due to concerns about harassment for her beliefs. 
Jillian Kirby, a Burlington-based witch, said her favorite part of witchcraft was the altar she created for her ancestors above her cooking range. The altar has small objects that belonged to each of her deceased loved ones.

Kirby took an indirect path to her identity as a witch. Raised as a Christian churchgoer, she became a “really intense” atheist in her early adulthood. But she found herself missing the “sense of mystery” she found in church services. 
Then she found an online community of atheopagans, atheists who incorporate pagan philosophy and traditions into their lives. Kirby sometimes describes herself as a “placebo witch” and has become an ordained atheopagan cleric. 
“(There are) a lot of things that from the outside would look very specifically like the idea of spell work, but without any implication of there being a spiritual or other worldly power at work in those things,” she said. 
Kirby said online spaces have allowed many people to discover paganism or witchcraft, or their own specific niche within those beliefs, in a way that wasn’t as easy in the pre-internet era. 
“There were so many people who were sort of existing and had their own thoughts and their own practices and maybe some little thing here or there,” she said. “And then social media comes. Then people start connecting via the internet, and you find all these other people in your immediate community who are doing these weird little things that you’re into, and then they’re doing other things. And you sort of can expand your practice.” 
Byers said she was surprised to learn there were so many other Vermont witches. Although she occasionally connects with other witches on social media, she hasn’t quite gotten around to attending a local witches meetup in White River Junction. 
“It’s a busy life, and it’s hard to get out,” she said. “So I haven’t made that a priority yet.”
Berger said she’s also encountered witches who view their practice through a more symbolic lens. 
“You could still have the experiences, but not believe in it in a divine or another world way, but you’re having an experience, and those experiences are meaningful,” she said. 
Vermont may have a low rate of religious affiliation, but data from the Pew Religious Survey suggests some Vermonters without a specific religious affiliation still have spiritual views. While only 54% of Vermonters identify as part of a named religion, 81% said they believed in a soul or spirit, and 70% said they believe in something spiritual beyond the natural world. 
“They still have these experiences, feelings, needs,” Berger said. “And one way in which this need is being met is witchcraft, the metaphysical religions and being in nature.” 
Witch hunts, old and new
Modern-day contemporary paganism has few ties to the accusations of witchcraft that led to witch hunts and killings in colonial New England. Amanda Van Epps, the Vermont commissioner on women and a disability advocate, said the historical label of “witch” had more to do with who was viewed as an outsider than the person’s actual beliefs and practices. 
“The so-called ‘witch’ was really just a linguistic label signaling that someone had been singled out by their community, not so much a reflection of the practices or the beliefs of people who identify as witches today,” she said. “And I would say ironically, it wasn’t the accused who were hysterical, but rather society itself.”
Yet there have been women who describe themselves as witches as a way of reclaiming their power in a patriarchal system, she said. 
From the first wave of interest in contemporary paganism in the 1960s, the movement has been connected to feminism and the feminine divine, Berger said. 
“It is drawing in women and particularly girls because of empowerment, this sense of empowerment,” she said. 
She’s also observed a higher-than-average rate of people in the LGBTQ+ community identifying as contemporary pagans. 
“There is a hetero-centralism within Wicca,” she said. “But from the beginning, the groups that were forming were very open to alternatives, which meant alternative lifestyles and alternatives for whom you might love or create a family with. So all along there have been more gay, more trans people within paganism than in the general population.”
There’s been a long history of discrimination against contemporary pagans, stemming in part from a mistaken connection between paganism and Satanism. Van Eps said there was a certain irony to the fact that modern-day practitioners face the same accusations that victims of historic witch hunts did, even though they have no documented connection to each other. 
“Unfortunately for those who identify as a witch today, or are trying to reclaim their femininity, they may be targeted just because of the word ‘witch,’” even though their ideology is “completely different” than what they’re being accused of, Van Eps said. 
Berger said some witches in the past have lost custody of their kids because their ex-spouse argued they were an “unfit parent.” In other instances, public rituals have been disrupted or called out by Christian ministers or other religious figures as “evil.” 
The stigma continues, even in Vermont. One business owner who sells witchcraft-related products pulled out of an interview with VTDigger because, she said via email, she’s received harassing phone calls accusing her of Satanism. 
Kirby recalled taking out a book from the library as a child that happened to contain a description of palm readings. Her devout Christian grandmother made her return the book. 
“It took me a long time to not feel like I had to pretend I was just still Christian with my very intensely religious family,” she said. 
It was becoming a parent that made her realize she needed to make a more conscious decision to openly embrace her beliefs. 
“Really purposely crafting that for my kid has really grounded me in like, ‘No, this is really the choice I’m making, and it’s a completely valid choice,’” she said. 
Byers said she would study a person at first to get a sense of whether they would object to her beliefs before opening up to them about it. She also tries to find common ground with people from other religions by finding the overarching principles of love and kindness. 
“The same ideas of like, giving gratitude, forgiving yourself, being humble — it’s all the same context, just different words,” she said. 
At the same time, Vermont’s witches and pagans are able to be critical of what they see as missteps within their own movement. Cassandra said she’s cautious about avoiding “closed practices,” or rituals and beliefs that are tied to specific marginalized groups. She gave the example of sage burning or smudging, which is associated with Indigenous tribes.
“The most important thing would be to be respectful and do your homework, because a connection with witchcraft is is about your own interpretation, true, but it’s best to approach that interpretation from a respectful standpoint of people who have been practicing these spells, festivities, what have you for thousands of years,” she said. 
Byers said she tries to avoid any practice that could interfere with another person’s free will, like hexing someone. 
“That’s just bad juju,” she said. 
To her, witchcraft is more of an internal practice that has allowed her to see life in a new day. She said it has helped her quell her fear of dying and leaving people behind. 
“I have that type of faith that whatever is meant to be will happen, and that somebody will come in and take care of my kids, or people will move on and grieve as they need to,” Byers said. “So it really took away fear of dying and leaving people behind and also taking away the fear of living my life.”

This old saying comes to mind as the State of Michigan, now going back decades, has threatened to privatize or what I call the “profitization” of public community-based behavioral health, better known to many as mental health and addiction services.
These vital community resources have been provided at the local level going back to President John F. Kennedy’s administration and are desperately needed to bring a semblance of help and human decency to individuals and their families who are combating serious mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities and substance use disorders.
Using the euphemism of “bidding out or redesigning the system of care” the state under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services, going back to Governor Engler’s administration, have attempted to give the insurance companies control of billions of our tax dollars to “manage” these services.
The courts slowed down the state’s action and a recent court pronouncement resulted in a “kissing your sister ruling,” as a long-time watcher said, not fully satisfying either the department or advocates fighting the state move.
Michigan court rules state’s mental health procurement plan violates law

The ball appears to be back in Governor  Whitmer and State Department of Health and Human Services Director Hertel’s hands on how they wish to proceed.
They should follow the railway warning: Stop, look and listen.
Those advocating for the “redesign” believe it will modernize the system of care and provide better outcomes than the current system. Those advocating for the change provide no evidence or data that the changes will add any additional value or make a difference to persons in need and their families’ lives.
To the contrary these proposed changes would result in a loss of local control, increase administrative costs, replace a publicly managed care system that has a 2% overhead with a privately managed profit care system that has up to a 20% overhead.
In a strongly worded open letter to Michigan’s Governor and the State Legislature, the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI-MI) made it abundantly clear they oppose the “redesign” process saying: “The RFP/bid out process represents a significant and damaging shift in the structure and delivery of behavioral health services in our state with far-reaching harm to the ability of Michiganders to receive needed mental health care and to the locally driven system upon which 300,000 Michiganders (and the 1 million family members) have come to rely.”
The Community Mental Health Association of Michigan which is opposed to the redesign process says it provides, “serious risks without addressing the system’s core challenges.”  The organization goes on to say, “Other states that have pursued similar restructuring have experienced higher costs, workforce losses, fragmented services and diminished access for those most in need. Michigan must not repeat those mistakes.”
Debbie Stabenow, who has spent her professional career of over a half century serving as a county commissioner, state Representative, state Senator, U.S. House member and U.S. senator, has been a staunch advocate and supporter of a strong community based public mental health system. She has been a vocal critic of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services plan to privatize the state’s public mental health system.
Stabenow retired from the U.S. Senate in January 2025 but has continued to voice her opposition against the Whitmer’s administration’s effort to the state’s proposal since it was introduced in 2024.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Tenacious Debbie has ferociously argued that the state’s privatization proposal would be detrimental to patients and the public system as a whole by increasing costs, decreasing access, reduce transparency and accountability and concluded saying that Michigan’s mental health system is in need of greater public investment — not being put up for private management.
The former senator has earned the respect and admiration of  behavioral health consumers, their families and community based providers across Michigan and deserves to be listened to, and more importantly, followed.
Wishful thinking by state government is neither a strategy nor a plan. Consumers and their families fear these changes and don’t believe the state with their mantra, “We are from the government and we are here to help you.”
In her final year in office Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Legislature must pull together to enhance and improve public mental health access and integration of care in the new year. “Profitizing” it by turning it over to profit-driven insurance companies is not the answer.
Period- full stop!
This is not a side issue that impacts “those people.” Mental health and substance use disorders impact every ZIP code and one in four people across this great nation of ours. Dr. Vivek Murthy, former U.S. Surgeon General, says the mental health crisis is the biggest health concern facing the country because it impacts so many people and different facets of life.
This fact was recently bought home by the death of the iconic actor and film producer, Rob Reiner, and his wife Michelle, by their son Nick Reiner, who has been charged with their murders. Nick has struggled with mental health and addiction issues since his adolescence.
We need to listen to those most directly impacted by these threatened changes. There is a palpable fear among parents, consumers and advocates that the public mental health safety net will be ripped to shreds. Family members worry about losing long-term relationships with trusted providers and new rules that limit service. Given the struggles to get what they have, their worries are not without merit.
Critics say Michigan’s plan to open mental health contracts to bidding will outsource local care

The voices of county sheriffs, boards of county commissioners, police officer associations, local hospitals, the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan, National Alliance of Mental Illness, Michigan Mental Health Association and other advocacy organizations are opposing this false promise that would place profits before people.
The so called “redesign” is not truly about solutions to the real issues facing a system of care that does need additional support and sensible consumer-focused reforms. We must do better by serving not profiting from persons with behavioral health needs.
Here’s how we continue the pursuit of an integrated health care system that maximizes public resources, is consumer and community-focused and is data-driven and evidence-based:

Eliminate the separation of physical health care services from behavioral health care. Integrate care at the consumer level where no person is turned away. Treat the whole person; the mind is connected to the body;
Shut down services that continually abuse taxpayers’ resources while enriching themselves at the expense of those most vulnerable;
Create crisis intervention teams for law enforcement agencies throughout the state. Such partnerships between law enforcement and behavioral health care providers considerably improve care while reducing police officer injuries and costs when responding to mental health crisis calls. Sadly, our jails and prisons have become 21st-century psychiatric holding cells;
Significantly step up audits on Medicare/Medicaid providers to identify and prevent fraud and abuse;
Pay livable wages to direct-care staff. Stop the rhetoric about “supporting ‘essential’ workers” while paying invaluable staffers a pittance, often with no benefits.
Fund advocacy organizations adequately to enable them to hold the system accountable. Without their watchdog eyes and ears the system will slip off track with devastating consequences to people’s lives;
End the stigma of mental illness. Channel funds toward researching the causes of serious mental illness and developing responses to these disorders;
Utilize digital technologies and artificial intelligence which have the potential to profoundly impact behavioral health services. We need to use predictive analytics to design programs that help people engage with behavioral health services. Smart analytics could help educate people about behavioral health services;
Continue insurance reimbursement for virtual mental health services after the COVID-19 crisis subsides. It works;
Address shortages of certain specialty providers, including psychiatrists as well as eating disorder and autism specialists;
Fund local community mental health agencies to work with schools to address psychosocial issues students face that were exacerbated by the pandemic;
Create partnerships between behavioral health services and employers to boost awareness, acceptance, prevention and recovery within the workplace;
Move nonviolent persons with serious mental health issues currently in our prison system to appropriate behavioral health programs;
Hold hospitals accountable for serving people with serious mental illness. Michigan needs to get serious about using all the tools at its disposal, including certificates of need, licensing and tax policy forcing hospitals to accept public money to serve patients. Finding a psychiatric bed for someone with serious mental illness can often feel like their name is Mary or Joseph and it is Dec. 24 in Bethlehem. It is unconscionable that people with mental illness in need of hospital settings are denied service.

Decisions that benefit consumers and taxpayers instead of the “system” will lead us to a path that adds value and makes a difference. Without a shift in emphasis from profit to quality care, future policymakers will be confronted with an unfathomable mess to clean up.
Let’s work together to enhance care, support and opportunities for strangers, friends and family members with an illness or disability. A friend with cerebral palsy once called me a TAB: temporarily able-bodied. He explained that we are all one life-changing event away from needing some level of assistance. There, but for the grace of God, go I.
Everything we do should create a life of dignity and self-determination for our fellow citizens. We ought to proceed as though our actions will impact someone’s mother, father, sister, brother or son or daughter – because ultimately it will.
Let’s move forward, getting past the turf protection and place our focus on integrating care for our families and neighbors in need of quality mental health and substance use services.
People over profits.

Kelly Armstrong on Friday touted the success of the state’s application for federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding, which landed one of the largest per-capita awards in the nation.
North Dakota received $199 million for the first year of the five-year grant.
Congress set aside $50 billion for the program in its reconciliation bill last year as a way to offset losses rural states will incur due to Medicaid cuts.
The funding, awarded to North Dakota in late December, is almost double the minimum funding available to states this year.
Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma crack top five in first rural hospital funding allocation

The funding amounts to roughly $561 per North Dakota resident, according to an analysis by policy research organization KFF. Only six states received larger per-capita awards. The average grant amount was about $200 million per state.
States are guaranteed at least $500 million over the five-year period, but could receive more depending on the strength of their applications and other factors. 
Hoeven, a Republican, said his goal is for North Dakota to receive the maximum possible award of $1 billion.
He pointed to North Dakota’s existing hospital and communications infrastructure as factors that set its application apart.
The state has a very short window to get the money out into the hands of communities. North Dakota has until the end of September 2026 to obligate the funding, and until September 2027 to spend it.
The state Department of Health and Human Services is hiring a liaison to help tribal communities apply for the federal funding. Tribes’ unique legal status means their applications for grant money may have different requirements, Armstrong said. 
“We want to make sure that they have access to somebody on our staff that helps them do that and gives them the best chance of success,” the Republican said.
State lawmakers will convene for a special legislative session later this month to authorize the spending of the grant money.
North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

A committee of lawmakers tasked with guiding the state’s application for Rural Health Transformation Program funding will meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the $200 million award and to discuss bill drafts for the special session.
While Armstrong called the special session to allocate the federal funding, lawmakers could also consider legislation related to other issues.
Legislative Management will meet on Wednesday to discuss the scope of the session.
Legislators will consider four policy bills that the state pledged to adopt in its Rural Health Transformation Program application. They would require schools to participate in a federal fitness test, require ongoing nutrition education for doctors, have North Dakota join a physician assistant licensure compact and to expand the services pharmacists are authorized to provide.
The federal government indicated that states with these policies would get larger grant awards.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Democratic leaders in the Washington state Legislature said Friday they have no plans to hold hearings on two conservative-backed initiatives focused on parental rights of students in public schools and banning transgender athletes from playing girls’ sports.
Both Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, staked out this position in remarks to reporters. It creates a high likelihood that both of the initiatives will go before Washington voters on midterm ballots this November.
“I’m certain that we will not be passing either of those initiatives,” Pedersen said. “They’ll be up to the voters to decide.”
The political committee Let’s Go Washington said it turned in more than 400,000 signatures for each of the two initiatives last week. Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager who leads the group, urged lawmakers to reconsider holding hearings. 
“Not only would this be a blatant slap in the face to the hundreds of thousands of Democrat, Independent, and Republican voters who support the measures, it would be a clear sign that they don’t care about the abuses to children, families, and female athletes taking place in the state,” Heywood said in a statement.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said he hasn’t read the initiatives but “it’d be the first time I ever supported a Bill Heywood initiative,” making an apparent flub of Heywood’s first name.
“If what you’re hearing is the Legislature saying it should go to the voters for a vote, I tend in general, as a general matter, I don’t have a problem,” he told reporters Friday.
The vows from legislative Democrats don’t come as a surprise. 
The parental rights measure would immediately undo a new state law Democrats fought to pass last year. That law rewrote a Let’s Go Washington initiative known as the parental “bill of rights” that lawmakers passed in 2024.
IL26-001 would repeal the changes made to the 2024 initiative by House Bill 1296, one of the most controversial bills passed in the 2025 legislative session. Democrats said the rewrite was necessary to clarify the earlier Heywood-backed initiative, which sought to codify rights for parents of public school students under age 18. 
The goal of the 2024 initiative was to ensure parents have easy access to school materials, their child’s medical records and immediate notification if a child is involved in a crime. One of the major changes in last year’s legislation removed parental access to medical records.
IL26-638 looks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports.
Even though Ferguson said he wasn’t an expert on the initiatives, he said, “We live in a world right now where trans kids are going through a lot.”
“I want to support trans kids,” he said. 
Ferguson also had a brief but tense exchange with conservative commentator Brandi Kruse, who asked about his position on the initiative, given his daughter competes in school sports. The governor responded by suggesting Kruse has an “obsession with trans kids.”
Both measures appear to have enough signatures to move forward to the Legislature, then to voters in November. But the secretary of state’s office still needs to certify the initiatives before they can be considered. That’ll likely take several weeks. 
Lawmakers technically have three options with the citizen initiatives. They can approve them and make them law, though that won’t happen in this case. They can send them to the ballot for voters to decide, the presumed outcome here. Or they could pass an alternative to an initiative, leaving it up for voters to weigh in on both.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s administration contracted last month with The GEO Group to operate a dormant prison in Hudson as an immigrant detention center for at least six months, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado.
The documents, released by the ACLU on Thursday after a Freedom of Information Act request, are the clearest indication yet that federal immigration authorities have prioritized reopening the facility in Hudson, located about 30 miles northeast of Denver, as they ramp up detention capacity in Colorado in pursuit of Trump’s mass deportation plans.
The dormant Big Horn Correctional Facility, formerly known as the Hudson Correctional Facility, is a 1,200-bed prison that operated for a span of just five years after its 2009 opening. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract for “comprehensive detention services” at the facility was issued to The GEO Group on Dec. 1, 2025, but the amount and terms of the contract are redacted in the documents.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about the released documents or when the Hudson facility might reopen. The documents also contain a previous $39 million contract for The GEO Group to operate the facility for the six-month period beginning in April of last year, but the prison remained empty.
ACLU advocates criticized the government’s heavy redactions of the released documents, with Tim Macdonald, the ACLU of Colorado’s legal director, demanding “more transparency into how (ICE officials) plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to imprison more people who have not been convicted of any crime.”
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Colorado is currently home to only one ICE detention center, an Aurora facility also operated by The GEO Group. The Hudson facility is one of six potential new sites for ICE detention under consideration in Colorado, a list that also includes the dormant Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg and the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio. The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds, tripling its detention capacity in the state.
The latest records obtained by the ACLU also contain a document known as a “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition,” or JOFOC, which is required when the federal government awards a contract without a competitive bidding process — but the 98-page file is completely redacted.
In August, following the passage of $45 billion in funding for expanded immigration detention in Republicans’ spending and tax cut law, GEO Group chairman George Zoley spoke during an earnings call about the “attractive opportunity for investors” presented by “the unprecedented growth opportunities we anticipate will materialize over the balance of this year and next year.”
“The documents we received from ICE fail to answer fundamental questions about the agency’s planned expansion for the Denver field office,” Scott Medlock, a senior staff attorney with the Colorado ACLU, said in a statement. “With Congress allocating unprecedented resources and funding to ICE and DHS, the public deserves to know how the federal government intends to use this infusion of money.”

(Julia Goldberg/SourceNM)With the start of 2026, expect to see a ramp-up toward New Mexico’s June 2 primary and, of course, the Nov. 3 midterms. Source NM will be both rounding up and digging into the election cycle. For now, here’s an overview of campaign activity in the first week of the year.
Signature scamper
More than a dozen candidates have announced campaigns for New Mexico’s top executive office in the 2026 election, as current Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, is term-limited from running again. 
In order to appear on the ballot, candidates running with either of the state’s major Democratic or Republican parties must collect a little more than 2,000 signatures from members of their political parties and submit them to the Secretary of State by a Feb. 3 deadline, according to state law. 
The secretary of state’s office will publish the petition forms for minor party and independent candidates, including the required number of signatures, by March 31. Those candidates have until June 25 to file for candidacy, since they do not participate in the primary elections. 
The law requires that signatures for the major party candidates represent 2% of registered voters in the party who voted in the last gubernatorial primary election. For Democrats that number is 2,505 and for Republican candidates that’s 2,351 signatures, according to the state’s election information guide. 
Candidates have until the deadline to collect signatures, and then submit that along with other paperwork to the Secretary of State, according to Alex Curtas, a spokesperson for the office.
“At this point no one is officially a candidate for anything,” Curtas told Source NM in an email. “People have made announcements and ‘declared’ they are running, but no one is officially running until the paperwork is submitted and verified/accepted by our office on candidate filing day.”
Four candidates have reported exceeding the signature counts in statements from their campaigns. They include Democratic candidates Deb Haaland, the former Secretary of the Interior and U.S. congresswoman, who reported exceeding the minimum within 24 hours in October; and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, who has gathered more than 8,000 signatures, his campaign spokesperson told Source NM on Friday.
Republican candidates Gregg Hull, the mayor of Rio Rancho; and recent entry to the race Duke Rodriguez, a cannabis businessman and former cabinet secretary under former Gov. Gary Johnson, also said they’ve met the threshold. 
Rodriguez said in a news release this week he had collected more than 6,000 signatures.
“This wasn’t about checking a box. It was about earning trust,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “Every signature represents a real person who took time to participate, engage, and make their voice heard. That matters.”
 
New entries


While no campaign will be official until the Feb. 3 filing day, candidates are still announcing their entries into the race.
James “Jim” Ellis, a former Public Regulation Commissioner appointed by Lujan Grisham in 2023, who served until 2024, unveiled his website earlier this week, saying his platform is building “affordability, opportunity, and trust in government.” An emailed request for comment was not returned by deadline.
Ellis is the fourth candidate to seek the Republican nomination, with a field that includes Hull, Rodriguez and Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec). Lanier has served in the state senate since his election in 2024, and served one term as a San Juan County commissioner. 
Dem contenders report additional events, endorsements
Haaland opened the new year with a donation of more than 350 books Friday to the Albuquerque-based literacy nonprofit Read to Me!
“By investing in education we invest in New Mexico’s future. As governor, I’ll prioritize making sure kids can read early on day one,” she said in a social media post.
Also this week, Bregman received the endorsement of Ohkay Owingeh, his third tribal endorsement.
Ohkay Owingeh Governor Benny J. Lujan said in a Jan. 5 statement that Bregman “respects our sovereignty and understands the realities facing our community,”  in the official endorsement. 
“He listens, he follows through, and he approaches tribal nations as partners not afterthoughts. That distinction matters,” Lujan said.
Bregman celebrated the endorsement in a statement. 
“I’m deeply honored by the trust Ohkay Owingeh has placed in me,” Bregman said. “For decades, I’ve stood alongside tribal governments in the fight for sovereignty and fairness. As governor, I will make sure tribal nations have a real partner in the Governor’s Office and a real voice in state government.”
Bregman also took to social media at the end of 2025 with what he called an “Obama-inspired favorites list” that included items such as his favorite musician and beer (Luke Combs and Coors).
What’s in a name
The Santa Fe County Clerk’s Office on Friday issued a news release reminding candidates of an approaching deadline for their own voter registrations. Once the Secretary of State issues the official election proclamation on Jan. 26, under state law anyone interested in running for office will be unable to make any changes to their names, addresses or political party affiliations. Those rules do not apply to anyone not running for office.

(Screenshot/YouTube, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman is no longer demanding a resignation from the chair of the state’s wildlife management board while the AG’s office analyzes a provision in state law that’s key to the dispute.
An earlier interpretation by the AG’s office has raised hackles among hunters and anglers across the state who say it runs afoul of how a license exemption for hunting or fishing on one’s own farmland has long been understood and enforced.
Sen. Gary Boswell (LRC Public Information)
The AG’s office is pausing its demand that Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission Chair Chuck Meade immediately resign after receiving a request from state Sen. Gary Boswell for an attorney general’s opinion, said Aaron Silletto, the AG’s executive director of the Office of Civil and Environmental Law, in a Jan. 8 letter to Meade’s attorney. 
Boswell, R-Owensboro, is asking if an exemption in state law that allows the “resident owner of farmlands” to hunt and fish on that land without having to buy a Kentucky hunting or fishing license only applies if someone lives on that farmland. 
“In light of this request, the office withdraws its request that your client resign immediately from his position on the Fish and Wildlife Resources Commission; we will revisit this matter after the publication of the Opinion of the Attorney General requested by Sen. Boswell,” Silletto wrote to Meade’s attorney. “We will be in touch with you regarding the opinion once it is published.” 
The Lantern previously reported Silletto in a December letter demanded Meade resign from the commission because he did not have the required five years worth of hunting and fishing licenses to be eligible to serve on the commission. Silletto wrote the resignation demand resulted from an investigation spurred by a citizen’s complaint the office received in October. Silletto did not name who filed the complaint.
Meade responded, citing the exemption for farmland owners and saying that he had met the legal requirements to serve on the commission by hunting on his family’s Lawrence County farm every year since 2008. Silletto responded that because he did not live on the farm, Meade did not qualify for the license exemption. 
Hunters and anglers say the exemption has historically meant one had to be a resident of Kentucky and own the farmland with no requirement to reside on the land.
Bill Repasky, an attorney for Meade, echoed that argument in a Dec. 31 letter addressed to Silletto responding to the resignation demand. Repasky wrote Silletto’s interpretation of the exemption was in “stark opposition to working knowledge held by our many public officials charged with enforcing Kentucky’s game and fish laws.” 
In a Friday statement to the Lantern, Repasky said the attorney general’s decision to “revisit his earlier position” was welcomed. 
“We are confident this controversy will be favorably resolved in the near future. In the interim, Chuck Meade looks forward to continuing his work as the representative of District 7 and to advocating for all the sportsmen and women of our commonwealth as chairman of the Kentucky Fish and Game Commission,” Repasky said. 
Commission members oversee the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees and federal grants. The commission also implements and changes hunting and fishing regulations. 
State law also directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the department’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
The concern among sportspeople
Jim Strader, the host of a Kentucky radio show about hunting and fishing, during an episode earlier this month said he’s been “flooded with calls” about the news of Silletto’s resignation demand and what the interpretation of the exemption in the letter could mean for hunters and anglers.
Jim Strader posing with a fish. (Provided)
Strader in a Lantern interview gave a hypothetical example of someone who builds a farm pond on their private property and pays to stock it with fish. The Kentucky Department of Fish and WIldlife Resources no longer stocks private recreational ponds. 
“Why should they have to buy a license?” Strader said, adding that he generally encourages people to purchase licenses to support wildlife management. 
The League of Kentucky Sportsmen, representing thousands of hunters across the state, in a late December press release called on the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources to clarify the interpretation of the license exemption because “tens of thousands of Kentucky sportsmen could be affected” by it. 
David Casey, the former assistant director of law enforcement at the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, worked 24 years at the department and retired in 2009. 
He told the Lantern he recalls no instances of hunters or anglers being cited by game wardens for hunting and fishing on their own farmland without a license. 
“It’s always been in my time with the department, if you own the land and live in the state of Kentucky, you can hunt and fish on that property without a license,” Casey said. 
Casey said the farmland exemption did come into question if someone who lived outside of Kentucky was hunting or fishing on Kentucky farmland the person owned without a license. That out-of-state hunter or angler would thereby be violating state law because the person did not have a specific non-resident license. 
Casey believed Silletto’s interpretation of the exemption “would affect so many people.”  
“Everybody that lives in Louisville, Lexington, all the metropolitan areas, all your doctors and lawyers and professional people that own land that they have to hunt on probably don’t live on it,” Casey said. 
Casey said the way he understood the exemption, the department did not want to charge hunters and anglers a licensing fee for using private land they may also be managing for wildlife, timber and other resources.

Lisa Jackson, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, said in a Jan. 6 statement the department’s chief executive, Commissioner Rich Storm, “supports allowing bona fide resident owners of farmlands to hunt and fish on their own farmlands.” 
“Enforcement of the landowner exemption has likely varied over the decades. Establishing a definition of ‘resident owners of farmlands’ through legislative action could provide beneficial clarity,” Jackson said in her statement. “To those landowners who are not required by law to purchase a license or permit but choose to do so to support conservation efforts in Kentucky, Commissioner Storm extends his sincere thanks.” 
Jackson emphasized in her statement that wildlife is a “public trust for all citizens and is managed for the public benefit” and that the department is primarily funded through license and permit sales, alongside other fees and grants. 
Boswell in a Lantern interview on Friday said his request for a formal opinion from the attorney general has less to do with Meade’s standing on the commission and more to do with “whether thousands of hunters are violating the law.” 
Boswell said he would prefer hunters and anglers to voluntarily buy a license regardless.
“I don’t think the legislature wants to get involved in this issue. I don’t want to get involved in it. We might have to,” Boswell said. 
Boswell said he was hopeful the attorney general would “come to the same conclusion that I have had for the last 50 years of my life — that you do not have to have a hunting license to hunt on your own property.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-22-at-12.34.11-PM-1024x657.png,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota prosecutors are asking the public for evidence in the killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent on Wednesday after the Trump administration froze local law enforcement out of the investigation.
“Every moment in these cases is precious,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison at a news conference in Minneapolis on Friday. “If you have information bearing on the outcome of this matter in any way, please share it.”
The Attorney General’s Office and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office set up a portal for people to submit photos, videos and other evidence they think may help prosecutors understand the case and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will catalogue the submissions.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings and was on the scene at Portland Avenue near 34th Street collecting evidence after an ICE officer, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her Honda Pilot.
But on Thursday, the agency announced the U.S. Attorney’s Office had made the unusual decision that the FBI would be the sole investigative agency, effectively freezing out local law enforcement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” BCA superintendent Drew Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz and other state Democrats have expressed doubt that the public could trust the results of an investigation conducted solely by the federal government.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a Thursday news conference that local officials “have not been cut out. They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”
The standoff over jurisdiction adds to a contentious fight between state leaders and the Trump administration over fraud in state social service programs and a surge of thousands of federal agents and officers in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty emphasized that local officials have the authority to both investigate the shooting and potentially bring criminal charges based on the evidence.
“We do have jurisdiction,” Moriarty said. “We cannot make any decision, however, if there is not evidence submitted to our office.”
Moriarty said the FBI has possession of key evidence, including Good’s car and the shell casings from the officer’s gun. She also acknowledged they have really no access to federal law enforcement officers for interviews.
She said she does not have concerns about the integrity of the FBI, but rather that they won’t turn over their findings for state prosecutors to review.
“In the past, the FBI has invited us to see a high level overview of their investigation, but we were prohibited from seeing the entire investigation or talking about what we saw,” Moriarty said.
Prosecutions of federal law enforcement officers are also complicated by the fact that they have immunity from state prosecution for carrying out their duties.
But legal experts emphasize that immunity does not extend to officers who use unreasonable and excessive force.

The Department of Public Utilities, in its annual report to lawmakers on the state’s natural gas pipe system, found that the gas companies collectively spent $814.4 million to replace about 266 miles of leak-prone pipes. That’s by far the most the utilities ever spent since GSEP was created in 2014 and a nearly 40 percent increase in what was spent the year prior — despite the fact that the utilities replaced slightly fewer miles of leak-prone pipe than in 2023. 
“The [utilities] have spent more money per mile, with the progress at remediating leak-prone pipe occurring at a pace that is largely unchanged from when the GSEP program was first initiated,” DPU said in its report. 
The latest data on utilities’ work to replace leaky pipes, which emit the potent greenhouse gas of methane into the atmosphere, paints an even more damning picture of GSEP as costs balloon with few additional results — driving up ratepayer bills — and places recent reform efforts into greater context. 
“We’ve just seen an absolute explosion in the costs of this program, and it appears to be far beyond inflation,” said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at Acadia Center, an environmental research and advocacy nonprofit. 
Massachusetts established GSEP in 2014 with the best of intentions: to create an incentive for utilities to quickly fix leaks across the state’s aging 21,000 miles of natural gas pipes and to provide Bay Staters who heat their homes and cook with gas a safer system and one that minimizes emissions.  
Since then, though, the program has been beset by runaway costs and contention over how the state squares the circle of justifying hundreds of millions of dollars each year in investments into a gas system that Massachusetts is at the same time trying to cut off — and rather quickly.  
The utilities have spent $6.2 billion on new gas pipes through GSEP, and spending through the program has increased by an average of 12 percent each year since 2015, according to the attorney general’s office, amid soaring material and labor costs. GSEP costs account for 8 to 11 percent of ratepayers’ monthly bills, the AG says. 
The DPU stepped in last year to make key changes to address the climbing costs, including cutting how much utilities can recover from ratepayers through GSEP and incentivizing repairing lines instead of replacing them.  
That DPU order came after negotiations over GSEP reforms proved to be a sticking point in the State House as lawmakers hammered out the 2024 climate bill. 
State officials project the DPU order will reduce bills as Beacon Hill seeks to lower the cost of energy in Massachusetts, home to the country’s third-highest residential electricity prices. Regulators launched an investigation late last year at the urging of Gov. Maura Healey to review all charges on gas and electric bills. 
Public outrage last winter over high ratepayer bills fueled Healey’s energy affordability bill currently under consideration in the Legislature. That has prompted fierce debate over what’s driven the rising costs, with some lawmakers even pushing to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments to halve greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels. 
The GSEP issues have exposed the tough choices facing Beacon Hill as it manages an energy transition: continue to spend money on an expensive gas system, spreading out the costs over fewer people as households switch to electric, or begin to retire the network of pipes altogether in favor of technologies like geothermal and electric heat pumps — the latter of which entails up-front costs but promises savings down the line. 
“If you do business as usual here, you’re going to keep throwing money at a system that is becoming antiquated,” Murray said. “And we’re going to stick an ever-declining ratebase with these costs, and then you are going to end up in an even greater affordability crisis. We’re going to be stuck with stranded assets if we don’t change the way we fundamentally do business here.” 
Total gas leaks in the state have been cut in half since 2014, according to DPU’s report, with just over 9,000 pending leaks at the end of 2024, a nearly 15 percent decrease from the year prior.  
But even then, the worst of the leaks, which require the most immediate action and represent an “existing or probable hazard,” increased from 37 to 40 from 2023 to 2024, as utilities battle the “Whack-a-Mole” of new leaks that emerge.  
National Grid, the utility that operates the most miles of natural gas pipes in the state, was responsible for all 40 of these leaks not yet fixed at the end of 2024.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CorrodedNaturalGasPipelineInspection-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

A ‘physical disturbance’ involving three incarcerated people occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Oshkosh Correctional Institution, Oshkosh police said in a statement. The department said it is investigating a death that occurred after the disturbance. 
Beth Hardtke, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, told the Examiner that Teng Vang, 43, died Thursday at a hospital. He was assigned to Oshkosh Correctional Institution. 
Police said a 43 year-old incarcerated person who assaulted another incarcerated person was secured by prison staff. He experienced a medical emergency and was transported to a local hospital. 
Hardtke wrote that the Oshkosh Police Department is investigating the death and the Department of Corrections is fully cooperating with the investigation.
Vang was found guilty of crimes including attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree recklessly endangering safety. He was released on extended supervision in 2022, which was revoked in 2024.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama appeals court ruled Friday that the state can license and regulate freestanding birth centers as hospitals.
In a unanimous opinion overturning a lower court ruling, Alabama Court of Civil Appeals Judge Terry Moore wrote that birthing centers were hospitals under state law and subject to regulation by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
Moore wrote that the centers were delivering “obstetrical care . . . to the public generally” under a 1949 state law defining and governing hospitals.

“We do not believe that the legislature intended that only institutions utilizing obstetrics to treat pregnant women should be treated as ‘hospitals’ and be regulated by the ADPH while institutions providing alternative midwifery care, which implicates identical health and safety concerns, should not be considered ‘hospitals’ and should not be regulated by the ADPH,” Moore wrote. 
Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham and Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville filed suit against ADPH in 2023, a few months after the agency adopted new regulations requiring centers to be under the oversight of a physician or medical director and to be within 30 minutes of a hospital with OB-GYN services. 
The centers, which provide an in-between option for individuals who do not feel comfortable with a home birth but prefer an out-of-hospital birth, said the regulations would make it difficult or impossible for them to provide services around the state, particularly in rural areas that lack hospitals.  
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement Friday that the decision could lead to birth centers not being able to provide midwifery care in the state.
“Birth centers are needed here. Midwives and doulas are needed here. We are committed to continuing this fight on behalf of our clients and all Alabamians,” JaTaune Bosby-Gilchrist, ACLU of Alabama’s executive director, said in a statement.
The ACLU said it will seek “further court review” and that the birthing centers will continue to operate while that continues.
A message seeking comment from ADPH was left Friday afternoon.
Alabama has long struggled with higher-than-average infant mortality rates. According to ADPH, the state’s infant mortality rate was 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births in 2024. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, but still significantly higher than the national infant mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births 
Infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high and racial disparities wide. According to the ADPH data, the infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
Birth centers help bridge the gap for mothers in rural Alabama. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
“We will continue to fight for pregnant Alabamians to be able to access high-quality midwifery care in birth centers without burdensome and unnecessary interference from the state,” Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. “The essential care birth centers provide to Alabama families has never been more necessary than it is right now, with Alabama facing a serious maternal and infant health crisis that is disproportionately affecting Black Alabamians, those with low incomes, and rural communities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PXL_20230808_144437258-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)A buildup of hazardous gas at Alaska’s Red Dog mine in recent weeks forced the huge zinc and lead operation to fit workers with respirators and ramp up air monitoring at the mine and in nearby villages.
Since November, reactive ore and waste rock at the remote Northwest Alaska mine has been generating higher-than-usual amounts of sulfur dioxide — a colorless gas that, in high enough concentrations, can cause health problems.
The rock unearthed at Red Dog, one of the world’s largest zinc mines and a major employer in the region, has long generated low levels of sulfur dioxide. The gas, known as SO2, occurs naturally through a chemical reaction when minerals in Red Dog’s ore and waste rock come into contact with air.
But the emissions lately have increased because the mine has been digging up especially reactive rocks — and cold, calm weather has allowed the gas to settle over parts of the sprawling operation.
In recent weeks, sulfur dioxide drifted into mine buildings and reached levels high enough to fuel health concerns among mine employees and officials at the Indigenous-owned corporation that owns the land beneath the operation. Shareholders of the corporation, NANA, make up a significant portion of Red Dog’s workforce.
The mine’s operator, Vancouver-based Teck Resources, temporarily evacuated workers from certain areas, limited mineral production and has taken steps to drive emissions back down, according to correspondence obtained by Northern Journal. In the meantime, the company says it’s working to limit the number of workers on site.
“Many of you are concerned and frustrated and have questions regarding our…response to SO2 levels within the buildings,” a Teck supervisor said in a recent email to workers. “The leadership team takes the health and safety of our workforce seriously, including the SO2 challenges being faced.”
Teck has said that sulfur dioxide concentrations at the mine did not exceed federal health and safety standards and that, out of an abundance of caution, it has taken steps to mitigate risks and protect workers.
“Efforts to cool reactive areas and increased wind have resulted in a decline in SO2 levels in recent days,” Teck spokesperson Dale Steeves said in an email this week.
The company, he added, is working closely with federal regulators and NANA to monitor and reduce gas emissions and “ensure continued health and safety of our workforce.”
Teck does not anticipate a material impact on overall production at the mine, Steeves said.
“Red Dog is continuing to operate with appropriate health and safety measures in place,” he said.
The problems at Red Dog have played out under the radar for weeks, even as federal mine safety regulators investigated complaints.
The issue then emerged into public view earlier this month in an unusually blunt statement on social media from NANA, which has long worked closely with Teck. The Native corporation is owned by some 15,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to Northwest Alaska and receives a share of the mine’s profits.
“NANA is communicating our concerns, and the concerns of shareholders, to the operator and has been taking action within our role as the landowner to ensure those concerns are clearly conveyed and addressed,” the company said.

The statement came a day after Red Dog’s general manager — Teck employee Les Yesnik — sent NANA’s chief executive a memo laying out the situation. NANA then distributed the memo to its shareholders.
Red Dog’s main pit contains rock that’s reactive with oxygen and can “self-heat under certain environmental conditions,” Yesnik said in the memo, which was obtained by Northern Journal.
The chemical reaction between the rock and air naturally emits sulfur dioxide, which in low concentrations can cause irritation to the nose, eyes, throat and lungs and in high concentrations can cause permanent lung damage, Yesnik’s memo said.
Red Dog’s operations have generated the gas since the 1990s, but high iron levels in the ore that’s currently being processed and in the mine’s waste rock have recently created “hot spots” in the pit, Yesnik said.
Low temperatures and low winds have “allowed emissions to settle in lower-lying areas,” where some buildings are located — including where employees sleep and eat, according to the memo.
In response, Teck said, the company has adopted numerous measures to protect workers and reduce the emissions.
It has set up dozens of indoor and outdoor monitoring stations, installed new air filters and has used a water truck to cool the hot spots.
The company also has drafted plans to move reactive rock into a pit filled with water or to bury it beneath less reactive waste.
Teck has reduced production, too, though it needs to maintain some output to avoid damage from an equipment freeze-up in temperatures below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, Yesnik said in the memo.
NANA declined to comment.
Sulfur dioxide emissions are a rarely discussed mining problem, but the issue at Red Dog is not unprecedented, said Dave Chambers, president of the Center for Science in Public Participation, a Montana-based nonprofit that analyzes the environmental impacts of mines.
Chambers said he’s heard of similar problems at other mines with deposits rich in sulfide minerals, though he wasn’t aware of an instance when the gas emissions were high enough to cause an air quality problem. Sulfur dioxide emissions are likely much higher from other sources at mines, like diesel generators, than they are from ore or waste rock, Chambers added.
Teck has been sharing SO2 data with regulators at the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, the company told employees.
That regulatory agency, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, investigated the complaints and concluded “negative findings” for each one, said labor department spokesperson Kristen Knebel.
Knebel did not immediately answer additional questions about MSHA’s actions and would not provide copies of the complaints. Northern Journal submitted a request for those records under the Freedom of Information Act; MSHA estimated the request would take one month to process.
State environmental regulators said they are monitoring the situation but only learned of it through an inquiry from Northern Journal.
Alaska’s regulations require companies to notify the Department of Environmental Conservation about releases of hazardous substances.
The department is coordinating with Teck to clarify reporting requirements “since it’s not a routine hazardous substance release, and we don’t encounter this type of situation very often,” Kimberley Maher, a regulator with the agency’s spill response program, said in an email to Northern Journal.

TPS provides a shield against deportation for people from counties in the middle of a humanitarian crises or armed conflict. Since regaining office a year ago, Trump has terminated or announced intent to terminate TPS for more than 1 million individuals, according to the American Immigration Council.
The Democrats addressed their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Department  of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
In the case of Venezuela, Noem announced in January 2025 that the administration was ending the 18-month extension of TPS for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans that former President Joe Biden had implemented just 10 days days before he left the White House. The Biden White House had said that the extension was warranted “based on the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the inhumane Maduro regime.”
The letter sent on Friday to Rubio and Noem was signed by 70 congressional Democrats.
“Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS … are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger — conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro,” the letter says. “Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.”
“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the letter adds. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now. This termination of lawful status has caused unimaginable fear and anxiety for law-abiding Venezuelan families, who passed criminal background checks, earned work permits, and paid fees and taxes.”
The Democrats go on to say in the letter that the Trump administration has “abandoned the Venezuelans that remain in Venezuela who yearn for freedom and a democratic transition,” noting how Maduro’s “criminal accomplices remain in power,” specifically mentioning interim president Delcy Rodriguez, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello (who was indicted on narco-terrorism charges alongside Maduro by the U.S. Justice Department in 2020).
“We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado,” the Democrats write.

The Montana Cannabis and Alcohol Regulation Division (CARD) is offering its third annual opportunity for graduating high school seniors to apply for Alcohol Responsibility Matters scholarships.
Seniors who will attend a Montana college, apprentice program, or certificate institute are encouraged to apply for the scholarship, which includes coming up with a design and writing a brief paragraph dedicated to answering the question: “What does ‘Alcohol Responsibility Matters’ mean to you and your community?”
CARD will award five seniors a one-time, $2,000 scholarship.
The scholarship funds come from the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, which distributes alcohol education awards to state member organizations, including CARD, a division of the Department of Revenue.
Selected winners will have their original artwork designs used to promote responsible alcohol consumption across Montana. According to CARD, the artwork will have a consistent theme centered on Montana and the tagline “Alcohol Responsibility Matters,” and the existing logo, along with the student’s original artwork idea.
CARD hopes to provide community-centered messages reminding individuals 21 and over of the importance of being responsible when consuming alcohol and to support year-round alcohol awareness.
The scholarship is targeted toward high school seniors, knowing that while most are under the age of 21, moving forward in life to college, or post-secondary institutions without parent or guardians guidance, there may be increased pressure to drink.
According to the scholarship page, the requirements of the submissions include the artwork design and a 250-word paragraph explaining the design, which could be used for posters, t-shirts, stickers, decals and other marketing materials.
Students may draw something, create something in PowerPoint, Illustrator, Canva, InDesign, etc., and then (if chosen) CARD will take the design/idea and work to create artwork. Generative AI, such as ChatGPT or other similar applications for essays or artwork, will not be accepted.
The application deadline is January 25, and details about the application process can be found online at the scholarship website.
In 2025, the Department of Revenue announced it had selected five scholarship winners out of 55 submissions. The winning students were from Shepard, Libby, Bozeman, Cut Bank and Thompson Falls.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-1.png,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens’ roster will welcome back a strong collection of talent from their first FBS season.
 
The NCAA football transfer portal opened on January 2, allowing players from programs across the country to look for a new home in the new year. According to ESPN, over 4,000 players entered their name into the transfer portal and only a week has gone by since the official window opened. Players will have until January 16, to enter their name into the transfer portal and even longer after that to officially choose a new place to play. 
The Blue Hens are no stranger to the advantages presented by the transfer portal. Last season, Delaware signed 12 transfers to their roster. The transfer class included the Blue Hens’ leader in receiving touchdowns — Kyre Duplessis — and defensive end Noah Matthews who finished with seven tackles for loss and two sacks. 
This offseason the Blue Hens have yet to sign any transfers, but they’re welcoming back many of their players from last year’s bowl game squad. In total, 19 players from last year’s roster announced their intent to remain with the program next season. Only two players announced their intention to depart.  
One of the first players to announce their intent to return was quarterback Nick Minicucci. The junior quarterback completed his season with multiple second place finishes in the Delaware record books trailing program legend, Joe Flacco, in completions for a season and total yards in a season. Minicucci threw for 3,683 yards and 23 touchdowns leading Conference USA’s top passing attack. His 283.31 passing yards per game landed him top ten in the nation.
In addition to Minicucci, wide receiver Sean Wilson announced via X he is returning to UD next season. Wilson finished as the Blue Hens top receiver with 68 catches and 877 receiving yards. Tight end Elijah Sessoms and running backs Jo Silver and Viron Ellison Jr. are returning to the program as well, bringing back over 1,500 yards of total offense combined from last season.
Three members of UD’s starting offensive line have announced they will be returning to the program. Anthony Caccese, Noah Rosahac and second-team all CUSA lineman Steven Demboski all announced their intent to return next season. The only member of the offensive line to announce they will not return to Newark, is starting left tackle Anwar O’Neal. 
O’Neal entered the portal before the holidays and announced via X on January 7, that he will be playing at Louisville next season. The only other Delaware player to enter the portal thus far is wide receiver Thomas Amankwaa, according to On3 and confirmed via an announcement on his X account. 
UD’s defense is benefiting from players deciding to stay just as much as the offense. 
Matthews announced he will be returning to the team next season along with fellow defensive end Brandon Gorham.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)A Maine superior court judge blocked the expansion of Maine’s largest landfill on Friday, siding with the Penobscot Nation and Boston-based environmental group Conservation Law Foundation.
Penobscot County Superior Court Judge Bruce Mallonee ruled against the Department of Environmental Protection, saying the department had not done adequate fact finding to determine that expanding Juniper Ridge Landfill, located near Old Town, would benefit the public, and did not consider the environmental impacts that the landfill has on the nearby Penobscot Nation.
“For generations, we have spoken about the many impacts our community fights against at once — on our health, our lands, and the Penobscot River, the oldest citizen of our Nation,” said Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis in a statement responding to the court’s decision. “This ruling affirms that those burdens must be taken seriously. We hope it signals a shift toward decisions that listen more closely to Indigenous voices and consider the full picture of the harm our communities face.”
Maine opens door for landfill expansion despite community objections

Juniper Ridge has long been a focus of the Tribe and neighboring community, members of which expressed concerns about air and water pollution. 
More than half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up at Juniper Ridge. It is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of waste management company Casella.
Expecting that it will reach capacity in 2028, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection determined in October 2024 that expanding the landfill would benefit the public, allowing Casella to apply for a license to expand the landfill. 
That license was approved by the department, and in November 2024, the environmental advocacy organization, along with the Penobscot Nation, appealed the department’s decision.
Last May, more than 50 people protested against the expansion, including residents of Old Town and the Penobscot Nation’s reservation at Indian Island, which includes portions of the Penobscot River and is located five miles downstream of the landfill.
Locals have argued that there has been insufficient treatment of landfill leachate — water that collects chemicals after passing through the waste — which runs into the Penobscot River. They are specifically concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals, which are linked to a number of negative health effects like some cancers, high cholesterol, reproductive and fetal development issues, and more. 
Friday’s ruling prevents the expansion plan from moving forward under its current approval, which would have added space to handle the equivalent of 8.6 Empire State Buildings-worth of trash to the landfill, according to Conservation Law Foundation.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6846-scaled-e1760632177850-1024x708.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

Now Newsom has announced $42 billion in new revenues over three years.,"When Gov. Gavin Newsom declared today that the state will likely receive an extra $42.3 billion in tax revenue over the next three years, thus alleviating a stubborn budget deficit, the inimitable Yogi Berra’s famous observation came to mind.
“It’s like déjà vu all over again,” Berra quipped in 1961, after watching Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, the New York Yankees’ star sluggers, hit back-to-back home runs.
Four years ago, as the state’s economy rebounded from a pandemic-caused downturn, the state’s revenues saw a brief upward spike. Someone in the administration, perhaps Newsom himself, decided that the revenue jump would be permanent and that it meant a $97.5 billion surplus over several years.
“No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this,” Newsom bragged as he unveiled a 2022-23 fiscal year budget that topped $300 billion.
Newsom’s declaration touched off a spending spree that boosted outlays by $14 billion. But the revenues never reached the assumed level and his Department of Finance eventually — and very quietly — acknowledged that the administration had overstated income by a whopping $165 billion over four years.
The additional spending, which outpaced real revenues, created what was dubbed a “structural deficit” in the annual $20 billion range ever since, covered with an array of accounting gimmicks, spending deferrals and raids on special funds and emergency reserves.
A few weeks ago, the Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, projected an $18 billion deficit for the 2026-27 fiscal year, rising to $35 billion later.
The draft budget that Newsom’s finance director, Joe Stephenshaw, outlined today would increase outlays by $27 billion over the current year to $321 billion, including a $248.3 billion general fund, up $20 billion.
The revenue increase projection, which Newsom mentioned in Thursday’s State of the State address, would cover all but $2.9 billion of the new spending plan, Stephenshaw said.
Simply put, if the budget’s projected $42.3 billion revenue increase is real, Newsom can conclude his governorship —– and probably segue into a presidential campaign — with the state’s finances no longer plagued by deficits.
Balancing the budget would also bolster Newsom’s opposition to calls from the left-leaning legislators and activists in his own party for tax increases to cover the shortfall and President Donald Trump’s cuts in federal health and welfare support.
However, we saw the corrosive effects of overestimating revenues in 2022, so the new forecast should be viewed skeptically.
Newsom hedges his bets by portraying the budget as a placeholder that covers little more than spending increases driven by law, inflation and caseload until more revenue data is received.
“While the budget is balanced in the 2026-27 fiscal year, with a discretionary reserve of $4.5 billion, it projects a deficit of roughly $22 billion in the 2027-28 fiscal year and shortfalls in the two years following,” the draft declares. “The administration intends to build on this budget proposal in May with a revised plan — reflecting updated revenue and spending data — that balances the budget in both the 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years with adequate budget reserves.”
Having been burned badly by his phantom surplus in 2022, Newsom is obviously aware that a repeat would be politically poisonous. His more cautious approach was symbolized by how the budget was presented.
In years past, Newsom would personally go through the budget, almost line-by-line, in presentations that sometimes lasted three hours. This time, he dispatched Stephenshaw to face reporters and characterize the budget as a draft that will be updated in May, as Newsom and the Legislature face a June 15 constitutional deadline for enactment.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010926-Budget-Presentation-FG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

This whitetail deer had its glads removed during an FWP event on Wednesday, Nov. 13. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Four new hunting districts across the state recorded a detection of Chronic Wasting Disease since July 2025, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said Friday.
The four districts were in FWP regions 3, 4 and 6. Those regions cover the south west, north central and northeast parts of the state. 
The department announced since July, there were 433 positive Chronic Wasting Disease tests out of 8,574 tests to date, an increase from last year, though FWP said it was too early to make any authoritative call on potential new trends.
“Without this data, the risk of CWD going undetected increases, which can lead to significant, long-term declines in herd health and hunting opportunities,” a recent FWP release said. “Proactive management based on hunter-submitted data is the only way to help ensure Montana’s big game populations remain resilient for future generations.”
Of the positive results, 250 were white-tailed deer, 179 were mule deer, and four were elk. 
As a comparison, from July 1, 2024, to March 25, 2025, there were 356 positive CWD tests on slightly less than 10,000 samples, according to the 2024 CWD report, published by FWP. However, the department said it’s important to note high concentrations of animals were tested in areas already known to have CWD.
The data helps biologists track where the disease is moving and guide where the agency might take management action, such as an extended season on a particular animal and where to concentrate their sampling efforts.
“We use the proportion of positive CWD tests from adult hunter-harvested animals to calculate prevalence in each hunting district,” Jacobsen wrote. “To calculate prevalences, we use data from the last three years. We also look at new detections in hunting districts.”
From July to present, the agency processed 8,574 samples, with 428 of those returning a positive test. The fourth week of the season, Nov. 13-19, saw 1,741 samples collected — the highest sampling week ever for that period. The agency processed samples from 4,537 white-tailed deer, 3,047 mule deer, 944 elk and 46 moose.
FWP wasn’t ready to make any determinations on prevalence of the disease compared to last year, as they need to clean the data — a report on the 2025 hunting season and CWD is expected this summer. There are still active hunts on some animals as well, which could also influence the data.
“We would like to thank our hunters and local communities for your collaboration with our seasonal CWD staff who handled collecting and receiving their samples throughout the season,” Sam Treece, FWP’s wildlife CWD technician supervisor, said in a press release. “We are sincerely grateful each and every year for your contributions in aiding the wildlife heritage of Montana.”
On average, hunters received their tests back in an average of 7.6 days.
CWD is a neurological disease that elk, deer and moose can be infected with, and it’s neither a virus or bacteria. Instead, it’s a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy — a naturally occurring protein, called a prion, that is not broken down by the animal the way it should be. 
The disease can be spread through contact with feces and other bodily fluids. Importantly, soil that has been contaminated with any of those fluids can also infect other animals. CWD is always fatal to the creature, and animals can spread the disease long before they develop symptoms. 
There isn’t a cure for the disease, and there’s been no recorded transmission of CWD to a human. However, meat from CWD-positive animals should still never be eaten.
There are several ways to get animals tested — hunters can remove an animals lymph nodes and mail them in, or bring the head to any FWP regional office. The results of the test can be then found online.
About 30% of Montana’s hunting districts have CWD-positive animals, and the state has invested significant resources into tracking the disease for nearly three decades.
Extended hunting season
FWP also recently announced it was extending the season on white-tail deer hunting in some parts of southwestern Montana due to a rise in CWD cases there.
The extended season runs through Feb. 15, 2026, in all of Hunting District 309 and portions of HDs 301, 304, 311 and 312. Those are primarily along the Gallatin River corridor where white-tailed deer are most concentrated, FWP said in a press release. The goal of the hunt is to reduce the white-tailed population density.
The agency also reminded hunters to check the specific boundaries of the CWD hunt and that there are weapon restrictions in Hunting District 309.
“Reducing deer numbers in key areas is one of the most effective tools we have to slow the spread of CWD,” Region 3 wildlife manager Warren Hansen said in a press release. “Early action improves our ability to keep disease prevalence low, protect mule deer and elk from potential spillover, and maintain a healthier deer herd overall.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FWP2-1024x688.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

But, it’s classified.
Federal regulators, and the U.S. Department of Justice attorneys representing them in court, offered little explanation for the abrupt suspension of five East Coast wind projects, including Revolution Wind, in court filings submitted Thursday. The tranche of documents, spanning 160 pages, defends the Interior Department’s Dec. 22 stop work order, which is being challenged by the Revolution Wind project developers, along with the companies behind three of the four other projects. The companies have each turned to federal courts to attempt to bar the Trump administration from interfering in their projects, claiming the 90-day suspension is an executive overreach that violates constitutional separation of powers, among other laws.
For the 65-turbine Revolution Wind project already 87% complete south of Rhode Island’s coastline, the late December halt to construction was especially harmful. The 704-megawatt project already endured a monthlong pause from August to September when federal regulators first sought to stop work under the guise of national security concerns. 
The initial stop work order was temporarily tossed by U.S. Senior Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Lamberth is scheduled to consider the second request for a preliminary injunction from the Revolution Wind developers, joined by the Rhode Island and Connecticut AGs, on Monday.
Ahead of the in-person hearing, Trump attorneys laid out their defense in writing to the court. They refuted allegations of constitutional breaches, and consequences for the project developers, who say they are at risk of losing $6 billion if construction cannot resume by Jan. 12.
The Trump administration’s response? 
“When it comes to the operation of the Project, the public interest in national security outweighs Revolution Wind’s alleged economic harms,” wrote Adam Gustafson, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the environment and natural resources division.










When it comes to the operation of the Project, the public interest in national security outweighs Revolution Wind’s alleged economic harms. 


– Statement by Adam Gustafson, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the environment and natural resources division, in court brief


But exactly what security concerns prompted the Trump administration to renege on the existing federal approval for the project remains fuzzy. The project had already undergone a rigorous and lengthy review of economic, environmental and security considerations.
Jacob Tyner, the Interior Department’s deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, pointed to a November 2025 assessment completed by the Department of War, the new name the Trump administration has given the Department of Defense. The assessment itself is classified. 
But according to Tyner, “This information included, among other things, discussion of the rapid evolution of relevant adversarial technologies and the direct impacts to national security that arise from the operation of offshore wind projects in proximity to early warning monitoring systems, and military and civilian radar systems.”
The findings set off a chain reaction: Defense leaders met with federal wind energy regulators to update them on the new analysis. Energy regulators then wrote to Revolution Wind and developers of four other projects to call for a 90-day pause because they “had not considered the specific national security risks” in prior reviews of the projects, Tyner wrote.
This despite documented analysis, and agreement, over how the towering turbines spinning in Rhode Island sound might affect military surveillance and radar systems by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) out of its operations center in Falmouth, Massachusetts.
A November 2024 agreement between the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force and the Revolution Wind developers outlined ways the parties agreed to mitigate potential radar concerns, including ongoing coordination and analysis of the acoustic monitoring equipment and fiber-optic cables used in the project constitution and operations. 
The agreement also called for the project developers to give $80,000 to the Defense Department within 10 days of completion for adverse effects from its project.
In exchange, the Defense Department agreed not to object or interfere with project construction and operation, as long as the developers’ remained in “material compliance.”
“As of the effective date of this agreement, Project Owner has disclosed to the DoD Parties in writing all material facts necessary for the DoD Parties to be able to fully assess the Project’s potential adverse impacts on military operations and readiness and risks to national security,” the agreement, signed Nov. 4 2024, states.
A second declaration from Dale Marks, deputy undersecretary of acquisition and sustainment for the Defense Department, might offer some clue what changed. But nearly all of the eight-page submission is redacted. A separate classified declaration — presumably without redactions — was submitted to the court for private review by the judge.
Burgum’s initial halt to construction set out a 90-day review timeline, though it acknowledged the possibility of extending the pause. But Tyner’s declaration hinted that a resolution may never come.
“At this time, BOEM is not aware whether the national security risks can be mitigated and, if they can, whether Developers would find the proposed mitigation measures acceptable,” Tyner wrote. “Further, any potential mitigation measures may be more effectively incorporated into the Revolution Wind Project before construction is completed.”
Also affected by the suspension order are Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind, both off New York’s coastline; Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking to resume their projects.

Free.,Landmark cases on transgender athletes at the US Supreme Court put trans rights on the line,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/landmark-cases-transgender-athletes-us-supreme-court-put-trans-rights-line,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of blockbuster cases to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court could carry far-reaching implications for transgender rights, even as the Trump administration during the past year has rolled out a broad anti-trans agenda targeting everything from sports to military service.The court on Jan. 13 will hear challenges to laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports. Both cases center on whether the laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.The West Virginia case before the Supreme Court also questions whether the state’s law violates Title IX — a landmark federal civil rights law that bars schools that receive federal funding from practicing sex-based discrimination. Lower court rulings have temporarily blocked the states from implementing the bans, to varying extents, and Republican attorneys general in Idaho and West Virginia have asked the Supreme Court to intervene. “We know we have an uphill fight, and our hope is certainly that we prevail,” Joshua Block, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project, who will be presenting oral arguments in the West Virginia case, said at a Jan. 8 ACLU press briefing. “But we also hope that regardless of what happens, this case isn’t successfully used as a tool to undermine the rights of transgender folks more generally in areas far beyond just athletics.” The outcome of the oral arguments before a court dominated 6-3 by conservative justices will be closely watched. Nearly 30 states have laws that ban trans students' participation in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent think tank.Idaho case  The justices are taking up both cases in one day. First will be Little v. Hecox, which contests a 2020 Idaho law that categorically bans trans athletes from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams. Lindsay Hecox sued over the ban in 2020, just months before the law was set to take effect. Though Hecox wanted to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, the Idaho law — the first of its kind in the nation — would have prevented her from doing so because she is transgender. A federal court in Idaho halted the law from taking effect later that year. A federal appeals court initially upheld the ruling in 2023 but later adjusted the scope of it in 2024 to only apply to Hecox, not other athletes. Idaho appealed to the Supreme Court in July 2024.Since that time, Hecox has asked both an Idaho federal court and the Supreme Court to drop the case. An Idaho federal judge in October rejected that attempt, but the Supreme Court deferred the request until after oral argument — meaning justices could still dismiss the case.“The Supreme Court is trying to decide whether Idaho can preserve women’s sports based on biological sex, or must female be redefined based on gender identity,” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said at a Jan. 8 press briefing ahead of the oral arguments.“I think Idaho is just trying to protect fairness, safety and equal protection for girls and women in sports,” Labrador said at the briefing alongside West Virginia Attorney General John McCuskey, hosted by the conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom.  West Virginia caseAfter the Idaho case, the justices will hear arguments in West Virginia v. B.P.J., which centers on a 2021 Mountain State law that also bans trans athletes from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams. McCuskey argued that his state’s law “supports and bolsters the original intent and the continuing intent and purpose of Title IX.” McCuskey said the law complies with the Equal Protection Clause because it “treats all biological males and all biological females identically” and “doesn’t ban anyone from playing sports.” Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was 11 at the time, wanted to try out for the girls' cross-country team when starting middle school, but would have been prevented from doing so under the West Virginia law because she is transgender. Her mother sued on her behalf in 2021.A federal appeals court in 2024 barred West Virginia from enforcing the ban, prompting the state to ask the nation’s highest court to intervene.  White House, Congress zero in on trans athletesMeanwhile, President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps at the federal level to prohibit trans athletes’ participation in women’s sports teams aligning with their gender identity. Trump signed an executive order in February 2025 that banned such participation and made it the policy of the United States to “rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.”The NCAA promptly changed its policy to comply with the order, limiting “competition in women’s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.” In late 2024, prior to the policy shift, NCAA President Charlie Baker told Congress that of the more than half-million total athletes in NCAA schools, he knew of fewer than 10 who were transgender. The GOP-led House passed a measure in January 2025 that would bar transgender students from participating on women’s school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. But Senate Democrats in March blocked an attempt at imposing such a ban and codifying Trump’s executive order. Forty-eight GOP members of Congress argued in a September amicus brief supporting Idaho and West Virginia that “if allowed to stand, the interpretation of the lower courts will unsettle the very promises that Congress made to generations of young women and men through Title IX.” On the flip side, 130 congressional Democrats stood behind the two transgender athletes in a November amicus brief, noting that “categorical bans preventing transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity impose significant harm on all children — especially girls.” The group argued that such bans “do not meet the standards this Court has put in place to assess discrimination based on sex — whether as a matter of Title IX or under the Equal Protection Clause.” Trump’s broader anti-trans agenda has extended beyond athletic participation in the nearly one year since he took office. He signed executive orders that: make it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female;” restrict access to gender-affirming care for kids; and aim to bar openly transgender service members from the U.S. military. ‘Textbook discrimination’ The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, has noted that there has been “considerable disinformation and misinformation about what the inclusion of transgender youth in sports entails” and that trans students’ sports participation “has been a non-issue.”In a statement ahead of oral arguments, HRC’s senior director of legal policy Cathryn Oakley said “every child, no matter their background, race, or gender, should have access to a quality education where they can feel safe to learn and grow — and for many kids that involves being a part of a school sports team.”Oakley added that “to deny transgender kids the chance to participate in school sports alongside their peers simply because of who they are is textbook discrimination — and it’s unconstitutional.”",,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Photo by Annice Lyn/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — In South Carolina, 16- and 17-year-olds can’t smoke, open a credit card or vote, but they can get married under a law some legislators and advocates are trying to change.
Until 2019, a loophole in state law allowed judges to issue marriage licenses to children of any age if they were pregnant or gave birth, allowing thousands to get married over the course of two decades. A law passed that year made clear that only those 16 and up could get married, with parental permission.
But as more states do away with underage marriage altogether, some are pushing South Carolina to set a firm floor of 18 years old.
Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto is trying again to get a bill he’s proposed during every two-year session since 2019 past the finish line. The proposal didn’t get a hearing during last year’s legislative session.
“I think that (marriage) is one of the biggest decisions anyone will ever make,” the Orangeburg Democrat said. “It should be done by someone whose mind is fully developed.”
Teenagers don’t magically wake up more mature on their 18th birthday than they were at 17, said Alex Goyette with Tahirih Justice Center, who advocates for bills raising the minimum marriage age.
But 18-year-olds have more opportunities than 17-year-olds. As someone who’s considered an adult by law, an 18-year-old can hire a lawyer and sign other legal documents on their own. Finding an apartment is easier, as is finding a full-time job, Goyette said.
“That’s really important for someone who is trying to resist an unwanted marriage or to leave an abusive situation,” he said.
Since Delaware became the first state to set a minimum age of 18 for marriage in 2018, 15 states have followed suit, according to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit center, which works to protect women from violence and help victims. Five of those states did so within the past year.
South Carolina is one of 20 states that allows people as young as 16 to get married. Six states allow marriage as young as 15 or don’t have an age limit at all, according to the advocacy group.
The biggest challenge the advocacy group faces is time. Bills about their states’ legal marrying age generally aren’t among legislators’ top priorities, making it more difficult to get a hearing scheduled amid the frequent chaos of a part-year legislative session, Goyette said.
But the issue is an important one, with the potential for far-reaching impacts, he added.
Girls married before turning 18 are more likely to face domestic abuse than their counterparts, according to studies Tahirih Justice Center compiled. Marrying young often separates girls from support networks they might otherwise form through school, friends and family, making it more difficult for many to get help, Goyette said.
Underage brides are also less likely to finish high school or attend college, more likely to live in poverty, and more susceptible to long-term mental and physical health problems, according to the nonprofit.
“This, obviously, has devastating lifelong harms,” Goyette said.
Between 70% and 80% of marriages that include someone under the age of 18 end in divorce, the advocacy group found.
“These are not the foundational lifelong partnerships that we like to think of when we’re talking about a marriage,” Goyette said.
As more states raise the legal age for marriage, Goyette worries people may start traveling to South Carolina to take advantage of its comparatively lax laws about marrying underage, he said.
Some of South Carolina’s neighboring states have already approved stricter laws.
In Georgia, marriage is limited to those who are 18 and older. Tennessee and Florida both have age floors of 17. North Carolina also has a minimum marriage age of 16, but its law includes more safeguards, including allowing the other spouse to be no more than four years older and requiring a judge to evaluate whether the marriage “serves the best interest” of the person under 18.
South Carolina’s law does not include such safeguards that could prevent some unwanted marriages, Goyette said. As long as a minor’s parent signs off, any certified official can issue a 16-year-old a marriage license in the state.
“Until every state moves on this issue, kids across the United States are in danger,” Goyette said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/end-child-marriages-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmaker Jared Storm of David City has asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand progressive lawmaker Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha for removing and later returning part of a Nebraska Capitol display on American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.
Earlier this week, Cavanaugh said she removed the frames because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.” She said generally any such display would be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways.

“Such conduct is unbecoming of a member of the Nebraska Legislature…. elected officials should be held to a higher standard than members of the general public,” said Storm on the floor. 
Cavanaugh said she tried not to damage the artwork and called the Nebraska State Patrol to let them know where the paintings were. The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, and the images were rehung. No “apparent damage” was done to the art. 
Storm, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature where the GOP holds a supermajority, said he thinks her actions ares a serious matter that needs to be addressed. 
“I think there are a lot of people in the state and nationwide that were upset to see those items pulled off the wall,” Storm told the Examiner. “They want to see some consequences.”

Cavanaugh declined to comment to the Examiner. She was seen talking to Storm and lawmakers on the floor as lawmakers worked on filing bills. She later said she apologized to lawmakers personally. 
Before lawmakers adjourned for the day Friday, Cavanaugh went to the mic on the floor and expressed remorse for what she did on the first day. 
“I should not have done [it] … I have regretted it pretty much ever since, and I regret putting all of my colleagues in the position to have to deal with the repercussions of my actions,” Cavanaugh said. “ I hope to do better. I appreciate the grace that you all have given me this morning in talking with me, and I hope that we can move forward in a productive way for the remainder of this session. I don’t want to be what stands between us and good policy for the people of Nebraska.”

The Executive Board met after lawmakers adjourned for the day. State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said the issues will be discussed in a closed meeting of the board but said Cavanaugh’s apologies were “sincere.”
Nebraska lawmakers are dealing with trying to close the state’s $471 million budget hole and weighing whether to expel a fellow lawmaker for the first time in state history, State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst. 
His expulsion hearing is set for Monday. 
Speaker John Arch of La Vista said the PragerU display is allowed in the Capitol with approval from the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which the exhibit had. 
The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota prosecutors are asking the public for evidence in the killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent on Wednesday after the Trump administration froze local law enforcement out of the investigation.
“Every moment in these cases is precious,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison at a news conference in Minneapolis on Friday. “If you have information bearing on the outcome of this matter in any way, please share it.”
The Attorney General’s Office and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office set up a portal for people to submit photos, videos and other evidence they think may help prosecutors understand the case and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will catalogue the submissions.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings and was on the scene at Portland Avenue near 34th Street collecting evidence after an ICE officer, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her Honda Pilot.
But on Thursday, the agency announced the U.S. Attorney’s Office had made the unusual decision that the FBI would be the sole investigative agency, effectively freezing out local law enforcement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” BCA superintendent Drew Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz and other state Democrats have expressed doubt that the public could trust the results of an investigation conducted solely by the federal government.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a Thursday news conference that local officials “have not been cut out. They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”
The standoff over jurisdiction adds to a contentious fight between state leaders and the Trump administration over fraud in state social service programs and a surge of thousands of federal agents and officers in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty emphasized that local officials have the authority to both investigate the shooting and potentially bring criminal charges based on the evidence.
“We do have jurisdiction,” Moriarty said. “We cannot make any decision, however, if there is not evidence submitted to our office.”
Moriarty said the FBI has possession of key evidence, including Good’s car and the shell casings from the officer’s gun. She also acknowledged they have really no access to federal law enforcement officers for interviews.
She said she does not have concerns about the integrity of the FBI, but rather that they won’t turn over their findings for state prosecutors to review.
“In the past, the FBI has invited us to see a high level overview of their investigation, but we were prohibited from seeing the entire investigation or talking about what we saw,” Moriarty said.
Prosecutions of federal law enforcement officers are also complicated by the fact that they have immunity from state prosecution for carrying out their duties.
But legal experts emphasize that immunity does not extend to officers who use unreasonable and excessive force.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_862-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:12:47.376567

Where does all this information about my legislators come from?
My Legislator is powered by the Digital Democracy database. It combines a variety of information and data from throughout state government that is publicly available but isolated and difficult to access. This database combines these related data sources so they can be compared to reveal relationships, patterns and aberrations in the Legislature and the policy-making process. 
The database includes four categories of information: transcripts, bill information, financial information and district data. Get a full breakdown on our Digital Democracy data sources and methodology page.
How are legislator rankings calculated?
We use standard competition (“1224”) ranking to determine legislators’ ranks. All legislators with the same value (e.g. number of bills passed) share the same rank, after which a gap is left in the ranking numbers. For example, if two legislators tie for the second-most bills passed, the ranks will be 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, and so on (skipping 3).
This means that if there are last-place ties, the lowest rank will not be 120, the total number of California legislators. Depending on how many people make up last-place ties, the lowest rank may be different across categories.  
How is legislator bipartisanship calculated?
Our bipartisanship scoring is based on bill authorship records. We count the number of instances in which a legislator of one party authors or co-authors a bill version with a member of another party. For example, if a Democrat legislator was the lead author for a bill version and Republican legislators are recorded as co-authors, then we consider that an instance of bipartisanship.
Lead authors are primarily responsible for the content of the bill and guiding it through the legislative process. Co-authors are legislators who, with the permission of the lead authors, add their name to the bill in a show of support for the bill; they are not usually responsible for the specific wording of the bill.
There are three combinations that we count as instances of bipartisanship:

Republican lead author(s) with Democrat lead author(s)
Republican lead author(s) with Democrat co-author(s)
Democrat lead author(s) with Republican co-author(s)

Each bill version that matches one of the three combinations counts as one instance, increasing the scores of all involved legislators by one. Then, we rank the legislators based on their final scores.
What are “noteworthy” votes of the week?
Lawmakers may cast hundreds of votes in a week, more than can reasonably fit into a newsletter. We use a range of metrics from Digital Democracy to assess which of your legislators’ votes to highlight, including: 

Bills with votes that diverge from any legislators’ past voting patterns
Intensity of discussions on bills, such as the number and length of back-and-forth debates between speakers
Number and influence of organizations taking positions on bills
Bills’ relevance to current news coverage or ongoing policy debates 
Amount of text added to and removed from bills
Overall number of speakers during legislative discussions

What do the bill statuses mean?
The PASS and FAIL statuses that we show in the newsletter indicate the vote results by a particular committee or chamber. 
A failed vote does not necessarily mean that the bill has died and cannot move forward. Committees can vote to reconsider a bill that they had not originally passed.
In order for a bill to get to the governor’s desk, the same version of the bill must pass both Senate and Assembly floors at least once.
Can I sign up for more than two legislators?
Right now, you can only sign for one state senator and one assemblymember per email address. If you’re interested in tracking more than two legislators, you can sign up for the newsletter using another email address.

Hoskins’ lawyer, Kathleen Hunker of the attorney general’s office, made the admission during a hearing in a court case challenging the ballot summary and said it would be revised in negotiations with sponsors of the referendum.
“On a further reflection of the ballot title, the secretary has come to believe that the language, though defensible, does come close enough to the line of being inherently argumentative and likely to create prejudice,” Hunker told Cole County Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe. “That means we can do better, and so we are going to withdraw our opposition to the plaintiff’s claim about how the language is inherently argumentative.”
A political action committee called People Not Politicians on Dec. 9 turned in more than 300,000 signatures to force a statewide vote on the redistricting plan Republicans muscled through a September special session. The PAC objected to the ballot summary as soon as it became public and filed a lawsuit on Nov. 20. 
Chuck Hatfield, attorney for People Not Politicians, told Stumpe that Hoskins will have to admit more — that the language he wrote is insufficient and unfair — to meet the standards for revising the summary.
“Your honor can’t enter an order just because it’s close to the line,” Hatfield said. “We’re going to have to have a finding that it’s insufficient and unfair. And I’m asking them to agree to that, and if they don’t, then we need a trial.”
The case before Stumpe was scheduled for a trial next Friday. He set a new date, Feb. 9, in case there is no agreement on what the revised summary should say.
Denny Hoskins isn’t verifying one-third of signatures for vote on Missouri’s gerrymandered map

The ballot summary written by Hoskins asks if voters approve the law, “which repeals Missouri’s existing gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbent politicians, and replaces it with new congressional boundaries that keep more cities and counties intact, are more compact, and better reflects statewide voting patterns?”
People Not Politicians objects to the characterization of the reapportionment made in 2022 as a “gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbents” and the factual basis for saying it keeps more cities and counties intact. The bill itself is just a list of voting districts and counties assigned to each district and the summary Hoskins wrote cannot be found in its contents, the PACs court filings state.
The summary’s statement about statewide voting patterns also brought objections. Recent elections gave Republicans about 60% of the vote and Democrats about 40%. The new map would give Democrats 12.5% of the state delegation instead of one-quarter.
Republicans want the new congressional map to please President Donald Trump, who demanded the changes as a means to protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Republicans currently hold six of the eight seats.
If People Not Politicians and Hoskins’ office can agree on the factual basis for changing the summary, it would end the case but not litigation over the special session and the congressional map.
There are at least eight other lawsuits, six in state court and two in federal court, directly or indirectly related to the actions of the legislature or People Not Politicians.
The most recently filed case challenges assertions by Hoskins and Attorney General Catherine Hanaway that the map passed in September took effect on Dec. 11, 90 days after the end of the special session.
In that case, filed by the ACLU of Missouri, the state is accusing People Not Politicians and Hatfield of encouraging a lawsuit the PAC could not bring on its own. It has subpoenaed Hatfield, People Not Politicians Director Richard von Glahn and the PAC for records the state believes will show the connection.
“The state believes that PNP, Von Glahn or their agents recruited (the ACLU plaintiffs) as proxies to bring this lawsuit,” Solicitor General Louis Capozzi wrote in one filing in the case.
And the state is seeking sanctions against Hatfield in a federal case dismissed in early December that sought to block the petition drive entirely. In the federal filing, Capozzi argued that Hatfield admitted in federal court that the map would take effect even if signatures were submitted to force a vote.
“Yet during the following days, defendants and Mr. Hatfield personally have aggressively and repeatedly communicated the opposite position to the media, stating unambiguously that their mere act of submitting referendum signatures immediately froze (the redistricting law) and prevented it from going into effect,” Capozzi wrote.
In the Friday hearing before Stumpe, Hatfield noted that Capozzi is seeking sanctions and making accusations that he or People Not Politicians is sponsoring the case over when the map takes effect. The order from Stumpe directing Hoskins to revise the ballot summary needs to settle all legal issues in the case, he said.
“Mr. Capozzi sought sanctions against me in federal court, and he’s either confused about what happened in federal court, or he’s intentionally misrepresenting what happened in federal court,” Hatfield said. “I’m assuming he’s confused about what happened, and I don’t want any confusion here.”
There is also confusion over which of the more than 300,000 signatures will be checked to see if the referendum petition meets the threshold of approximately 110,000 signatures spread over six congressional districts. 
In court, and in media statements, Hoskins and his attorneys have said only signature pages with at least one signature dated Oct. 14 or later will be checked. Hoskins approved the form of the petition on Oct. 13.
Of the 49,773 pages with signatures, 33,068 have been sent to local election authorities to verify whether the signatures are from registered voters. The rest, Hoskins’ office said Friday in a statement to The Independent, “having invalid dates were scanned, retained, and organized separately.”
Speaking on KMOX radio on Wednesday morning, Hoskins repeated the statement that signatures aren’t being checked.
“We’re not counting those,” Hoskins said. “And, you know, unless a judge issues a court order and says, hey, yes, you must count these. But otherwise, we’ve set those aside. They should not count toward that referendum.“
But in statements to People Not Politicians, Chrissy Peters, Hoskins’ director of elections, said the pages retained in the secretary of state’s office are being checked for signature verification.
In a statement intended to clarify the confusion, Rachael Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, said Friday that no signature checks are being made in Hoskins to determine if the petition has sufficient signatures to be placed on the ballot. 
She said only signatures on pages sent to local election authorities will be counted.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A new public opinion survey of 600 likely Republican primary voters shows Naples U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is running away with the 2026 Republican race for governor.
Donalds, who was elected to Florida’s 19th Congressional District in 2020, leads Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis — who has not declared a candidacy for governor — by “only” 13 points, 39%-26%, in a poll conducted by Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, a GOP political polling firm.
However, when voters are informed that Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump, his lead swells to 58 points, 68%-10%.
When GOP voters were asked how they would vote were the gubernatorial race held today, Donalds leads investment firm CEO James Fishback, 47%-5%. His lead leaps to 76%-6% over Fishback when voters are informed about the Trump endorsement. Former House Speaker Paul Renner gets 4%, but that number drops to 1% when informed about the Trump endorsement.
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins has discussed entering the race, but has yet to do so. The pollsters write that despite a high-profile series of television ads promoting him that aired in the last part of 2025, the needle hasn’t moved at all for the LG.
“Any sugar high from Jay Collins’ multimillion ad buy has completely dissipated,” they write. “Virtually no RPVs [Republican primary voters] recall seeing anything about Collins (only 16%) and Donalds crushes him in every ballot permutation.”
There have been no major polls of the Democratic primary race, which features former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)After Idaho’s top election official gave the federal government a list of all Idaho registered voters that scrubbed their personal information, the U.S. Department of Justice says it wants the unredacted list.
The Justice Department offered Idaho a deal that would let the federal law enforcement agency audit the state’s voter rolls. And a Justice Department attorney hinted the agency could sue Idaho — like it has sued 23 other states — if election officials don’t turn over the full records that the Trump administration demanded. That’s according to communications in December that the Idaho Capital Sun obtained through a public records request.
Trump’s DOJ offers states confidential deal to remove voters flagged by feds

Since then, Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said his office and the Justice Department have been negotiating over whether and how to share Idaho’s full data — which he portrayed as a complex legal issue. He said he isn’t nervous that his office will be sued, but it could happen.
“Every indication to me is that we are having a good dialogue. And they seem to be willing, there’s a willingness with them to engage with us in that dialogue,” McGrane told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Tuesday. “And so at the moment, I’m not nervous that we’re going to be sued, but it’s always a possibility.”
In September, the U.S. Justice Department asked states to turn over their full voter registration records — with identifiable information on registered voters. 
The Justice Department says it wants Idaho’s data to ensure election integrity. But as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, some fear how the federal government will use the data. Trump has falsely claimed that droves of noncitizens vote, a crime which is actually rare nationally and in Idaho.  
The Justice Department did not directly respond to the Idaho Capital Sun’s questions about its negotiations with Idaho, or whether the agency would sue the state.
“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”

 ‘You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week,’ Justice Department attorney tells Idaho official

After the Justice Department first asked for Idaho’s data, McGrane only gave the Justice Department access to a de-identified voter registration list, which the agency routinely shares with people and organizations that request it. 
“After consulting with the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, we will be sharing a copy of our publicly available file, which does not contain any personally identifiable information,” McGrane wrote to the Justice Department in a Sept. 22 letter. “We welcome a dialogue with your office to continue to discuss the broader efforts to ensure the accuracy of Idaho’s voter rolls.”

But more than a month later, the Justice Department re-upped its request for Idaho’s full voter rolls. 
On Dec. 4, David Vandenberg, an attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, was calling to follow up on getting Idaho’s full voter registration list.
“You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week for refusing to provide their voter registration lists,” Vandenberg said in a Dec. 4 voicemail to former Idaho Chief Deputy Secretary of State Robert McQuade. “And we’re preparing additional lawsuits. I’d like to keep everyone out of that as much as possible. But I haven’t heard anything back from you all.”
Days later, on Dec. 8, he sent an email to McQuade saying the Justice Department “is requiring an unredacted copy of Idaho’s statewide voter-registration list by Friday, December 12, 2025, as previously demanded.”
Less than an hour later, McQuade replied by detailing Idaho’s efforts to purge noncitizens from the state’s voter roll, which stemmed from a 2024 executive order by Gov. Brad Little. 
“After working closely with the Idaho Department of Transportation and using” a federal immigration database called SAVE, “we worked to verify citizenship for all of Idaho’s 1.1 million registered voters. Following this work, we provided data on approximately 30 individuals to the Idaho State Police (ISP) for investigation as possible non-citizen registrants/voters,” McQuade wrote. 
The number of suspected noncitizen voters in Idaho referred for prosecution was even smaller. 
“It’s our understanding that once the investigation was completed, around August or September of this year, ISP referred about a dozen or so folks to the U.S. Attorney’s Office here in Idaho for possible prosecution,” he added. “We have not heard where these investigations have led since.”
The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office is still verifying citizenship “on all newly registered voters prior to each election to ensure only citizens vote,” he added.    



 Idaho Department of Health and Welfare gave the feds fully identifiable data on SNAP enrolees

Months before the Justice Department sought state voter registration lists, the U.S. Department of Agriculture asked states for help to build a database for managing a food benefits program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps.

USDA told states its request — stemming from an executive order in March by President Donald Trump that focused on stopping fraud, waste and abuse — was to build a database meant to “strengthen SNAP and government program integrity,” according to a July 9 letter USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins sent Idaho. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare gave USDA identifiable information, including enrollee’s names, addresses, birth days, Social Security numbers and eligibility information like income and expense data, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun.
Like the Justice Department’s request for voter rolls, USDA’s request was a first for Idaho.
“This is the first time that USDA has asked for information on our entire caseload,” McWhorter said. 
Asked what the USDA has done with Idaho’s SNAP data, a USDA spokesperson who requested to not be named said: “We will not comment on pending litigation.”
 



 Why Idaho’s Secretary of State says sharing the state’s full voter roll is complicated

In an interview Tuesday, McGrane said his office has since been in talks with the Justice Department. The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office hasn’t shared more data or promised to yet, he said.
The Justice Department also in December offered Idaho a deal to share the data that would direct state election officials to remove voters deemed allegedly ineligible from the state’s voter registration roll. The Justice Department has offered similar, confidential deals to at least 11 other states, Stateline reported.

Idaho’s deal would allow the Justice Department to audit the state’s voter rolls, and would direct state election officials to purge alleged ineligible voters. McGrane said he hasn’t signed the deal. He said he hasn’t seen the Justice Department do this under any other presidential administration.
But he said he’s “very confident in Idaho’s processes for verifying voter information with very clean voter rolls.”
Part of Idaho’s talks with the Justice Department revolve around legal issues specific to Idaho around sharing voter lists, McGrane said. For one, because Idaho offers same-day voter registration on election days, the state is exempt from the National Voter Registration Act, which McGrane said is among the main authorities that the Justice Department has leveraged to get voter data from states. He said Idaho law also limits how the state shares voter lists with third-party entities, requiring certain security measures. 
In September, when McGrane only shared Idaho’s redacted voter list, he touted Idaho’s efforts to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. As part of that, his office already works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship.
“It’s not as clear what DOJ’s intentions are at this point, other than saying they’re auditing all the states,” McGrane said. “And so we’re just making sure that we do that, and that any data that we would share with them is handled securely, and that it’s protecting voter information.”
In a statement last week, Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre said the Trump administration is prioritizing enforcing election laws.
“Enforcing the Nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the Civil Rights Division. Congress gave the Justice Department authority under” several federal laws, including the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act and the Civil Rights Act, “to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections,” she said. “The recent request by the Civil Rights Division for state voter rolls is pursuant to that statutory authority, and the responsive data is being screened for ineligible voter entries.”

La representación del profesorado en Cal State está muy rezagada respecto al creciente número de estudiantes latinos. Esto supone una carga para los pequeños círculos de profesorado latino que asumen más tareas de mentoría, muchas veces en puestos sin titularidad y con salarios más bajos.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En la última década, los latinos en el sistema de la Universidad Estatal de California no han representado más del 15% de todos los instructores, aun cuando representaron casi la mitad del cuerpo estudiantil en los últimos años.
Incluso en Cal State Los Ángeles, donde en 2024 un enorme 75% de su población estudiantil era latina, solo alrededor de una cuarta parte de su personal docente lo era, según datos de Cal State compilados por CalMatters. El número de estudiantes latinos ha crecido a un ritmo acelerado, y todos los 22 campus de Cal State, excepto unoEditSign , se han clasificado como Instituciones al Servicio de los Hispanos, lo que significa que al menos el 25% de los estudiantes universitarios de tiempo completo son latinos, y la mayoría son de bajos recursos. Algunos profesores latinos afirman que tienen un peso adicional, ya que son buscados desproporcionadamente por estudiantes latinos para mentoría. Esto también puede recaer sobre los profesores de tiempo parcial y completo, que constituyen la mayor parte del profesorado latino, pero tienen un salario más bajo, incluso aquellos que trabajan a tiempo completo y asumen tareas adicionales.
 “Cuando puedes ver a latinos que se parecen a ti, que tal vez tienen el mismo punto de partida, la misma experiencia de vida que tú, puedes ver lo que es posible”, dijo Feliza Ortiz-Licon, quien ha trabajado durante mucho tiempo con estudiantes universitarios de primera generación y ahora es vicepresidenta ejecutiva de la Campaña para la Oportunidad Universitaria, una organización sin fines de lucro de California que aboga por el acceso y la finalización equitativos de los estudios universitarios.
El profesorado afirma que las principales barreras para acceder a la docencia incluyen la escasa mentoría y la escasa promoción de los programas que les ayudan a obtener su doctorado. Además, estos programas ofrecen plazas limitadas. Las normas culturales subyacentes también han disuadido a generaciones de latinos de ingresar al mundo académico. Los campus de Cal State han continuado sus esfuerzos para diversificar el profesorado, por ejemplo, mediante la contratación por grupos o “clusters”, en la que se contrata a grupos de profesores por sus áreas de especialización y trayectorias específicas.
 Aun así, estos esfuerzos han hecho poco para aumentar el número de profesores latinos.
 Por ejemplo, en el otoño de 2024, Cal State contaba con 27,505 instructores, pero solo 4,079 eran latinos. Para alcanzar la paridad con el número de estudiantes latinos, el sistema habría necesitado 13,477 educadores latinos.


 ¿Por qué hay tan pocos latinos en la academia?
Amy Bentley-Smith, portavoz de Cal State, señala el bajo número de latinos que ingresan a programas de posgrado a nivel nacional. En 2023, los latinos representaban solo alrededor del 14% de los estudiantes de posgrado a nivel nacional, según un informe del Consejo de Escuelas de Posgrado.
 CalMatters intentó hablar con varios funcionarios de la Oficina del Canciller de Cal State, pero el portavoz indicó que no estaban disponibles para ser entrevistados para este artículo. En su lugar, Bentley-Smith envió la siguiente respuesta por correo electrónico: “Hemos sido líderes durante mucho tiempo en abrir puertas a las oportunidades y aumentar el acceso a la educación superior entre todos los californianos, incluidas las poblaciones históricamente subrepresentadas”, escribió Bentley-Smith. Agregó que Cal State supera consistentemente el porcentaje nacional de profesores hispanos, que representaron alrededor del 6% de todos los empleados a tiempo completo en 2023, según el Centro Nacional de Estadísticas de Educación.
Entre los pocos latinos con títulos avanzados, el 10 % ha obtenido un doctorado, según un análisis del Pew Research Center de los datos de la Encuesta sobre la Comunidad Estadounidense de 2021. Generalmente, se requiere una maestría para dar clases en Cal State, y un doctorado para un puesto de profesor titular. En sus investigaciones a lo largo de los años, la Campaña por la Oportunidad Universitaria ha atribuido el bajo nivel educativo de los latinos a las altas tasas de pobrezaEditSign , las presiones para trabajar y mantener a la familia y la falta de acceso a recursos e informaciónEditSign para acceder a la educación superior.

Y luego está el síndrome del impostor. Desde que empezó a trabajar como asesora académica en la facultad de negocios de Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Yesenia Márquez-Beas ha visto a innumerables estudiantes llegar a su puerta sintiéndose que no se merecen triunfar en el aula. Considera que esas dudas son mucho más comunes entre los estudiantes latinos que entre otros.
 “Quizás nuestra latinidad nos está frenando un poco para salir a buscar posiciones que vemos tan lejanas”, dijo Márquez-Beas.
 Progresar a través del ámbito académico hacia la docencia rara vez es parte de la conversación cuando se trata de caminos después de la graduación, dijo Márquez-Beas.
 Muchos latinos se rigen por ciertas normas culturales, señaló Ortiz-Licon, de la Campaña por la Oportunidad Universitaria. “No quiero molestar” es una de ellas. Este enfoque mantiene a los estudiantes reacios a buscar ayuda o mentores, dijo Ortiz-Licon, quien en su momento fue estudiante de primera generación.
 Anthonio Reyes, presidente del gobierno estudiantil de Cal State Bakersfield, estuvo de acuerdo en que muchos estudiantes latinos de primera generación tienen el “mal hábito” de no hablar sobre sus problemas. Después de la secundaria en Bakersfield, Reyes asistió a la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco, donde se sintió aislado e incapaz de buscar ayuda de sus profesores. “Eso es algo muy importante en la comunidad: uno no pide ayuda simplemente”, dijo Reyes.
 El segundo año de Reyes en la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco se vio interrumpido por la COVID-19, por lo que tuvo que regresar a casa y empezar a trabajar. Trabajó durante cuatro años antes de matricularse en Cal State Bakersfield para estudiar música, donde encontró un ambiente más acogedor.
 Es por eso que, como presidente del gobierno estudiantil, Reyes a menudo les dice a los líderes del campus que deben ser proactivos para ayudar a los estudiantes de primera generación. 
 El déficit crea un peso adicional sobre el profesorado latino
 Como los estudiantes tienden a buscar educadores con antecedentes similares, la brecha genera una mayor carga de trabajo para un pequeño grupo de instructores de color. Y los profesores podrían asumir esta tarea aunque no esté contemplada en su descripción de funciones.
 “Hay mucha carga cultural. Ese es el mayor problema de la falta de diversidad en la educación superior: el profesorado diverso asume más trabajo”, dijo Dirk Horn, profesor latino de ciencias políticas en Cal State Bakersfield. Esto también puede obstaculizar el apoyo a algunos aprendices, ansiosos por encontrar a alguien con quien puedan identificarse culturalmente.

 “He tenido como dos mentores latinos en total y estoy tratando de conectarme con otra, pero está muy ocupada”, dijo Isabella Cantu, una estudiante de doctorado latina que estudia sociología en UC Davis con la esperanza de unirse algún día a la facultad de Cal State.
 José Navarro, director del departamento de estudios étnicos de Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, creía cuando era estudiante que la educación podía ser transformadora, pero que cursar estudios superiores era como “entrar en una habitación muy, muy, muy oscura” en la que no podía transitar por sí solo.
 Como profesor titular, Navarro se desempeña como asesor académico y mentor, además de impartir docencia. Si bien a veces trabaja hasta altas horas de la noche o desde casa, Navarro lo considera más una necesidad que una carga.
 “Lo último que quiero es que algún estudiante de color entre, como me pasó a mí, en esa habitación completamente oscura que es el sistema universitario”, dijo Navarro.
 “El muerto entre muchos no pesa”, dijo Navarro. Dijo que así se siente en Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, donde la representación latina es limitada, pero el peso del servicio y la mentoría es más ligero cuando hay otros ahí para apoyar.
 Los latinos en Cal State tienen menos probabilidades de ocupar puestos con permanencia, que se espera que involucren asesoría académica e investigación. En otoño de 2024, los latinos representaban el 12% del profesorado con permanencia, mientras que los blancos representaban más de la mitad. Sin embargo, los blancos representaban el 20% de la población estudiantil de Cal State.
 Los profesores titulares influyen en decisiones importantes de la universidad, como la evaluación de la contratación y los ascensos del profesorado. Además, gozan de mayor estabilidad laboral, afirmó Navarro. Por otro lado, los profesores a tiempo completo cobran menos y tienen una mayor carga de trabajo docente.


Pero profesores como Horn mantienen sus puertas abiertas para sus alumnos voluntariamente.
 Horn colabora con el Senado Académico del campus, forma parte de comités y asesora a los clubes estudiantiles del campus, todo ello sin remuneración adicional. Sin posibilidad de titularidad, Horn también siente incertidumbre sobre su estabilidad laboral. Monitorea los presupuestos estatales y las tasas de matriculación para evaluar las probabilidades: en un déficit fiscal, ¿sería él el primero en ser despedido? 
 Lograr que más latinos ingresen al mundo académico
 “Creo que, más que nada, la mentoría es importante”, dijo Cantu, estudiante de UC Davis. “No solo ver la representación, sino sentir ese apoyo y tener a alguien que comprende tus antecedentes y tus orígenes”.
 Ella atribuye la mentoría que recibió de un programa nacional, la Beca de Pregrado Mellon Mays , por impulsarla a convertirse en profesora. Actualmente es becaria del Programa de Incentivos Doctorales del Rector, uno de los dos programas de Cal State que ayudan a los aspirantes a profesorado a obtener títulos avanzados.
Horn, profesor de Cal State Bakersfield, también participó en el programa de incentivos para el doctorado.Le proporcionó fondos para centrarse en los estudios mientras cursaba su doctorado en UC Irvine.
 Su camino hacia el doctorado fue accidentado. Su padre esperaba que Horn contribuyera económicamente a la familia, así que, en lugar de matricularse en la preparatoria, trabajó a tiempo completo mientras cursaba estudios secundarios para obtener su GED. Cinco años después de obtener su GED, cuando la salud de su padre se deterioraba, Horn se dio cuenta de que un título universitario podría brindarle a él y a su familia mayor estabilidad financiera. Asistió a un colegio comunitario y luego se transfirió a Cal State Bakersfield, donde encontró mentores que lo animaron a cursar estudios de posgrado.

 Horn pospuso su graduación para unirse al Programa de Logros Post-bachillerato Ronald E. McNair , financiado con fondos federales, que ayuda a preparar a estudiantes de primera generación y subrepresentados para estudios de posgrado.
 De los 35 estudiantes aceptados en el programa de incentivos de doctorado de Cal State este año académico, el 54 % son latinos, el 24 % asiáticos, el 19 % blancos y el 3 % afroamericanos, según Bentley-Smith. El programa ofrece mentoría, acceso a becas y premios financieros por miles de dólares, así como oportunidades profesionales para estudiantes que cursan un doctorado. También pueden recibir un préstamo opcional que se condona si el becario es profesor en Cal State. De los becarios anteriores del programa, el 69 % obtuvo puestos docentes en los campus de Cal State después de obtener su doctorado. 
Las contrataciones en grupo ayudan a impulsar la diversidad, cuando hay financiamiento
Algunos campus de Cal State, como Bakersfield y San Luis Obispo , han implementado la contratación por grupos (clúster) para fomentar la diversidad del profesorado. El proceso implica reclutar grupos completos de profesores con diversas experiencias y trayectorias. Ortiz-Licon, investigadora de educación superior, argumenta que esta contratación “en comunidad” aumenta el sentido de pertenencia a sus respectivos campus y fortalece la retención de estos educadores a largo plazo.
 En otoño, Sacramento State implementó su primera contratación de personal en un grupo de estudiantes, dirigida directamente a apoyar a los estudiantes latinos . Ese semestre, el 37 % de los estudiantes eran latinos, mientras que el 10 % del profesorado lo era, según la base de datos de investigación institucional de la universidad.
 Rebecca Cameron, vicerrectora interina para el éxito del profesorado en Sacramento State, dijo que la universidad buscó profesores con experiencia en tutoría, enseñanza e investigación de poblaciones latinas.
 Si bien Sacramento State contrató a 10 profesores de varios departamentos, Cameron dijo que dos de los nuevos contratados para puestos de titularidad anteriormente ocupaban puestos de profesores en la universidad.
 Cameron enfatizó la necesidad de retener a los nuevos empleados del grupo ya que a veces ha observado que los profesores que son los primeros de un grupo particular en un departamento pueden agotarse.
 “También sigue siendo muy importante que no dejemos el trabajo de inclusión [exclusivamente] en manos de personas que han identificado un interés específico en él”, dijo Cameron.

(New Bedford Light photos)This story first appeared in The New Bedford Light. Read the original version here.
When the first turbine pieces for Vineyard Wind inched into port in 2023, cranes and union labor stood at the quayside of a nearby terminal, ready and waiting to get to work. In the more than two years since, the project has kept the state-owned New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal busy and funded through a multimillion dollar lease.
But the 26-acre site wasn’t always bustling.
Eight years before Vineyard Wind entered the scene, the state finished construction on the $113 million terminal, purpose-built to support offshore wind, a buzzy industry that hadn’t yet landed. The site expected to welcome Cape Wind as the first tenant around 2015, but the Nantucket Sound project fell through after opposition. The taxpayer-funded site remained underutilized for years, and was left to find new, and smaller, revenue streams.
Amid the Trump administration’s offshore wind crackdown, it will soon find itself in a similar predicament. As the final Vineyard Wind blades trickle out, two questions emerge: What now for the offshore wind terminal, and what now for New Bedford — a city that courted millions in investment and built out its port to support an industry that’s facing an existential threat?
In a best-case scenario, experts predict construction in Massachusetts will stall for the remaining years of the Trump administration. But the worst-case scenario: the uncertainty imposed by the Trump administration in these last 12 months may be too challenging for a future pro-wind administration to overcome, freezing development longer-term.
For those on the New Bedford waterfront, their concerns are tempered with optimism. It’s a long game, and they’ve begun laying the groundwork to pivot their businesses for a few years until the next wave comes.
Still, “if the president that follows [Trump] is as hostile as he is, then we may be looking at a much longer term problem,” said New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.
 What’s next at the Marine Commerce Terminal and Foss Terminal?

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, a quasi-state agency that owns and operates the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, is currently undertaking a $45-million expansion of the site to support the larger and heavier “next generation” turbine components. It includes the addition of a few acres.
As that work has been underway, the site has largely emptied out with 61 of Vineyard Wind’s 62 turbines now towering above the Atlantic. The project’s lease with the terminal expires in June.
Before President Donald Trump was re-elected, MassCEC expected some lull at the site before the next project, which is supposed to be SouthCoast Wind. But the lull has had two years added to it, while SouthCoast Wind finds itself under increasing threat.

Bruce Carlisle, MassCEC’s managing director of offshore wind, wouldn’t provide much detail on the agency’s plans for the intervening years at the New Bedford site, stating staff have started to “put out feelers with interested parties.”
But Mitchell wants to know.
“There is going to be an extended period between projects. [MassCEC has] to figure out how to manage the in-between,” he said. “What we don’t want to see there in the interim is scrap metal or … other bottom of the barrel materials.”
Before Vineyard Wind, the terminal hosted land-based wind turbines, offshore wind research and survey vessels, recycled steel, ferry parking, modular building components, shipping containers, and timber piles. The terminal’s revenue was also millions less before Vineyard Wind arrived.
Just a minute or two drive north of the terminal is another wind site, the New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal — a private investment that remains under construction.
More than four years ago, city and state officials gathered at the then-abandoned power station to announce the site would take on new life to support a new generation of energy: wind.
Since 2024, the terminal has berthed offshore wind support and research vessels for Vineyard Wind and other projects. But it has become a bellwether of the industry’s stalling.
The original deed required the site to commit to exclusive use for renewable energy projects. But in October, Foss and city officials amended their agreement so the site may support transportation projects and storage of breakbulk (cargo too big to fit into a container).
The new agreement also temporarily allows the Seastreak Ferry to dock at the Foss terminal while it’s displaced from the closure of the State Pier. It allows parking for ferry customers — activities that have not been part of the terminal’s mission.
“We see there will be a lull,” said Andrew Saunders, president of the Foss terminal. “We see we need to adapt to what the market is.” He stressed their preferred market is “always the offshore wind market.”
If the next generation of wind projects was moving forward now, Saunders said he’d be in front of the city’s planning board to secure approval to build the terminal’s third phase: two 30,000-square-foot warehouses for wind developers.
But without power purchase agreements between the developers and utilities, the money won’t flow.

Mitchell wants New Bedford to be competitive with ports not just outside Massachusetts, but in it. So despite the hits to the offshore wind industry, he sees a possible opportunity for New Bedford amid some of the federal actions.
He’s talking about the Salem terminal, a public-private partnership between MassCEC, the City of Salem and Crowley (a maritime logistics company) that’s been in development since 2022 to support what was then a steady pipeline of projects to be built off the commonwealth’s coast and the Gulf of Maine.

That pipeline has since frozen, and the proposed terminal — on the site of a former coal plant — had $34 million in federal funding terminated this summer. (That funding amounts to about 10% of the project’s budget, per the City of Salem.)
Carlisle said the federal backing was a “critical part” of the funding mix. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo in November said it alone is “not entirely fatal” to the project’s completion.
Mitchell asked whether it makes sense for the state to have two staging terminals, stating New Bedford’s will be available when the industry picks back up.
“It’s no secret we in New Bedford have long been concerned about the possibility of the proposed facility in Salem competing against New Bedford,” he said. “The state has to explain why it would, at this point in the game, allow that project to proceed, given there aren’t offshore wind projects that might use New Bedford for the foreseeable future.”
But MassCEC believes the future market — as well as plans for floating wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine — warrants a second marshaling site.
“We’re taking … the medium and the long view,” said Carlisle. “We are positioning ourselves for when this industry gets some traction again.”
Because the floating turbines in the Gulf of Maine will involve different technology, Carlisle said, the state needs a different port infrastructure to support it.
Pangallo, like Mitchell, is bullish on the industry’s long-term future — and his city playing a lead role in its buildout: “The horizon we see … is over decades, not just the next couple of years.”
Pangallo said the parties are exploring a phased buildout or possible redesign of the terminal to deal with the funding loss. He said they’re also exploring “other temporary alternative uses that could support the port’s operation in the interim.”
In other words, Salem’s future terminal is already facing a predicament similar to New Bedford’s after Cape Wind fell through.
Further complicating the terminal’s future plans: its anchor tenant, New England Wind, has been targeted by the Trump administration. The federal government has asked a court for the ability to reconsider its approval of the project’s construction plan —  a permit necessary for buildout.
MassCEC in 2024 said the Salem site was expected to be operational by 2026. Not much work has progressed beyond a symbolic groundbreaking in the summer of 2024. Carlisle said he could not comment on the expected commercial operation date.
“The actions by the Trump administration certainly have led to more uncertainty on the part of developers and their ability to commit to leases, and that has impacted the long-term revenue and financing visibility for Salem,” Carlisle said. “But we are actively working with Crowley and the City of Salem as we speak on plans.”
Yearslong pause ahead
In the short to medium term, there will be “quieter times” at the ports that support offshore wind, said Kris Ohleth, director at the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a Delaware-based nonprofit.
“I think market and investor confidence is pretty much as low as it can possibly be,” she said, saying developers are contemplating submitting permitting documents near the end of Trump’s term — three years away.
“I would venture that the ones that started construction last year have been living in a perpetual state of fear and potentially regret that they did start,” Ohleth continued. “I can’t imagine any developer risking capital investment in this environment.”
The developers’ fears are reasonable. Two have seen their projects paused twice, costing millions in losses per day. And in December, all five projects under construction along the Atlantic coast were suspended, with the federal government citing national security concerns.
Timothy Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, believes a longer term freeze is in the realm of possibility.
“The question is… will we see the industry ramp back up after Trump leaves office?” said Fox. “Our new best-case scenario for long-term offshore wind is that this is a pause. But we’re not convinced it is. We think the administration has sought to inject so much uncertainty into the industry that there’s not going to be a lot of interest among investors and financiers.”
Because the permitting timelines are lengthy and often span two presidencies, developers have experienced pendulum swings in the approaches of Democrat and Republican administrations. This last swing has been so extreme that it could have more lasting impacts, experts say.
 New Bedford jobs on ice

Though offshore wind is touted as a clean energy alternative, Mitchell sees the industry’s role and impact in New Bedford as an economic one. And with no project to follow once Vineyard Wind concludes its high-capital construction phase, that economic spout is expected to reduce to a trickle.
Mitchell said it concerns him, but he emphasized New Bedford never was, and never will be, a wind-only port.
“New Bedford is still primarily a fishing port. … That said, the recent contribution of marshaling of the Vineyard Wind project is a not insignificant contributor to the port’s total economic output,” he said. “It’s created jobs, opportunities for small businesses in the city.”

SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind, the two projects planned next for Massachusetts, face threats of having their federal permits and approvals revoked. They missed another deadline to secure power purchase agreements with the state utilities.
Each project promises about 100 jobs for the city, Mitchell previously estimated, including union labor.
Andy Benedetto, business representative at Local 1121, which includes carpenters and millwrights, said the union was in planning talks with SouthCoast Wind on what training and standards worked best.
But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.
“We invested millions into training people and building this workforce that now is just going to be more or less stagnant,” Benedetto said.
The National Offshore Wind Institute, a Bristol Community College site that opened in 2024 to train the union workforce and other industry members, is looking to pivot, like its waterfront neighbors.
Brianne McDonough, interim vice president for economic and business development at Bristol Community College, in an interview this fall said the school “designed the use of the building around wind,” but that it can train different industries, including oil, gas, and construction.
Some smaller-scale wind work may continue in the coming years out of New Bedford. That includes possible operations and maintenance work, and fishermen providing site and safety security for turbine installation or subsea cable laying.
Tony Alvernaz, a New Bedford scalloper, made it clear that he supports the Trump administration and opposes wind turbines being installed around fishing grounds. But, he’s also appreciative of the work he’s found with the industry.
Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project. His fishing boat will guard a bigger vessel as it lays cable. The job was set to start in February, but that’s unclear now that the project is suspended.
“I won’t say I’m grateful for [offshore wind],” Alvernaz said. “I’m grateful for the work I guess. Who knows where I would’ve been without this extra work.”
e’s glad to see a slowdown as it will allow research to catch up: “Now you get to see these guys fully permitted finish their projects… the pros and cons will come out in the next few years.”
Mitchell shared similar sentiments, saying the Trump administration’s revisiting and reconsideration of some lease siting with more weight given to fishing interests was necessary.
The speed at which the wind industry was taking off under the Biden administration, and even before, often sparked analogies about those involved building the ship as they’re sailing it. Now that it’s slowing — if not stopping — Ohleth offered a variation.
“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it. Now the plane is on the ground. That’s an opportunity,” she said. “Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.”
In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined. The foreign jack-up ships and retrofitted barges are in high demand and will return to Europe or the south to support other projects and industries.
But the local workforce, shoreside companies, terminals and smaller fishing boats that have built offshore wind into their business plans will need to pivot.
For how long remains an open question.

Kevin Stitt speaks in the school library of Eisenhower International School in Tulsa on Oct. 2. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Kevin Stitt is expected to advocate again this year for eliminating the cap on how much Oklahoma can spend to help children attend private schools, though the state hasn’t hit its current limit.
With the 2026 legislative session set to begin Feb. 2, Stitt remains committed to removing the $250 million spending cap on the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, his press secretary Tevis Hillis told Oklahoma Voice. The tax credits provide $5,000 to $7,500 to families to offset the cost of private school tuition and fees.
“Demand far exceeds current funding, leaving families on waitlists,” Hillis said. “His goal is simple: let more kids attend the school of their parents’ choice.”
However, the Oklahoma Tax Commission confirmed to Oklahoma Voice it hasn’t had to turn away any applicants this school year because of the budget limit. 
The Tax Commission reported last week that nearly $1 million in tax credits were still available for the 2025-26 school year with under two weeks left before the application window closes. Families have been able to apply since Feb. 18 of last year, according to the commission’s website.
When asked for clarification, Hillis said her reference to waitlists “pertains to students seeking those schooling options.”
The Oklahoma Legislature would have to agree to adjust the program’s spending cap, but lawmakers didn’t give even a committee hearing to a Senate bill last year that sought to remove the limit entirely. State officials estimated the policy would cost the state $13 million.
The state Senate’s top leader has continued to express reservations about uncapping the program.
“Any changes must be done responsibly,” Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said in a statement this week. “Removing the cap entirely at this time could lead to unintended consequences and strain the state’s ability to ensure the program is meeting its intended purpose. Our priority is making sure those who need help the most are the primary beneficiaries.”

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, didn’t return a request for comment.
The state is projected to have $692 million less to spend than the year before, raising doubts about the feasibility of major new investments.
Stitt first advocated for eliminating the maximum spending limit on the Parental Choice Tax Credits in his state budget proposal last year. In a recent guest column in The Oklahoman, the governor pledged he would work this year to make the tax credits available to more families.
So far, only one new bill has been filed that would expand the program. Senate Bill 1389 from Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, would allow the spending limit to increase by 20% if at least 90% of the available funds are claimed.
Daniels filed last year’s bill to completely remove the spending cap. She said her new legislation is a “much more fiscally conservative, responsible way to go.”
“My bill this year allows us to grow the program in a responsible, measured way because we now see that it is very successful, and more Oklahoma families are choosing to take advantage of it,” Daniels said. “We should allow that credit limit to increase gradually as participation increases.”

Stitt and Republican lawmakers have celebrated the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, created in 2023, as a way to help financially disadvantaged families leave public schools and access the private school of their choice. 
Legislative Democrats have long criticized the policy for giving funds to wealthy families and for diverting millions of dollars that they say should instead go to public schools, which educate the vast majority of Oklahoma students.
Last week’s report from the Tax Commission shows the state so far has spent $249 million this school year on tax credits for 39,485 students. Just over 3,700 of those students had attended a public school the semester before the 2025-26 academic year, according to the report.
Students who qualified for the $7,500 maximum tax credit made up the largest share, 28.4%, of awarded applicants, according to an Oklahoma Voice analysis. These are children from households that earn no more than $75,000 a year or receive income-based government benefits like SNAP and Medicaid.
The state spent $79.6 million on private school tax credits for these students. 
The second-most-awarded group of applications, 27.3%, came from families with a yearly income between $75,001 and $150,000. These households, which qualify for $7,000 per student, collectively received more than $72 million from the program.
Households earning over $250,000 a year were the third-most common, representing 24.5% of total recipients. Oklahoma spent $48 million this school year to support the private school costs of these families, who qualify for $5,000 per student.

First Lady Casey DeSantis said the state tested 24 infant formulas and found that 16 contained heavy metal or chemicals. The samples were obtained through a variety of means, including ordering online, to make sure that it was “not a one-off shipment.”
The state has placed the testing results on a website called exposingfoodtoxins.com and those results show that the heavy metals included mercury, arsenic, lead, and cadmium. The brands tested include several manufactured by national industry leaders.
Infant formulas are not regulated by the state, but Casey DeSantis said it is important Florida and other states do independent testing to “drive accountability.”
“Parents should not be expected to verify the integrity of products on their own,” she said.

The push by Florida to test infant formula comes several months after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the Food and Drug Administration to look at ingredients used in infant formula. Before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, Kennedy promised to look at whether there were toxic metals in infant formula.
The first lady discussed the infant formula testing during an event in Bartow that also featured Gov. Ron DeSantis and State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.
In his remarks, Ladapo contended the results produced an “understatement of the risk” because infants can be subject to greater harm given their size, weight, and developmental stage.
He added that, of the items tested, “mercury is probably one of the most toxic things you can put in a person’s body.”
Gov. DeSantis only briefly touched on the infant formula testing results, but called the effort part of Florida’s efforts to bring “transparency” to medicine and food. He did briefly repeat his support for a bill that would bar physicians from refusing to treat someone if that person has refused to get vaccinated.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/infant_john-moore_getty-images.jpg,,,2026-01-09 13:59:16.766680

Un juez de inmigración concedió la libertad bajo fianza a Idris Demirtas, pero eso no fue suficiente para reunirlo con su esposa en San Diego. 


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Un inmigrante turco que huyó de su país después de ser torturado ahora está en casa con su esposa en San Diego después de haber estado detenido durante aproximadamente siete semanas por las autoridades estadounidenses.
 Idris Demirtas , de 25 años, fue liberado solo después de que una jueza federal del Distrito Sur de California concediera un recurso de hábeas corpus, al determinar que su detención era injustificada. Una jueza de inmigración emitió un fallo a favor de Demirtas una semana antes, pero supeditó el fallo a un proceso judicial federal.
 Su arresto en un control migratorio rutinario y su detención durante 48 días reflejaron algunas de las tácticas de aplicación de la línea dura de la administración Trump desde que el republicano asumió el cargo hace un año y se comprometió a deportar a un millón de personas por año.
“Crecí mucho en este proceso, pero perdimos mucho emocional y mentalmente”, dijo Mae Bovenzi, la esposa de Demirtas. “Espero que nuestra salud mental se normalice. Siento que nos han desinformado mucho y he visto con mis propios ojos cómo nos están arrebatando los derechos constitucionales”.
La pareja, que se casó en mayo, se perdió su primera temporada navideña juntos debido a la terrible experiencia, pero ahora planean celebrar a su manera, dijo Bovenzi. Añadió que estaba agradecida por todo el apoyo que recibió su familia.
“Mi cuerpo no quería dormirse anoche porque tenía miedo de soñar que estaba de nuevo en la cárcel”, dijo Demirtas sobre su primera noche en casa tras siete semanas encarcelado.
 Demirtas fue arrestado el 20 de noviembre cuando cumplió con una orden de comparecer a un registro de rutina del ICE en San Diego en el tribunal federal Edward Schwartz del centro de la ciudad.
 Fue uno de los cientos de personas que fueron arrestadas en California el año pasado al comparecer en controles de inmigración o audiencias judiciales. Sus antecedentes habrían hecho improbable su detención durante el gobierno de Biden. Está casado con una ciudadana estadounidense y tiene una solicitud de residencia permanente pendiente. No tiene antecedentes penales, según confirmó un abogado del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional durante una audiencia de fianza la semana pasada. Proviene de un país con un historial de derechos humanos criticado por el Departamento de Estado y llegó a Estados Unidos tras huir de la persecución religiosa. Declaró en documentos judiciales que fue torturado en Turquía debido a sus creencias religiosas.
 A pesar de esos antecedentes y de que un juez de inmigración dictaminó que podría ser liberado bajo fianza el 30 de diciembre, Demirtas permaneció detenido en el Centro de Detención de Otay Mesa hasta que el juez de distrito concedió su petición de hábeas corpus y fue liberado el martes por la noche.
 Los abogados recurren cada vez más a los tribunales federales para conseguir la liberación de sus clientes debido a las interrupciones en el sistema judicial de inmigración. La administración Trump ha despedido a más de 100 jueces de inmigración en todo el país, según la Asociación Nacional de Jueces de Inmigración.
En California, más de una cuarta parte de los jueces federales de inmigración han sido despedidos, jubilados o renunciaron desde la toma de posesión de Trump en enero de 2025. En San Francisco, al menos 12 jueces de inmigración han sido despedidos o se han quedado sin explicaciones claras, lo que agrava un atraso de 100,000 casos en la región que cubre.
Un portavoz de la Oficina Ejecutiva de Revisión de Inmigración, que supervisa los tribunales, dijo que ese despacho no hace comentarios sobre asuntos de personal.
‘Sistema implacable’
 En julio de 2025, la administración Trump emitió una directiva que requería la detención obligatoria para casi todos los no ciudadanos que ingresaran a Estados Unidos sin autorización.
 “Dado lo implacable que es el sistema migratorio actual, hay personas importantes que simplemente se dan por vencidas”, dijo Matthew Holt, abogado de inmigración de Demirtas. “Es triste verlo después de los sacrificios generacionales que han hecho”.
 Holt y otros abogados han dicho que el nuevo sistema de detener a más personas y no dejarlas salir bajo fianza o libertad condicional es como una “guerra de desgaste”, una estrategia militar en la que un bando desgasta al otro agotando sus recursos y su moral.
 En septiembre, unos 7079 casos judiciales de inmigración en todo el país finalizaron con una salida voluntaria, que permite a una persona salir del país dentro de un plazo determinado y suele conllevar sanciones menores que una orden de deportación. Esta es la cifra más alta jamás registrada en un solo mes, según datos del Centro de Acceso a Registros Transaccionales de la Universidad de Syracuse, que contiene información sobre casos desde 1997. En California, el total fue de 408.
 “Personalmente, he visto a personas con argumentos válidos, o que podrían ser válidos, decir antes de la audiencia, antes de su testimonio: ‘Quiero una orden de deportación. Quiero irme. No puedo soportarlo más'”, dijo Jeremiah Johnson, ex juez de inmigración de San Francisco, quien fue despedido el 21 de noviembre por correo electrónico sin explicación. 
 Jueces federales fallan en contra de la detención
 Un portavoz del Departamento de Justicia declinó hacer comentarios. Anteriormente, la subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Tricia McLaughlin, había insistido en que Demirtas había entrado al país ilegalmente.
“Para ser claros, tener una solicitud pendiente con USCIS o la posibilidad de ser elegible para una tarjeta de residencia (green card)  no le otorga a nadie estatus legal”, dijo McLaughlin sobre el caso.
 Un documento presupuestario del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de 2024 dice que a ICE le cuesta en promedio $217 por día detener a alguien en San Diego, lo que significa que los contribuyentes estadounidenses pagaron alrededor de $10,416 para que Demirtas fuera detenido antes de que la agencia finalmente aceptara liberarlo.
 Antes del segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump, las demandas federales conocidas como “habeas corpus” no se utilizaban con regularidad en casos de inmigración. El “habeas corpus” es el derecho constitucional que garantiza que las personas tengan la oportunidad de impugnar su encarcelamiento ante un juez.
 En 2025, se presentaron cientos de casos de hábeas corpus en el Distrito Sur de California, y miles de ellos se presentaron para inmigrantes detenidos en todo el país. En lo que va de 2026, ya se han presentado alrededor de una docena de casos similares en el Distrito Sur de California, según habeasdockets.org , un sitio web que da seguimiento a este tipo de solicitudes.
 Los jueces federales han rechazado sistemáticamente la política de detención obligatoria de Trump. En una presentación reciente en el Distrito Sur de Nueva York , el juez federal de distrito Lewis A. Kaplan señaló que los extranjeros han ganado sus peticiones de hábeas corpus en 350 de 362 casos en tribunales federales de distrito. Escribió que “160 jueces diferentes, en aproximadamente 50 tribunales diferentes repartidos por todo Estados Unidos”, dictaron las sentencias. 
 Nuevas vacantes para ‘jueces de deportación’
 Los tribunales de inmigración operan bajo la jurisdicción del poder ejecutivo, no del poder judicial independiente que supervisa los tribunales federales. Los tribunales dependen del Departamento de Justicia, lo que otorga a la administración Trump mayor autoridad sobre los jueces de inmigración. A diferencia de los tribunales penales, no se asignan abogados a quienes no pueden costear una representación legal.
 El Departamento de Justicia comenzó recientemente a anunciar puestos vacantes para “jueces de deportación”, particularmente para empleados ubicados en San Francisco, Santa Ana, Sacramento y Los Ángeles, donde se invita a los solicitantes a “combatir el fraude y garantizar que aquellos que buscan explotar las vulnerabilidades de nuestro sistema de inmigración no tengan éxito”.
 Un portavoz del Departamento de Justicia dijo que el esfuerzo tenía como objetivo “restaurar la integridad de nuestro sistema de inmigración”.
 “Después de cuatro años de que la Administración Biden obligara a los tribunales de inmigración a implementar una amnistía de facto para cientos de miles de extranjeros, este Departamento de Justicia está restaurando la integridad de nuestro sistema de inmigración y alienta a los profesionales legales talentosos a unirse a nuestra misión de proteger la seguridad nacional y la seguridad pública”, escribió en una declaración enviada por correo electrónico.
 La administración Trump también ha asignado temporalmente a abogados militares para que actúen como jueces en casos de inmigración, lo que según algunos expertos podría violar el posse comitatus, la ley del siglo XIX que define lo que los militares pueden hacer en suelo estadounidense.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010525-Idris-Demirtas-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 13:12:18.794599

Duffy contends 54% of the state’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses reviewed by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration  (FMCSA) were issued illegally. (File photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The U.S. Department of Transportation is threatening to withhold nearly $50 million in federal funding from North Carolina if the state refuses to revoke commercial driver’s licenses the department contends were illegally issued to immigrant drivers.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy issued a statement Thursday contending 54% of the state’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses reviewed by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration  (FMCSA) were issued illegally.
Such licenses are intended to be issued to foreign nationals who are in the United States legally. Canadians and Mexicans may drive in the U.S. with their home country’s licenses for temporary visits.
“North Carolina’s failure to follow the rules isn’t just shameful – it’s dangerous,” Duffy said in a statement. “I’m calling on state leadership to immediately remove these dangerous drivers from our roads and clean up their system.”
Duffy’s statement comes amid an ongoing nationwide audit of states’ truck licensing systems by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
North Carolina must fix its licensing “failures” and “immediately revoke” all illegally issued licenses, federal officials said.
“The level of noncompliance in North Carolina is egregious,” said FMCSA Administrator Derek D. Barrs. “Under Secretary [Sean] Duffy, we will not hesitate to hold states accountable and protect the American people.”
In a letter to Gov. Josh Stein, Barrs said the illegal licenses were discovered during an annual program review of the state CDL program initiated by his administration last August.
Barrs said his administration found that the NC Department of Transportation, Division of Motor Vehicles issued:

Non-domiciled CDLs that extend beyond the expiration of drivers’ lawful presence in the United States.
Non-domiciled CDLs to citizens of Mexico not present in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Non-domiciled CDLs without providing evidence that it verified the driver’s lawful presence in the United States.

The DMV shared this statement when asked to comment on the letter:
“NCDMV is committed to upholding safety and integrity in our licensing processes,” the agency said. “We have been collaborating closely with our federal partners for several months to resolve these matters that are impacting many U.S. states.”
U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, posted on  X that the “North Carolina DMV has been a complete disaster, from long wait times to paperwork issues, and beyond” under the previous administration.
“I hope Governor Stein and the @NCDOT will quickly clean up this mess left to them by the previous administration and get North Carolina back into compliance as soon as possible,” Budd posted.
To avoid losing federal funding, Duffy said the North Carolina DMV must take the following corrective actions:

Immediately pause issuance of non-domiciled CDLs
Identify all unexpired non-domiciled CDLs that fail to comply with FMCSA regulations.
Revoke and reissue all noncompliant non-domiciled CDLs if they comply with the federal requirements.
Conduct a comprehensive internal audit to identify all procedural and programming errors, training and quality assurance problems, insufficient policies and practices, and other issues that have resulted in the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs that did not meet federal rules.

Each time they leave, the woman said, they risk arrest, detention and deportation. She asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by immigration enforcement agents. (Verite News previously interviewed the woman in August.) Her husband, a construction worker, stopped going to work entirely for the first few weeks of December, after the beginning of the U.S. Border Patrol surge in New Orleans.
Despite the risk, he has since returned to work, she said, because they need the money.
“He needs to go out and work, we have rent to pay,” she said in a message on WhatsApp in December.
“My husband works alone when he is sure that there is not much movement on the streets,” another message, sent in January, said.
The couple worry about what would happen to their child — a 4-year old U.S. citizen — if they do get picked up. So they devised a backup plan — a notarized letter that names a close friend they trust as a temporary guardian for their son, also called “provisional custody by mandate.” The letter, which was drafted in March, authorizes the friend to take the child to and from school, to take him to his medical appointments and, if necessary, to travel with him out of the country.
“Having this Plan B gives me peace of mind, knowing that no matter what happens my child will be protected and cared for,” the mother told Verite News. “This decision was made with my child’s safety and stability in mind.”
As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, a growing number of immigrant parents — even some with legal status in the U.S. — across the New Orleans metro region are making such provisions to protect their children’s well-being, immigrant rights groups told Verite News.
There is no publicly available data to show how many temporary guardianship arrangements have been created in Louisiana since Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration or since the “Catahoula Crunch” operation began in December because these mandates are private legal documents, not court orders. But representatives from local organizations that support Latino and immigrant communities, including Puentes New Orleans and Familias Unidas en Accion said they have seen a sharp increase in families requesting help with making provisional custody arrangements.
Leticia Casildo, executive director of Familias Unidas, said before 2025, her organization encouraged undocumented parents to create guardianship arrangements for their children should they ever be detained, but back then, the group had few takers.
“Maybe we would have 10 people sign up in one year,” Casildo said.
Last year, however, Casildo said more than 200 families requested help to arrange for temporary guardianship. Since Catahoula Crunch launched, Casildo said, Familias Unidas has been arranging for volunteer notaries to visit peoples’ homes to assist with getting these legal documents signed because many are afraid to leave their residences.
Suma Setty, a senior analyst of policies affecting immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy,  said her organization has received a “huge increase” in inquiries about temporary guardianship from local advocates and child care providers.
“The reason why these are becoming more popular is because parents are terrified” of what could happen if an arrangement is not in place, Setty told Verite News in a phone interview Thursday.
In April, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deported two mothers from Honduras, and their U.S. citizen children, after they were taken into custody at routine check-ins with operators of the agency’s immigrant surveillance program. A lawsuit filed in August on behalf of both families alleged that the mothers were not given the opportunity to arrange care for their U.S. citizen children, including one boy who was in treatment for stage 4 cancer.
In July, ICE issued a policy directive instructing officials to designate a “detained parent coordinator” and to “facilitate required participation in family court, child welfare, or guardianship proceedings, and communication with child welfare services” when parents or legal guardians of minors or incapacitated adult dependents are detained. ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.
The Center for Law and Social Policy interviewed undocumented immigrant parents in six states last year. Setty said the parents who already had agreements in place were people with large social networks that included adults with legal status in the U.S. who they trusted. She stressed the importance for advocates to connect immigrant parents who don’t have those networks with people who they can build trust with.
Although temporary guardianship agreements vary from state to state, Setty said they generally allow for another adult to make decisions about children’s education, medical care and sometimes finances, while they are separated from their parents.
“These agreements are critically important for immigrant parents to ensure the best possible care for their children,” Setty said.
Arthur Ago, director of strategic litigation and advocacy at the Southern Poverty Law Center, who focuses on education and youth policy, acknowledged that such arrangements are often the best way to guarantee a child’s security when a parent is taken into immigration custody, he wishes that parents were not being forced to make them. Sudden changes in a child’s family structure have long-lasting negative consequences, he said.
“You are going to end up with children that could potentially be socially isolated within that new guardian unit, let alone if they have to move school districts,” Ago said. “That isolation destroys any sense of security and hope for children. … And that is going to set them back years.”
Originally from Guatemala, Mayra, a New Orleans mother of three with work authorization in the U.S., said she worries about how the “persecution” of immigrants is affecting her three children. Her two daughters are glued to the social media accounts of local immigrants rights activists, watching to see where Border Patrol and ICE agents are showing up next. Whenever there are alerts that agents are in their community, her kids beg her not to go outside, she said. And when she goes to work as a cleaner, they inundate her with phone calls to make sure she’s safe and will return home.
“I think the fear that they feel is more than I feel,” Mayra, who asked Verite News to use her first name only because she fears being targeted by immigration enforcement, said in Spanish, speaking through an interpreter. “After all this [is over] I don’t think they’re gonna be the same.”
When the Border Patrol operation began in New Orleans Mayra sat her daughters — ages 10 and 13 — and her 18-year-old son down to tell them the plan she’d come up with if she were to be detained. The conversation was difficult, she said. When she told her son he’d have to sell her car to make sure they had enough money to get by without her, at least for a while, the children burst into tears.
But the first thing they’d have to do, she said, was call Elizabeth, a social worker they’d known since her youngest daughter was a baby. Elizabeth had agreed to take care of the kids if Mayra were to get picked up.
Mayra didn’t make a formal arrangement with Elizabeth. Since her eldest son is 18, he would be able to maintain legal guardianship of his younger siblings. And with his permission, Elizabeth, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, would do the actual work of taking care of them.
Mayra said she trusts Elizabeth — who has previously taken the children to Guatemala to visit their family members there — completely.
Mayra and Elizabeth have both spoken about preparing her children to be independent in case they’re separated from their mother.
“It’s out of necessity, they need to be able to survive without [her],” Elizabeth, who said she is honored that Mayra asked her to watch over her children, said. “[It’s] deeply sad for the orientation for your kids to have to shift in that way.”

Free.,"Thune, GOP senators at the border tout big hiring boost for immigration crackdown",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thune-gop-senators-border-tout-big-hiring-boost-immigration-crackdown,,"WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader John Thune, joined at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday by a handful of other Republican senators, highlighted the president’s signature tax cuts and spending package passed last year that provided billions for immigration enforcement.The press conference in McAllen, Texas, came after a federal immigration officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, and two people were shot by Border Patrol agents late Thursday in Portland, Oregon.Thune, a South Dakota Republican, touted how the tax cuts and spending package signed into law last summer also provided “for additional reinforcements,” such as the hiring of more Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, more than doubling its force from 10,000 agents to 22,000. Thousands more are set to be hired.The GOP-passed bill also included $4.1 billion for Customs and Border Protection to hire 5,000 customs officers and 3,000 Border Patrol agents over the next four years.Thune said because migration at the southern border has slowed, the time has come for President Donald Trump to shift his focus to immigration reform. CBP data from November, the most recent available, shows total apprehensions at the southwest border slowed to 7,350 that month.“I think President Trump is probably the president best equipped to lead the effort to reform immigration law in his country in a way that it creates, again, those better paying jobs, opportunities for people who come to the country legally,” Thune said. “We are a nation of immigrants, but we're also a nation of laws, and we have to make sure we're enforcing our laws, and that's where it starts.”The Trump administration has continued with its aggressive mass deportation efforts throughout the interior of the country and has moved to revoke the legal status of more than 1.5 million immigrants since taking office last January. Thune added that the GOP bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, also provided billions for border security.“As a result of the passage of the One Big, Beautiful bill … we got more resources down here, not only for physical infrastructure, for the wall, but for also that virtual infrastructure, for technology and counter drone technology, all those sorts of things that make it possible for the Border Patrol to do their job,” he said.Thune was joined by Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Ashley Moody of Florida, Jon Husted of Ohio, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.Rounds said that under the Trump administration the southern border has undergone “a remarkable transformation.” “There is no such thing as a country that can be a superpower, or, for that matter, be free if they can't defend their own borders,” Rounds said. Cornyn also highlighted how the bill will reimburse, up to $13.5 billion, those border states who have spent money on immigration enforcement. He said of that money, Texas will get $11 billion.",,,,2026-01-09 12:57:21.783382

National Popcorn Day is celebrated annnually on January 19th.
Some bucket list moments involve big trips or long-term goals, but others are delightfully simple. Going to the movies with a bucket of fresh popcorn definitely qualifies, and this National Popcorn Day, Penn Cinema is giving movie lovers a fun and flavorful way to check that moment off the list.
National Popcorn Day, celebrated annually on January 19, spotlights one of America’s most iconic movie snacks, with roots tracing back thousands of years to Indigenous cultures in the Southwest. From movie theaters to community events across Delaware, popcorn remains a simple, crunchy favorite; sometimes the best traditions come with a little butter and a lot of pop.
The Penn Cinema location on the Wilmington Riverfront is celebrating National Popcorn Day with a special bring your own bucket promotion. On January 18 and 19, moviegoers can bring their own bucket and have it filled with popcorn for just $5, adding a playful twist to a classic moviegoing tradition.
There are a few important guidelines guests should know before heading out. Buckets must be clean and watertight, and the maximum fill is limited to 400 ounces. The promotion is available while supplies last, so planning an earlier showtime may help ensure fans can take advantage of the deal.
The bucket fill turns an everyday snack into a shared experience and invites moviegoers to get a little creative. Some may bring a favorite reusable popcorn tub, while others might dust off a souvenir bucket from a past movie night. The rules are simple, and the fun comes from making the experience your own.
National Popcorn Day is also a reminder that bucket list moments do not have to be complicated. Catching a movie you have been meaning to see, sharing popcorn with friends or family, or carving out time to enjoy the big screen can be just as satisfying as checking off something much bigger.
Located along the Wilmington Riverfront, Penn Cinema makes it easy to turn a movie night into a full evening out. Many visitors pair a film with dining or a walk along the waterfront, while others make the theater the main destination. The Riverfront setting adds to the appeal, especially during the winter months when indoor entertainment takes center stage.
With a rotating lineup of current releases, Penn Cinema continues to offer audiences the opportunity to experience movies the way they were meant to be seen. Comfortable seating, large screens, and a shared audience all contribute to the magic that keeps people coming back to the theater.
As winter routines settle in and calendars fill up, National Popcorn Day offers a reason to slow down and enjoy something familiar. A movie ticket, a bucket of popcorn, and a couple of hours to escape into a story might be one of the easiest bucket list items to check off this year.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The state auditor called out a publicly-funded historical society in western Nebraska for potential misuse of a debit card, including the purchase of a pink oil burner from a Colorado vape shop.
A tip prompted the state probe of the Plains Historical Society in Kimball County, and results of that financial review led to a nine-page letter this week to the society and its board president, Jack Shaw.

Shaw’s daughter, Lisa, whom the audit team identified as a former board member of the historical society, was a target of the review. The state report alleges that Lisa Shaw persuaded the board to start using a debit card.
According to the state audit team, she made 54 purchases with the debit card during a roughly six-week period in 2024 totaling $1,386 for “apparently personal purposes.” The report itemized buys from places including a Kwik Stop, cafes, a Sugar Shack, diners, gas stations and a parking lot.
The audit team emphasized a $31 transaction at a vape and glass shop that included the pink-colored oil burner. A copy of a receipt and photos of the store were included in the report, along with a remark questioning “whether any of the products listed above could possibly be considered a reasonable or allowable expenditure of [historical] society funds.”
 Findings go to law enforcement

Debit card purchases were made from the historical society’s general fund bank account, which contains a mix of public and non-public funds. The audit team said the society did not appear to be accounting for the funds separately. 
Thus, it said, all the money should be considered restricted under state law to certain uses, such as construction of historical buildings, purchase of property of historical significance and related maintenance and storage.
State Auditor Mike Foley’s team called the situation concerning, regardless of whether reimbursement was made for “suspect charges.” The report noted that the board chairman, Jack Shaw, reimbursed the society in September 2024 for the questionable purchases. The debit card also was canceled.
The audit report said the society’s board is responsible for financial accountability and control over operations, including ensuring that public funds are spent according to state law. Foley’s office turned over its findings to the Nebraska Attorney General and Kimball County Attorney for review. 
The Shaws could not be reached for comment, but a board member, speaking on background, said he had discovered and reported potential misuse of the debit card to the local police department back in 2024. He said Jack Shaw reimbursed the society from his personal funds and that Lisa Shaw was voted off the board.
He said board members take the museum and preservation of history “very seriously and they want to keep it going.”

The audit report included a written response from Jack Shaw. He said the society’s governing board on Dec. 4, 2025, voted to reaffirm its decision to stop using a debit card and to open a separate account for non-restricted funds and to prohibit cash withdrawals except when specific requirements are met. He also included a letter to the entity’s bank laying out stricter procedures for cash withdrawals. 
Foley’s team noted in its report that debit cards do not provide as much fraud protection as credit cards and other more secure forms of payment and urged a more formal written policy outlining procedures for safeguarding public assets.
While Lisa Shaw is identified in the report as a former board member, Foley said she was an active member at the time of the questionable purchases. 
 ‘Get it right’ 

Listed as a public benefit nonprofit corporation established in 1957, the historical society owns and operates the Plains Historical Society Museum in Kimball. State law authorizes counties to grant such historical societies an annual amount of general tax funds for certain purposes, Foley’s office said.
With roughly 2,700 units of government under the watch of the state auditor, Foley said a little-known historical society ordinarily wouldn’t catch his attention. He said the tipster was helpful and that such examinations often have “a ripple effect” in sending a message for small and large governmental entities to be watchful.
“You’ve got to get it right,” he said. “It might be your time.”

(Photo courtesy of South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks)Custer State Park’s main highways and trails are open to visitors after last month’s high-speed winds swept through western South Dakota, but officials are warning visitors to stay aware of their surroundings.
Cleanup crews have been working to remove fallen trees and repair damages to park facilities, but there are still cracked trees that may be cause for concern, according to Matt Snyder, a parks regional supervisor for western South Dakota.
Though the park is open, Snyder is encouraging visitors to “be cognizant.”
“Be looking up ahead, up above you and see what’s going on. If you hear the winds blowing or something like that, I’d probably stay off the trails that day,” Snyder said. “But, if you do find yourself out there, just be looking above your head and see what’s going on, and just stay safe.”
Governor seeks federal help for damages from December wind storm

A western South Dakota windstorm last month damaged Custer State Park’s campgrounds, trees, park facilities and power systems.
Wind gusts were as high as 101 miles per hour between Dec. 17 and 18, according to the National Weather Service. The storm downed thousands of mature trees, tore through facilities and campgrounds and left Custer State Park without power for nearly a week.
The park lost one camping cabin to the storm, Snyder said, which is the most substantial damage. Other damage can be fixed.
“From a structural standpoint, everything’s going to be fine,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting the repairs done.”
Snyder said 65 workers from across state departments including Transportation, Wildland Fire and an inmate crew helped to cut through some of the fallen trees last week, especially those blocking roadways and hiking trails.
Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Wednesday he’s asked the federal government for help to repair public property across the region. Park leaders are still working through the Office of Emergency Management to determine the final cost of repairs at Custer State Park.
Park officials said lodges and cabins have been minimally impacted, without any serious impacts on guests. They plan to have damaged facilities open and ready for visitors again in April.

Jan. 9, 2026 | ScreenshotDetroit Mayor Mary Sheffield took a final victory lap on Friday with an investiture ceremony at the Detroit Opera House that, at times, felt more like church and a gospel concert than your average swearing-in for a government official.
Sheffield, the daughter and granddaughter of renowned pastors and civil rights leaders and an accomplished politician in her own right, gathered the city’s elected officials, several faith leaders and a large audience of friends and community members to extol her gratitude to the city for electing her in a November 2025 landslide.
“Throughout this journey, I didn’t always know every step ahead, but I trusted the calling, and I kept moving forward. And if this means anything, this moment today, I hope that it reminds every Detroiter of this truth,” Sheffield said. “That every single person gathered here today, every Detroiter across this city, has a purpose, has a unique gift, one that no one else can offer in quite the same way. And when we choose to walk in that purpose, when we choose faith over fear, courage over doubt, and we choose to say yes, even when the path is not always clear, extraordinary things can happen.”
Mary Sheffield makes history: Detroit elects first woman mayor

The event was headlined by Sheffield’s investiture but also featured a swearing in ceremony for newly elected or reelected members of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners, the Detroit City Council and Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey.
But it was certainly Sheffield who was in the spotlight, with poets, gospel singers, faith leaders and judges each offering their support, encouragement and blessings to the new mayor as she charts a path forward.
Sheffield thanked her family and close allies, as well as Mike Duggan, the city’s former mayor, for his role in helping the city progress. Now, it will be Sheffield’s job to keep that momentum and to help the city rise even higher, which is consequentially the slogan of her transition team as she gets settled.
“In this next chapter, we draw our strength from the prayers, the purpose and the power of generations who came before us; those who understood that improving the quality of life for all Detroiters is not the work of one leader but the responsibility of an entire city,” Sheffield said. “Here in Detroit, Dr. King first shared his dream, calling this city in this nation to become a beloved community. And that call is still relevant today, and it calls on all of us, not just those in elected office, but every resident, every community leader, every neighborhood, every institution that is gathered here today to do our part, Detroit, our futures are bound together.”
In another sign that it was a new day in Detroit’s history, Sheffield said that progress in her administration will be measured by who it helps along the way. In that vein, Sheffield said progress would be real only when it “reaches every block, every family, in every community in this city.”
“In this administration, every voice will guide our path, including voices that, for too often, have been overlooked. We will work every single day to build a Detroit that works for everyone,” Sheffield said, “by strengthening and investing in our neighborhoods, expanding access to programs and city services, and ensuring that every Detroiter truly feels the resurgence of our city.”
Sheffield said those goals will focus on safe and affordable housing, good-paying jobs that support families, reliable transit that connects Detroiters to opportunities and safety rooted in prevention and accountability so families feel safe in their neighborhoods and children are protected.
“We will value the hard work of labor, champion our legacy in our start up businesses and make Detroit the best place to start and grow a business,” Sheffield added. And lastly, we will empower and support our young people. That deserves a round of applause. I am energized by the generations of our youth that are rising across this city discovering their purpose right here at home, just as I did. We must continue to invest in their growth and build a Detroit where young people can dream without limits and see those dreams take shape right here at home.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-09 17:15:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Why is Simpson County’s chronic absenteeism rate so high? School district officials want to know how to help,Leonardo Bevilacqua and Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/simpson-county-seeks-truancy-fix/,Magee High School principal Duriel Banks walks through a neighborhood for an initiative that addresses truancy.,"PINOLA — Aaron Thompson drives his two elementary-aged children to school each day, but only when they aren’t sick or the road isn’t flooded. The family of four lives off a ragged stretch of concrete bounded on one side by a hunting trail and, on the other, by a worn bridge dotted with orange traffic cones.
Thompson admits that his kids are likely what the Mississippi Department of Education describes as “chronically absent,” a term for students who miss 18 or more days of instruction in a school year. Simpson County School District has the third-largest chronically absent population of any school district in the state, behind Moss Point School District and Claiborne County School District. 
The problem is statewide — chronic absenteeism rates in Mississippi surged from 13% in the 2017-18 academic year to 28% in 2024-25. But a closer look in Simpson County reveals a complicated story about student absenteeism.
Like most other counties where 75% or more of children require free and reduced lunch, almost half of students are considered chronically absent in Simpson County. The reasons vary by family, with explanations oftentimes exposing a fraying social safety net now relying on younger helpers around the house to take care of elderly relatives and toddlers and teenage laborers in town, who work to contribute to their household income. 
Aaron Thompson, a father in Simpson County, says he has replaced the front end of his car three times in the last four years because of wear and tear from driving on pockmarked roads.

Pinola, which lies in the southern half of Simpson County, is a community so rural that some of its roads don’t appear on Google Maps.
“Out here in the sticks it’s not so bad,” Thompson said. But he estimates that he has replaced the front end of his car three times in the last four years.
Chronic absenteeism is “a national problem,” Simpson County School District Superintendent Robert Sanders said. “I would like parents to know that we want to work alongside them to make sure their kids can learn.”
More than the robocall
Sanders took over Simpson County School District in July and was surprised to learn in October that his district had the third-highest rate of chronic absenteeism in the state. He gathered his principals and implored them to come up with an attendance strategy that would work for their students.

Magee High School Principal Jammal Banks, along with a school resource officer and the district communications professional, visited homes of students who hadn’t shown up for classes. Of Simpson County schools, Magee High had the highest rate of absenteeism at 67.2%. 
The group’s three door-knocking trips acted as a fact-finding mission and an opportunity for administrators to reach out in a friendly manner before truancy officers and the youth court got involved. Under the state’s compulsory attendance law, parents and guardians can be charged with contributing to the neglect of a child once a school attendance officer, or truancy officer, has made “all attempts to secure enrollment and/or attendance of a compulsory-school-age child and is unable to effect the enrollment and/or attendance.”
When a parent or guardian sees an administrator at their home about their child’s attendance, “they know we care about them and don’t just exist as a robocall,” Banks said. Some parents weren’t aware their child had missed so many days, he said.
In total, the Magee High group knocked on 17 doors. By the next week, 13 students had returned to class, though a handful reverted later to absenteeism. Banks said he regularly speaks to the truancy officer assigned to the local high school and middle school. The other one in the school district is based out of Mendenhall, where the bulk of the other schools are clustered.
The trio has taken three visits, speaking to at least five families on each one. They try to find solutions with parents and students, putting them in touch with the school counselor. Banks also put together an assembly called Commit to Graduation where students sign pledges to graduate on time.
Banks said students often express appreciation for the visits, saying, “I didn’t know you cared about me that much.”
‘There are a lot of us’
Teachers follow what educators call a pacing guide, which maps out the order in which instructors teach subject-specific skills and provides an outline for the curriculum.
Each day or week is dedicated to mastering a core competency or skill as it relates to literacy, math, science or social studies. When students stop showing up, especially those in need of additional support, the consequences can be hard to mitigate later on.
Christi Dampeer, a third grade teacher in Mendenhall, has noticed that nearly every student in her multi-tiered support system, or MTSS, group is chronically absent. MTSS is a program that helps academically struggling students stay on track to get promoted to the next grade level. Dampeer finds time to help chronically absent students catch up, but that can be difficult if students miss more than a handful of consecutive classes.
She has noticed that many parents allow their third graders to miss class, thinking the lower elementary math courses are far removed from important benchmarks. Damper said she often hears parents say those grade levels aren’t covering meaningful topics yet.
Some parents and community members also say engaging students in coursework will require active participation from families as well as school staff.

Thompson said his children were sick four times during the 2024-25 school  year, mostly with strep throat. He fears that policies pressuring sick students to attend class have contributed to their more frequent illnesses. He sometimes feels that an at home learning environment is more secure for his children, and has considered homeschooling.
Thompson subscribes to ABC Mouse, an educational video game, for the days that his second-grader and fourth-grader are unable to attend school.
Crystal Blair, who has two children enrolled in Mendenhall schools, said she has been more involved in their schoolwork because she also recently enrolled as a student. She is finishing an undergraduate degree. Unlike some parent friends of hers, Blair has been able to do algebra homework with her daughter. 
“I would like to see more parents help out,” Blair said. “But a lot don’t have the same help at home. Some don’t have W-Ffi.”
Dampeer also noticed that students’ needs aren’t always being met outside of the classroom, which affects their academic performance. She teaches students who regularly miss class for doctors’ appointments and out-of-school counseling. Some parents, Dampeer said, do not push their children to show up to class.
School Counselor Baritt Blount stocks a closet full of clean clothes and teaches students about proper hygiene. She regularly meets students from homes without running water and where parental supervision is slim. The school also has showers and hygiene kits available to those students, she said. 
Blount also tracks those students’ absences. Sometimes, she also visits students at home to talk to a parent or guardian.
“Ever since the pandemic, we’ve been fighting the battle on the flip side,” she said. “Kids are still struggling to get back into familiar routines.”
For one part-time cafeteria employee and grandmother, chronic absenteeism was difficult to avoid because of absent parents. She asked to not share her name out of fear of retaliation at work and from relatives.
The grandmother didn’t expect to be helping raise three grandchildren after rearing four of her own. She ensures they attend school regularly, which wasn’t a priority when their mother was raising them alone.
“You go to Walmart, there are a lot of us,” she said of her new guardian role. “Babies are having babies. Parents aren’t mature enough to take care of their own kids.”
Before her grandchildren and their 26-year-old mother moved in with her, she estimates that the children missed most of the school days the week prior. The grandmother said she was never able to get an adequate answer from her daughter about why they did not attend.
The high school job
Pamela Hobbs teaches mostly seniors in a college and career readiness class at Mendenhall High School. She said she believes the absenteeism resulted from unclear expectations for graduating seniors who had completed most diploma requirements. She has also seen a lot of her students “thrust into adult roles.”
“You still have to do your resume, anything can happen, and you never know,” Hobbs tells her students, even those who have secured local jobs before graduating.

To help prepare for a postsecondary world, Hobbs’ students complete in-class resume writing workshops and other workforce development instruction.
“Those students who are chronically absent are making their own choices, and not like when I was a senior,” she said. “Young people want to be held accountable and want to be responsible.”
Few jobs are open to high schoolers in Pinola. Kiana Russell, a manager at the local Dollar General, began to interview more high schoolers in 2023, after the store changed its policy to allow 16- year-olds to work there.
“You can tell the ones who really need it,” Russell said of part-time work. “It’s a good job for them because they get to see their friends in town and help out around the store.”
School staff have talked with local employers to ensure teenage workers aren’t working late on weeknights. 
Absenteeism for Mississippi high school seniors rose 9% over the past two years. Many seniors who have fulfilled their graduation requirements leave school during the third period for jobs. Some also participate in a late entry program, whereby students who work late hours can have no first period classes. 
Many students’ unexcused absences occur around holidays, on rainy days or when they’re exempt from exams.
Those practices shocked Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who conveyed his disappointment to education officials at an October state Senate committee meeting. 
Officials seem to be “signaling to students it’s not really important to come to school,” he said. “We’re shifting from the concept of, there’s an infinite number of things to learn … to something that is so focused on the requirements and testing.”
‘We can’t teach empty seats’
By 3 p.m. on school days, Mendenhall’s teen workforce trades their book bags for aprons. They bag groceries, scan items at the cash register and prepare food at a drive-through. Grocers, fast food joints and hardware stores employ them. Many chronically absent students fall into this category of holding part-time jobs, according to districtwide data. Their jobs often become a priority over their classes.
Mendenhall, the Simpson County seat and second largest city, is about 40 miles southeast from Jackson. Its downtown is dwarfed by a towering courthouse with a dark green dome. Popular area businesses include the Broadhead Do It Center hardware store, Vowell’s Marketplace grocery store and Ward’s, a fast food restaurant. The city’s population is 2,199 people, 28.9% of whom live in poverty.

For many Simpson County residents, a high school job is more than a rite of passage. As one grocery store manager put it, it’s how many high schoolers save enough money for college. 
Blount, the Magee Middle School counselor, still recalls the summer she clerked at her mother’s medical clinic, the afternoons and evenings helping out at a local eye doctor, and when she made sandwiches at a Subway. Afterschool jobs were a key part of her high school years along with algebra and extracurriculars.
Growing up in Magee, Blount said, her parents regularly told her that “school comes first.” Now she echoes that idea for some of her students and their parents. She said she sees her role as a counselor as “bringing the community together” and convincing parents and students of the value of an education. She doesn’t want a job or caretaker role to derail a student’s future.
“We can ensure every kid can come to school, be focused, be ready, be confident in their needs,” Blount said.
Sanders, the Simpson County superintendent, said it’s a priority to incorporate the feedback of high school educators and experts into attendance plans. He offers incentives such as  popsicle parties and other events for students with perfect and nearly perfect attendance records. He has encouraged teachers and principals to pioneer new classroom activities that make use of technology or software like Kahoot, an online learning game. 
“We are trying to create an environment where students want to come,” Sanders said. “We can’t teach empty seats. If there are barriers, share that with us.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31110819/Truancy10_Submitted-Photo.jpg,,,2026-01-09 12:57:21.783382

Bush, ordered Thursday that the university […]","Ramsi Woodcock has been reassigned from teaching and banned from entering the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he is an assistant professor.A federal judge denied a request from a University of Kentucky law professor to allow him to return to the classroom and end an investigation into his criticism of Israel and support of Palestine. 
U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, ordered Thursday that the university may continue its investigation into alleged conduct by Professor Ramsi Woodcock. The judge requested to be apprised of the results to make future rulings in the case. 
Reeves’ 41-page order showed that he remained largely unconvinced by Woodcock’s attorneys’ allegations of bias in the university’s actions. 
“While Woodcock may fear a nefarious intent behind the University’s investigation, he has not cleared the bar of demonstrating that the investigation was taken to harass or in bad faith,” Reeves wrote. “Instead, the University’s investigation was triggered by external complaints.” 
Woodcock filed the lawsuit in November seeking to be returned to his duties as a full-time tenured professor. His suit also seeks to block UK from using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in disciplinary proceedings.
“This case is about university officials torching the First Amendment and the university’s own regulations in an effort to protect a colonization project that practices apartheid and commits genocide,” Woodcock said in a statement to the Lantern Friday. 
“There is strong precedent stretching back to the Civil War that federal courts must intervene when rogue state actors, like the university officials in my case, abuse their authority to try to silence speech that they happen to dislike. I am confident that, with the aid of advice from an appellate panel, the court will act to reinstate me to teaching, and that could potentially happen during the coming semester.”
Jay Blanton, a spokesperson for the university, told the Lantern in a statement that UK “appreciates the Court’s thoughtful and clear ruling in this matter.” 
“The review of Professor Woodcock’s conduct is ongoing, and we will provide updates as the court has asked for in its ruling,” Blanton added. 
Woodcock and UK officials testified in federal court last month. During the hours-long proceeding, Woodcock disputed allegations against him, saying the university misrepresented actions that were part of an academic’s life, such as engaging in scholarly debate. He said his comments on Palestine and Israel were rooted in months-long academic research.
In letters to Woodcock, UK cited four professors who had heard him speak at academic conferences or read his comments on Listservs. They told UK that Woodcock spoke about genocide in Gaza at an academic conference and during another university’s panel discussion and had “spammed” Listservs with personal viewpoints on Palestine and Israel. UK later said four students “some of whom are Jewish” had said Woodcock spoke about the topic in an optional lecture and had shouted “Free Palestine” while in a car with UK law students.
Woodcock’s complaint said he does not talk about his conclusions regarding Palestine and Israel “in his classes because he did not want to cause students to face persecution for speaking about Palestine.”
Woodcock’s attorneys have raised concerns about the ability of Farnaz Farkish Thompson, a partner of McGuire Woods based in Richmond, Virginia, hired by the university, to be an unbiased investigator in the matter. In a letter to her, they said she was listed as a contributor to Project 2025, which was created as a guiding document for the Trump administration leading up to the 2024 presidential election. The document calls for U.S. support of Israel.
Among his various conclusions, Reeves wrote: “It should come as no surprise that the University would seek out an investigator with background knowledge on Israel and Palestine relations due to the nature of the speech at issue. That hiring choice does not breach the threshold for bad faith or harassment.” 
Reeves also said Woodcock’s attorneys failed to show that UK President Eli Capilouto would be “a biased adjudicator” in determining disciplinary proceedings into the professor’s conduct. Capilouto shared a public message in July that did not name Woodcock directly, but indicated the university was aware of his online petition calling for military action against Israel and called his views “if accurately attributed … repugnant.”
Woodcock received notice of the university’s investigation days later. 
Reeves said that UK “must be allowed to distance itself from any ideology or speech that threatens its efficient operations or undermines its mission or ethos.” 
Woodcock has continued to remain “a tenured faculty member with full pay and benefits from the University” while he has not been allowed to teach or enter the College of Law building, Reeves wrote. The judge said that “does not generally threaten irreparable harm.” Woodcock had testified that by not having access to the law building, he could not continue attending faculty meetings or use the law library for research. 
Woodcock may amend his complaint after “the investigation is completed or any subsequent disciplinary procedures have concluded and claims have been exhausted,” Reeves said. 
Both sides are to give status reports every 30 days to Reeves about the status of the investigation and other future proceedings.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-22-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-09 12:12:36.638771

Eric Chung announced Tuesday that his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District has raised over $1,125,000 million, including more than $255,000 raised in the 4th Quarter of 2025.
Former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam’s campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 7th District announced Tuesday that it raised more than $1 million in 2025, including $400,000 in 2025’s 4th Quarter. Maasdam also announced the endorsement of grassroots organizer Susan Anderson, a founder of the Blue Brigade.
Also seeking the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 7th Congressional District is former Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who said her campaign had raised more than $530,000 in the final quarter of 2025, combining for a total of $1.6 million.
State Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 4th Congressional District, said on Thursday his campaign has raised over half a million dollars in 2025, including more than $250,000 from 2,000 individual donors in the 4th Quarter.
Suzanna Shkreli, a Democratic latecomer to the race for Michigan’s Secretary of State, said her campaign has raised another $100,000 in the final weeks of December, with a total of over $300,000 raised since joining the race in early December.
 
 Endorsements

Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum’s campaign for the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s Secretary of State announced Thursday additional endorsements from more than a dozen current and former elected officials, including former U.S. Reps. Jim Barcia (D-Bay City), Mark Schauer (D-Battle Creek) and Joe Schwarz (R-Battle Creek), as well as UA 671 Plumbers, Pipefitters, HVAC & Welders, the Greater Lansing Labor Council and the Progressive Democratic Women’s Caucus of Muskegon.
State Sen. Roger Victory (R-Hudsonville) announced Wednesday that he is seeking to run as Republican for the Michigan State University Board of Trustees. Victory, who is term-limited, was quickly endorsed by the Michigan Agri-Business Association PAC.
On Thursday, the Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union announced its endorsement of Tim Greimel in his bid to secure the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.
 
 Announcements

Former Washtenaw County assistant prosecutor Christina Hines said Friday she had submitted 2,000 signatures to get on the ballot in her bid to win the Democratic nomination to represent Michigan’s 10th Congressional District, “the first candidate in the field to complete Michigan’s required signature collection process for the August and November ballots.”

The sites, which were awarded to the Oklahoma tribe and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, are the first two testing grounds for drones and other unmanned aircraft created in nearly a decade, according to the FAA.
In a statement Friday, James Grimsley, the Choctaw Nation’s executive director of Advanced Technology Initiatives, said the “designation is a meaningful step” for both the tribe and the future of aviation in Oklahoma.
The test site program is designed to evaluate the safety, operations and navigation systems of public and civil drone technologies prior to their use in national airspace, he said.
The Choctaw Nation said that the designation “comes at a critical time” as the FAA moves to create new rules that allows drones to be flown beyond line of sight, or where operators can’t see them, which will expand their commercial and public safety uses.
“Drone technology is already changing how services are delivered and how critical infrastructure is inspected, monitored and protected,” Grimsley said. “The next chapter is about proving what works safely at scale, and our role as a test site is to generate the data, operational insights and best practices that help make that possible.” 
In a separate statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new test sites will help gather critical data so “we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”
The FAA said Duffy unveiled a proposed Beyond Visual Line of Sight rule to expand drone usage in August.
“From delivering lifesaving medicine to surveying pipelines, drones are already reshaping industries and changing how people and products interact,” Duffy said in a statement. “It’s our job to make sure the United States safely leads the way with this exciting technology – not China. We’ve added these new test sites to help us gather critical data and test new systems so we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”

Plan selections and premium payments weren’t processed for some people who purchased coverage from ConnectiCare on the state exchange, Access Health CT CEO James Michel said.
“Access Health CT is notifying all impacted consumers. People may contact ConnectiCare directly for information regarding billing issues,” Michel stated.
Officials haven’t yet been able to confirm how many people were impacted. Michel estimated that it’s no more than 1,000. 
Ben Jackey, a ConnectiCare spokesperson, did not address a question from the Connecticut Mirror about how many people were impacted, but said the issue stemmed from a “system conversion” on Jan. 1.
“We are working diligently to rectify any related issues temporarily impacting members. ConnectiCare is committed to providing high-quality health plans and service and we encourage members to contact us with any questions,” Jackey stated in emailed comments.
The Connecticut Department of Insurance had only “just begun” hearing of the issues on Wednesday, the agency’s assistant deputy commissioner Gerard O’Sullivan stated in emailed comments.
“We are working with ConnectiCare and Access Health CT to determine the scope of the problem and expect to have more information in the next few days. Any consumer who is experiencing issues is encouraged to contact the Connecticut Insurance Department so we can review and intervene on individual cases,” O’Sullivan said.
While current estimates suggest the impact is relatively contained, reports of the glitches come at a hectic time for ACA plan enrollees. There are just three weeks remaining in Connecticut’s open enrollment period, and some residents are reassessing what coverage they can afford following the Dec. 31 expiration of some federal financial assistance for subsidies.
On Feb. 1, 2025, ConnectiCare was acquired by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that has members in 22 states. 
Connecticut residents have been complaining online about processing issues, website issues and customer service delays since the Jan. 1 conversion. Several pointed out that “Connecticut” wasn’t even an option in the state dropdown menu on Molina’s website.
Molina is one of two companies that offers individual medical plans on Connecticut’s health exchange, in addition to Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. 
In 2025, Molina-owned companies, which included ConnectiCare Insurance Company and ConnectiCare Benefits, covered nearly half of the more than 150,000 residents enrolled in a state exchange plan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP105258032254-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-09 11:59:39.628927

The person stayed  at the Hyatt Place in Hamburg from December 31, 2025 – January 2, 2026, the health department announced on social media. 
“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious health complications, especially in young children. Vaccination is the best protection against measles,” the health department said. “If you have concerns about exposure to measles, contact your health care provider.” 
According to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, there were 13 cases of measles in Kentucky last year. 
Kentucky health officials recently announced another potential exposure from an unvaccinated traveler who visited the Ark Encounter in Williamstown on Dec. 29 and stayed at the Holiday Inn & Suites in Dry Ridge Dec. 28-30.
Measles is extremely contagious and spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old.

Vaccinations have fallen and measles cases nationwide increased, with 2025 bringing the highest number of reported cases since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Connecticut reported one case, and the state had the highest MMR, or measles, mumps and rubella, vaccination rates in the nation among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year.
In Connecticut, 98.2% of kindergarteners received their MMR vaccine, according to CDC data. Herd immunity, a form of indirect protection against the spread of communicable disease, is met when 95% or more of a population is vaccinated. Only nine other states reached herd immunity for the MMR vaccine in the 2024-2025 school year.
Overall vaccination rates for Connecticut children have increased since 2020 after they fell during pandemic. According to a Washington Post analysis, the only other states to see this increase were Maine and Alabama.
Connecticut only allows for medical exemptions to vaccinations for school-age children after eliminating religious exemptions in 2021. The state does not allow personal exemptions. But even with these laws, some schools did not meet the 95% threshold for herd immunity.
However, many towns in the state met herd immunity for last year’s kindergarten classes. Some have very high levels of vaccination — over 98%.
While the state has high levels of childhood vaccination, seasonal vaccination rates are not as high. This flu season, according to state data as of Dec. 2, the flu vaccination rate was down 6% compared to the same time last year. There has also been an increase in flu cases and hospitalizations, and cases are far higher this year than they were the same time last year.
This overload of flu cases came just before this week’s announcement from the Trump administration overhauling the childhood vaccination schedule.

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past several weeks, including offenses related to long-expired food, unlicensed operators and dirty kitchens.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level.
Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between Nov. 13, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2025. (Last year, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure all food-safety inspection reports for eight days past the date of inspection.)
The inspections department reminds the public that its reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
Big R’s Bar & Grill, 103 Main St., Elberon — During a Dec. 31 visit, a state inspector cited this Tama County establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Violations included failure to ensure that all food came from approved sources as evidenced by “venison peppersticks” that were labeled “not for sale” and were stored in a chest freezer alongside other food items. The restaurant was also cited for home-canned vegetables that were stored on kitchen shelves alongside food used to serve patrons.
“Cooking pots and pans on the stove were not clean and have not been used since yesterday,” the inspector noted. “Onion slicer and potato dicer have dried food debris and buildup (although) the person in charge states they have not been used for several days.”
In addition, the flat-top grill and the flame grill each had a “large buildup” of an unspecified nature, and the kitchen sink designated for handwashing was blocked with several dirty dishes and was not accessible for handwashing. Also, household pest-control chemicals were stored in areas where food and clean equipment were being stored, an open package of rodent bait was found in the kitchen, and the food-preparation table and breading station were soiled.
“Floors are not kept clean in the kitchen and dry storage rooms,” the inspector reported. “Living quarters within the facility were open to the restaurant during the inspection.”
State records show the restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in April 2021.
Wilbo Burgers Brats & Beers, 118 Main St., Cedar Falls — During a Dec. 29 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this restaurant for employees failing to wash their hands, storing food-to-go containers on the floor of the basement under a set of water pipes, for an unspecified “buildup” of some kind within the ice machine, and for green peppers and house-made barbecue sauce that had been held longer than the maximum of seven days. Also, there was no detectable level of sanitizing solution used at the wait station, and the hot water supplied to the handwashing sink had been shut off due to a slow leak.
Eddie’s Tavern, 407 D St., Sergeant Bluff — During a Dec. 23 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector found bags of shredded lettuce and tomatoes that had a discard date of Dec. 13, 2025. Also, the interior of the ice machine was visibly soiled with “debris buildup” and the kitchen wall behind and alongside the griddle was melting, with the wall covering “breaking off.”
Nara Thai, 1725 Blairs Ferry Road, Marion — During a Dec. 23 visit, a Linn County inspector noted that salmon and shrimp were stored in the same tray as cucumbers and mixed peppers inside the refrigerator – a repeat violation. Also, five bars of cream cheese were sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 66 degrees before the staff agreed to discard them. In addition, there was a container of Thai soup that was not date-marked as to when it was either prepared or needed to be discarded – a repeat violation. In addition, the handwashing station in the kitchen was not supplied with soap, and employees’ personal food was stored in the refrigerator and freezer alongside food to be served to patrons.
Fareway, 115 1st Ave., Sioux Center — During a Dec. 22 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector noted that the meat department staff was not following proper handwashing protocols while packaging food for customers. Also, deviled eggs and cut pineapple were still in the display case and being offered for sale after their discard date.
The Other Place, 2010 SE Delaware, Ankeny — During a Dec. 22 visit, a state inspector found taco meat that had been holding in the walk-in cooler for two hours and had yet to drop below 85 degrees. The taco meat was then discarded. The inspector also noted that preparation and discard times on pizza slices were not being documented or monitored. The pizza slices were discarded.
In addition, there was no soap at the handwashing sink, and the inspector discussed with management the fact that cooked taco meat, chicken wings and grinder meat were all being cooled in large plastic tubs, which inhibited their ability to cool rapidly once placed in the cooler.
Subway, 1864 Highway 141, Sloan — During a Dec. 22 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector noted that the food protection manager’s certification had expired in July 2025 and that “lunch meats such as turkey and chicken,” were holding at 47 degrees, too warm to ensure their safety, and had to be discarded. The cooler was taken out of service and plans were made to have it repaired so it would keep food at 41 degrees or colder. The restaurant was last inspected in June 2022, according to state records.
Good Eatin’s, 5418 Douglas Ave., Des Moines — During a Dec. 18 visit, a state inspector noted that the person in charge was unable to demonstrate proper sanitizing procedures and was not a certified food protection manager. Also, the staff was not ensuring “the proper temperatures of food received,” the inspector reported.
“Cheese observed … damaged or discolored inside clear sealed packaging,” the inspector reported, adding that the cheese in question had to be discarded, and that “soft cheese” was being stored in what the inspector called a “non-operational walk-in room.”
La Finca, 916 W. 2nd St., Davenport — During a Dec. 18 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that three pots of cooked beef were holding at 107 degrees and were being cooled down at room temperature, outside of a refrigerator.  The beef was then placed in pans and moved to a freezer. The inspector’s report also made note of an unspecified issue involving “bison,” adding that unspecified food items inside one of the coolers were being held at 51 to 54 degrees and had to be discarded.
The inspector also reported, without explaining, that cut limes and salsa were “over stocked” and were holding at 51 degrees and had to be moved to another cooler. “Several food items in coolers not date-marked,” the inspector reported. “Tamales and other food items not covered in walk-in freezer and the chest freezer… Walk-in freezer floor has excess food debris on it.”










Mouse-like droppings were observed along the interior cabinets of the fryers ... Boxes containing cans of olives and pudding were observed being stored on the floor in the kitchen.


– Inspector's report on Rudy's Tacos in Bettendorf


Rudy’s Tacos, 3111 Devil’s Glen Road, Bettendorf – During a Dec. 18 visit, a Scott County inspector reported that a container of cooked ground beef was holding on the lunch buffet line at 120 to 122 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safety. Because the beef had been on the buffet line for less than two hours at that point, it was reheated to 165 degrees and then returned to the buffet line.  Also, one pan of cooked ground beef was observed sitting out, unattended, on a food-preparation table and was measured at 45 degrees. The beef was returned to a cooler for holding until it was ready to be put to use.
Also, the interior of one cooler had a pool of “dark colored substance and food residue” covering the bottom; the interior drawer of the food-preparation table was marred by a buildup of crumbs, dried food debris, and grease; the interior of the ice machine had a “small accumulation of soil;” and a can of Hot Shot Flying Insect Killer, not approved for use in a commercial kitchen, was stored in the kitchen.
“Mouse-like droppings were observed along the interior cabinets of the fryers,” the inspector reported. “Boxes containing cans of olives and pudding were observed being stored on the floor in the kitchen.”
Fuse, 224 2nd Ave. NE, Dyersville — During a Dec. 17 visit, a state inspector noted that a cold-holding unit used to keep food chilled was unplugged and was storing food at 60 degrees — well above the 41-degree maximum. All of the food stored in the unit was then discarded. In addition, the house-made barbecue sauce, pasta sauce, and soup were not marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety; the house-made Caesar dressing was made with unpasteurized eggs and had to be discarded; the dishwashing machine used to sanitize dishes was reaching a temperature of only 132 degrees, and the interior of the ice machine “appeared unclean,” the inspector reported.
Izumi Japanese Steak House, 4901 Utica Ridge Road, Davenport — During a Dec. 17 visit, a Scott County inspector found that lemon juice that required refrigeration was being stored at room temperature and a bottle of liquor “had fruit flies floating in the bottle.”
Also, cooked rice stored in large containers inside the walk-in cooler was measured at 53 to 57 degrees and had to be discarded; the ice machine and fountain-drink machine each contained “debris and gunk,” and access to a kitchen handwashing sink was blocked by equipment. The walk-in cooler door, door seal, and cooler fans contained “debris and gunk,” and the hot-water handle on the kitchen handwashing sink was broken off.
Maid Rite Diner, 3708 N. Division St., Davenport — During a Dec. 17 visit, a state inspector found that a food-preparation cooler was holding items at 51 to 52 degrees, which was too warm to ensure safety. “This is a repeat violation and requires long-term corrective action,” the inspector noted. Also, there was chili that was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and several items that were pulled from the freezer did not have the proper date markings.
In addition, “several items throughout the facility” had been held past the maximum of seven days, such as tomatoes dated Dec. 9, house-made ranch dressing dated Dec. 10, and queso dated Nov. 22.  Also, a box of dinner napkins was “stored on the ground in the back storage room near the restrooms” and the fryers had an excess buildup of grease inside them and on their tops.
Tony Roma’s, 350 Bell St., Dubuque — During a Dec. 17 visit, a city inspector made note of cheese that was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, tomato pasta that had a “use by” date of Dec. 14, cooked pork butt that had a “use by” date of Dec. 16, chipotle garlic butter that had a “use by” date of Dec. 16, and maple butter that had a “use by” date of Dec. 5. All of the outdated food items were then discarded.
In addition, racks inside one of the coolers were unclean and rusty, and the microwave ovens were visibly soiled. The visit was part of a preopening inspection triggered by a change in ownership.
“License not approved,” the inspector reported. As of Jan. 8, 2026, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing had yet to post any information indicating a follow-up inspection had been performed.
Mojitos Bar and Grill, 3303 S. Center St., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 16 visit, a state inspector found that gelatin desserts had been prepared in a private home and had to be removed from the food service. Also, two pans of carnitas did not have date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and several items had been held past the maximum of seven days, including beans dated Dec. 8, chicken dated Dec. 4, ground beef dated Dec. 6, and salsa dated Nov. 30. Also, cut tomato, cooked shrimp, and octopus had no date markings.
Mandarin Café, 1117 2nd St., Perry — During a Dec. 15 visit, a state inspector noted there was no certified food protection manager on staff, and the restaurant had eggs that did not come from an approved source and had to be removed from the kitchen. Also, chicken was being stored on a food-preparation table without any temperature control, and several foods previously cooked and cooled had no dates of preparation on them. “Some foods discarded during inspection,” the inspector reported, adding that carrots and cabbage inside a mesh bag were being stored “on the ground” and several food items were stored without lids or other coverings to prevent contamination.
Haley’s Deli Barbecue and Catering, 501 N. 3rd Ave., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 15 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 13-risk factor violations, an exceptionally high number.
Among the issues: The person in charge was not a certified food protection manager, and several food items — including chicken and noodles, mashed potatoes, meatloaf, gravy, corn, green beans, smoked chicken pieces, rice, and various cooked meats — were not held at safe temperatures and had to be discarded. Also, the restaurant had no consistent date-marking system in place to ensure food items were fresh and safe to eat.
Included among the foods that were date-marked, but past their expiration, were baked beans dated Dec. 7, pasta salad dated Dec. 6, macaroni salad dated Dec. 5, and broccoli salad dated Nov. 27, all of which had to be discarded.
In addition, equipment and utensils that were washed in the kitchen’s three compartment sink and mechanical dishwasher were not being sanitized, and although the business had a full-service alcohol bar, it lacked the means to clean and sanitize bar ware.
The inspector also reported that the door of the cold deli case had a “buildup of mold-like residue” and said the gas-fed, open-flame rotisserie and flat-top grill that were being used lacked “any type of ventilation.”
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint pertaining to adulterated food and food from unsafe sources. “Complaint is closed and unverifiable,” the inspector reported. According to state records, the last time the restaurant was inspected was in October 2022.
Crawford Brew Works, 3659 Devil’s Glen Road, Bettendorf – During a Dec. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector found the restaurant did not have a certified food protection manager on staff to oversee daily operations in the kitchen. Also, a worker was seen handling raw ground beef and then, with the same gloves on, handling a hamburger bun.
In addition, two containers of whipped cream were being held at 49 degrees and had to be discarded; a pan of cooked shrimp prepared several days prior had no date markings; the interior lids, shelves, and walls of all three food-preparation coolers had a “buildup of food debris and soil” on them; there was no thin-tipped probe thermometer in the kitchen for checking the temperature of prepared food products; and a plastic serving cup sitting in a container of cooked corn within a hot-holding unit “appeared to be slowly melting” inside the container of corn.
Minh’s Gourmet, 2215 Ridgeview Drive, Davenport — During a Dec. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector reported seeing the owner touching, with his bare hands, the sweet and sour chicken that was ready to be served to a customer. The inspector intervened and the dish was discarded. Also, rice that was cooked had not cooled below 67 degrees within two hours and had to be discarded.
The restaurant was also storing sprouts at room temperature — a repeat violation the inspector said required long-term corrective action. In addition, the tempura chicken in the walk-in cooler had inaccurate date-markings on it. The owner indicated chicken was made twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and he was given the opportunity to place new date-markings on the chicken.
“Interior of the ice machine has a buildup of grime,” the inspector reported. “Interior of the walk-in cooler – the fans, walls, ceiling and racks — have an excess buildup of dust and debris.”










There is a buildup of food spills and crumbs under and around equipment in the deli area ... The floors in the deli are not clean… License is expired.


– Inspector's report on Bobby's Grocery and Barbecue in Dysart 


Bobby’s Grocery and BBQ, 305 Crisman St., Dysart — During a Dec. 11 visit, a state inspector cited this grocery store and full-service deli for operating without a license and for holding numerous foods at unsafe temperatures — including smoked sausage pasta, fried chicken, potato salad and Oreo fluff. The pasta and chicken were discarded, while the salads were moved to a colder location in the same cooler.
The inspector also reported the business did not have a date-marking system in pace to ensure food was fresh and safe to eat, and some foods had incorrect preparation and discard dates on them. Also, hard boiled eggs, pulled pork, cooked vegetables, cooled nacho cheese sauce, and fried chicken had no preparation or discard dates on them.
The inspector also found that food items that had been prepared and packaged within the store — including smoked sausage pasta, pasta salad, smoked pork roast, and fried chicken — were not labeled with ingredients or allergens.
“There is a buildup of food spills and crumbs under and around equipment in the deli area,” the inspector reported. “The floors in the deli are not clean… License is expired.”
The inspector did not approve the application for a new license, noting that a penalty fee for operating without a license would first have to be paid, and indicated a revisit would be scheduled to confirm corrective action was taken to address some of the violations that were found.
On Dec. 18, another inspection took place and the business was again cited for storing food in a retail sales case at temperatures that were unsafe. Barbecue meats, fried chicken, potato salad, coleslaw, shredded cheese and dessert salad were found to be out of temperature and were discarded. The facility’s license application was then approved.
Supermarket Villachuato, 107 N. Center St., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 9 visit, a state inspector found the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager. The business was cited for using cardboard shipping boxes as a cutting surface for vegetables; for maintaining cooked, shredded meat in a self-service hot case at temperatures of only 119 to 124 degrees; for failing to date-mark house-made salsas and packaged, cooked chickens; for offering a roasted chicken that had an expiration date of Nov. 19; and for selling house-made sauces, pasta, beans and tortillas that were packaged are not labeled with ingredients or allergens.
The visit was in response to a complaint pertaining to food from unsafe sources and cross-contamination of food items. The complaint was deemed verified.
Hotel Blackhawk, 200 E. 3rd St., Davenport — During a Dec. 3 visit, a Scott County inspector cited the hotel’s restaurant for failing to have employed a certified food protection manager with management and supervisory responsibility. In addition, the business was cited for several food items kept outside safe temperature ranges, including cooked chicken at 51 degrees, and shrimp and ground beef at 45 to 50 degrees. Other food items had expired, including cooked chorizo that was date-marked Nov. 19, and house-made sauce dated Nov. 20. The inspector also reported finding diced pineapple and mangos that were date-marked Nov. 24.
Also, excess food debris was noted in a microwave oven, a cooler, a holster for the pop-dispensing gun, and a mixer. The hood vents were “dripping grease” and the floor in the dry storage area had excess dirt and debris, the inspector reported.
Casa Tequila Mexican Restaurant, 4908 N. Pine St., Davenport — During a Nov. 25 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Among the issues: The walk-in cooler was holding all food at a temperature of 43 to 44 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder; two pans of queso were left sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 52 degrees; rice prepared the previous day was not reheated to 165 degrees prior to being put on a steam table; ground beef in the walk-in cooler had not cooled to 41 degrees within six hours and had to be discarded, and rice and queso on the steam table were measured at 107 to 108 degrees and had to be reheated to 165 degrees.
Also, a basin holding raw meat was stored on the floor of the kitchen, frozen meat was being thawed by being left to sit out at room temperature, and non-food-grade plastic grocery bags with ink on them were being used to hold tortillas and to thaw meat.
Fresh Fit Meals, 11881 Hickman Road, Urbandale — During a Nov. 21 visit, a state inspector reported that packaged meals in the retail walk-in cooler were being stored above the maximum of 41 degrees, including the bison hamburger bowl at 46 to 50 degrees, and the Philly bowl at 45 degrees.
Also, the inspector reported, “dates are not transferring from prepared ingredients to prepared meals” — suggesting that the prepared meals had expiration dates that were beyond the expiration dates of some of the individual ingredients. The inspector reported discussing with management the practice of “using the oldest date of ingredients” when determining the expiration date of prepared meals.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-09 15:31:54+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE makes arrests in New Haven as pro-immigrant groups mourn Renee Good,Michayla Savitt | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/09/ice-arrests-new-haven-renee-good/,New Haven police said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested three people in the city Thursday.,"New Haven police say that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested three people in the city Thursday. The news was among a flurry of local and national immigration developments on the minds of immigrant advocates who gathered at a downtown rally later in the day.
The latest arrests show that the advocacy work is far from over, said Kica Matos with the National Immigration Law Center, who was among the rally speakers.
“They were here today in this block snatching people away in broad daylight, and it is happening everywhere,” Matos said.
Few details about the arrests were available Thursday night. ICE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the New Haven Police Department confirmed ICE made three arrests Thursday in downtown.
A department spokesman said ICE officials did notify New Haven police of the action, but local officers were not involved in the arrests.
People at the rally also mourned the death of a Minneapolis woman who was shot and killed Wednesday by an ICE agent.
Fumika Mizuno, a volunteer with the New Haven Immigrants Coalition, led the New Haven crowd in a moment of silence to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three. Mizuno also included all those who have died or disappeared while in ICE custody.
After the crowd held the silence for nearly a minute, Mizuno invited people to lay flowers on the steps of the New Haven Superior Court, where a handwritten sign read: “We will not be complicit.”
“We hold rage and grief and yet we choose to be here together because we transform those into action, and through action we build hope,” Mizuno said.
“If there was ever a time for us to come together, that time is right now,” said Rev. Scott Marks, director of New Haven Rising. “And all the things that would cause us to be separate and apart, I call for solidarity.”
Other vigils were held across Connecticut, including one at an ICE field office in Hartford.
The rallies across the state came soon after Avelo Airlines announced the end of its involvement with federal deportation flights out of Arizona. The news came after months of protests at Tweed New Haven Airport, where Avelo has a significant presence, and a widespread boycott of the airline over the practice.
An Avelo spokesperson said Wednesday that the airline’s decision to end its partnership with ICE was purely financial.
Advocates said Avelo ending its contract does not mean that the group’s advocacy is done. They will keep pushing back against the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement.
“We aren’t going to stop resisting until every loved one, every neighbor, and every family member is home, and we aren’t going to stop until this death machine is abolished. We will keep showing up,” Mizuno said, as the crowd cheered in response.

GLENDALE, Ariz. – Trinidad Chambliss’s last-gasp pass into the end zone, intended for De’Zhaun Stribling, had fallen incomplete. Despite several tugs of Stribling’s jersey and significant contact from a Miami defender, pass interference was not called. The State Farm Stadium scoreboard at the Fiesta Bowl showed Miami with 31 points, Ole Miss with 27. The clock showed all zeroes.
This crazy, often magical 2025 Ole Miss football season finally ended Thursday, eight days into 2026 and one victory short of playing in the national championship game. Many of the Rebel players stared at the scoreboard almost as if in disbelief. Several shed tears while embracing one another. Across the field, Miami players celebrated wildly. Some of them were crying tears of joy. This game dripped drama.

A few minutes later, quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and running back Kewan Lacy trudged off the field together, Chambliss with a towel over his head, Lacy with his arm draped over Chambliss’s shoulder.
There, to greet them in the tunnel leading to the Ole Miss locker room, was former Miami superstar and Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis. Lewis had witnessed the effort the Rebels duo had put forth. Chambliss threw for 277 yards and a touchdown. Lacy, after missing time with a tweaked hamstring and then playing despite it, ran for 103 yards and another touchdown.
Lewis is one of the greatest competitors in football history and knows valor and grit when he sees it. That’s why he was outside Ole Miss’s locker room and not inside Miami’s. He wanted to console the two Rebel offensive stars who had displayed remarkable effort and grit galore. Onlookers couldn’t hear what Lewis said, but we could see he meant it.

Moments later, Lacy, Chambliss and the rest of the Rebels made their way into the locker room where Pete Golding, their head coach, greeted each and every one of them, some with handshakes, some with bear hugs. Golding appeared totally drained, bleary-eyed, exhausted. His Rebels had fought so valiantly, especially after being dominated early in the game when Miami kept the ball for 20 of the game’s first 23 minutes and held Ole Miss to a negative one yard of total offense in the first quarter.
And so Miami will go on to play for the national championship just a few miles from its campus. Ole Miss will begin to build for next year. Lacy will be back for the Rebels. Chambliss hopes to be. Many more of the Rebels who made this the longest and most memorable season in Ole Miss history will be back for another run, having shown, even in Thursday night’s defeat, they belonged on the national stage.
“I can’t tell you how proud I am of this group,” Golding would say in the post-game press conference. “They never flinched, they never panicked … This group created a legacy and an expectation for this program. We didn’t play our best and we didn’t coach our best, but I couldn’t ask any more in terms of effort. … Effort has never been an issue with these guys.”

Anyone who watched the game, no matter your allegiance, knows that, at least on this night, the better team won. Indeed, the bigger, stronger team won, often dominating the line of scrimmage. The Hurricanes possessed the ball for more than 41 of the game’s 60 minutes. Miami ran a whopping 88 plays, compared to just 60 plays for the Rebels.
Miami won the game on third and fourth downs. Ole Miss converted just two of 10 third down plays. Miami converted 11 of 19 third downs and two of two fourth down gambles. The Ole Miss defense just could not get off the field.
Still, Ole Miss, displaying the same doggedness that won the Sugar Bowl over Georgia seven days earlier, stayed in the game. Even when Miami scored the go-ahead touchdown on Carson Beck’s three-yard scramble with 18 seconds remaining, Ole Miss fired back.
Chambliss hit Cayden Lee with a 23-yard strike to near midfield. Thirteen seconds remained. After an incompletion, Chambliss completed a 17-yard laser to Stribling. That left time for one heave to the end zone. Could Chambliss, the miracle worker, do it again? At this point, would anyone have been surprised? Stribling was the target in the left corner of the end zone with heavy coverage from two Miami defenders. There tugs of Stribling’s jersey. There was contact. There was no flag.
Could have been called. Wasn’t.
“That play did not lose us the game,” Golding would say. 
The truth is: Miami, a talented, red-hot team playing its best football when it mattered most, won the game more than Ole Miss lost it. 
Beck, a 23-year-old millionaire, played almost flawlessly, throwing for 268 yards and two touchdowns and running in the game-winner. Bruising running back Mark Fletcher slammed into the line over and over, 22 times for 133 yards, often pushing the pile. Wide receiver Malachi Toney, a marvelously talented, just turned 18-year-old freshman, caught five balls for 81 yards and turned an at-first-harmless-looking quick screen into a highlight reel, 36-yard touchdown dash. Malachi Toney, remember that name. You will be hearing it for years.
Yes, and 6-foot-9 inch, 345-pound Miami left tackle Markell Bell of Cleveland, Mississippi, and Holmes Community College anchored a massive, often dominant Miami offensive line. Miami has now played 15 games. Bell has yet to give up a sack.

So, Ole Miss didn’t lose, so much as Miami won. The Rebels were heroic even in defeat. The team that lost its head coach just as preparations for the playoffs began never surrendered.
Said Golding, when asked about his team’s legacy, “I’ll just remember how they embraced one another. There’s been a lot happen over the last month to where somebody could have not been a good dude. Somebody could have not worked hard. Somebody could have not showed up on time. I can’t recall a single issue. That’s who they are. They just went to work and made sure everyone around them went to work.”
Golding continued, “But to me, I’ll remember the smiles, man. It’s the memories. It’s the laughs. It’s the camaraderie and how they grew together. They’re going to be talking about this for a long, long time right? Some of it will be about what could have happened and all that, but they’ve made memories in that locker room that will last a lifetime.”
Yes, they have. And those of us lucky enough to have witnessed it won’t forget it any time soon.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The two groups that sought to enshrine nonpartisan court races are now united behind a single ballot initiative, CI-132, put forward by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts.
The ballot initiative was one of two nearly identical constitutional initiatives launched to counter a push by Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, throughout the 2025 Legislature to make changes to the state’s judicial system, including allowing judges to run with partisan affiliation.
According to a Thursday press release, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, the group started by Ted Dick and Pepper Peterson that sponsored CI-131, announced their endorsement of CI-132.
The consolidation “signals a united effort to protect Montana voters’ 90-year right to nonpartisan judicial elections,” Dick said in a press release. “Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges believes Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts has a strong policy and the resources to ensure the initiative qualifies for the ballot, which is why we have chosen to formally endorse CI-132.”
Dick has formally requested to withdraw CI-131 with the Montana Secretary of State.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan.
The group gained endorsements from retired Montana Supreme Court Justices Mike McGrath and Pat Cotter, and lists more than 1,000 individual supporters on its website.
The text of CI-132 proposes to amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
“We know that Montanans want to protect their right to judicial elections free from the influence of political parties and politicians,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a statement. “We are proud to stand with those who have endorsed CI-131 and CI-132 and begin the work of qualifying this critical initiative for the November ballot.”
The process to get the ballot initiative before voters has already hit some bumps, including a brief legal challenge against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office initially approved the ballot measure as legally sufficient, but rewrote the language of the proposed ballot statement, arguing it did not inform voters what “nonpartisan” meant.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Schwab reported $1.3 million in campaign contributions as of Dec. 31, while Democrat Ethan Corson attracted $900,000 in donations to fuel his campaign for governor.
Schwab and Corson released information on their 2025 fundraising reports ahead of the Monday deadline for submitting financial documents to the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission and Kansas Secretary of State’s office.
So far, more than a dozen candidates have announced campaigns for the Republican or Democratic party nominations for governor in Kansas. Their capacity to generate significant donations would be viewed as a measure of political viability in terms of the August primaries. In 2022, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly raised more than $7.7 million for her successful reelection campaign.
Schwab, who has served as Kansas’ secretary of state since 2019, said his campaign for governor attracted more than $1.3 million.
“These results show support for the only conservative in the race with a comprehensive plan for addressing the Kansas property tax crisis,” he said. “Kansans want a leader who will do more than share hollow rhetoric about issues, but put forth solutions that put the taxpayer first.”
Schwab’s most prominent GOP rivals include former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt. They haven’t announced fundraising totals yet.

Corson, a Democratic state senator from Johnson County, said he accepted more than 3,000 contributions and that 70% of these donations were for less than $100. He reported securing more than $900,000 since July. His rival in the primary is Sen. Cindy Holscher, also of Johnson County. She has not yet released campaign donation information.
“Our campaign is about creating a Kansas where the next generation can build a life right here, and this milestone is proof that people all across the state believe in that vision,” Corson said.
During the 2025 portion of the campaign cycle, Corson said his campaign traveled 11,000 miles to dozens of cities. He’s been endorsed by more than 10 labor unions as well as Kelly, who referred to him as “most suited” to be the next governor.
In the campaign for attorney general, Democrat Chris Mann officially filed as a candidate and said his campaign raised $536,000 in 2025. Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach said he would run for reelection but hasn’t released a summary of his campaign treasurer’s report. In 2022, Kobach received 50.8% of the vote to narrowly defeat Mann, who claimed 49.2% of ballots cast.
Mann said 89% of his 2,500 contributions came from Kansans, which he said was an indication of momentum of his second campaign for attorney general.
“Kansans want an attorney general who is focused on protecting communities, upholding the law fairly, and delivering real results, not playing politics,” Mann said. “The record level of support we’re seeing makes it clear that people are ready for a new direction in the attorney general’s office.”
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, said he generated $427,300 during 2025 for his campaign for state insurance commissioner.
He asserted the total “breaks all previous records for down-ballot races at this point in the election cycle,” comparing it to campaigns for secretary of state, state treasurer and insurance commissioner in 2014, 2018 and 2022. He didn’t acknowledge Mann’s higher total in the campaign for attorney general.

Over time, some cities have met the state’s criteria without being added to the list, while others no longer qualify yet continue to reap the benefits. Oversight of the designations seems to have been lost.","THE TERM “Gateway City” was first coined in a 2007 report published by MassINC (the nonprofit civic organization that also publishes CommonWealth Beacon) and originally described just 11 midsize cities outside of Greater Boston that were, and still are, struggling regional economic centers. These cities were major manufacturing hubs yet suffered from the same decline that beset much of the country in the decades since World War II. 
But they are also communities with assets – historic architecture, museums, universities, and walkable neighborhoods and downtowns – that make them attractive places for investment. They are home to nearly 40 percent of the state’s foreign-born residents, and for many, they are a “gateway” to the American dream.
In 2009 and 2010, Beacon Hill took note of these communities around the state and recognized the need to financially support their economic development efforts. The Legislature codified an official definition of Gateway Cities in state law and began setting aside funds to help redevelop the qualifying communities.
But despite lawmakers’ good intentions, the statute failed to create a clear enforcement mechanism to periodically review each city’s eligibility. Over time, some cities have met the state’s criteria without being added to the list, while others no longer qualify yet continue to reap the benefits. Beacon Hill hasn’t made changes to the list of qualifying cities since 2013. Since then, oversight of the designations seems to have been lost.
State statute defines a Gateway City as any city with a population greater than 35,000 but less than 250,000, a median household income below the statewide average, and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher that is below the state average. Under that definition, 24 cities originally qualified for the status under the law. But in 2013, former Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration added Attleboro and Peabody to the list after their median household incomes dipped below the statewide average, bringing the total to 26.
Today, those 26 former industrial cities continue to compete for tax credits and millions of dollars in housing and economic development funds from a number of programs that target Gateway Cities. Over the years, there have been many legislative attempts to revise the state’s eligibility criteria – none of which have been successful.

But there are three current Gateway Cities – Salem, Methuen, and Quincy – that do not qualify for the status under the state’s current criteria. Methuen’s median household income has just surpassed the state average. Data from the most recent five-year American Community Survey show that nearly 50 percent of Salem residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher – a bit more than the statewide average. In Quincy, nearly 49 percent of residents now have a bachelor’s degree or higher, just surpassing the state average.
Two cities – Weymouth and Marlborough – now meet all three criteria to be considered Gateway Cities under state statute, according to the Census Bureau’s most recent data, yet they are not reaping the benefits of the designation.
So, who is in charge of the designations? Beacon Hill doesn’t seem to know.
The statute doesn’t charge an office, department, or agency with periodically reviewing which cities meet the criteria, leaving no path for cities to be added or removed. It also doesn’t explicitly state which entity is supposed to enforce the law. However, the tax incentive program under which the legal definition of Gateway Cities was created – the Economic Development Incentive Program, which awards tax credits for job creation – is overseen by the secretary of economic development.
The Executive Office of Economic Development emphasized that it remains committed to providing funding and programs to Gateway Cities but argued that the statute does not authorize or require them to review which cities and towns meet the criteria. The office did not respond when asked if Secretary Eric Paley would rectify the situation.
State Rep. Antonio Cabral, a New Bedford Democrat who co-chairs the Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus, said even if a community meets all three criteria and wants to be considered a Gateway City, it needs to have a history of deindustrialization and should be a regional center of economic activity – even though those “requirements” are not actually written in the state law.
“Sometimes we read the so-called metrics or criteria too literally,” he said. “That historical designation is not written down in any way, but that’s part of the concept.”
It’s true that Marlborough and Weymouth meet the “letter” of the law, but when asked if they meet the “spirit” of the law, Cabral hedged.
“I think I would leave it in the form of a question. Do they think they meet that historical definition?” he said.
Cabral said he would be opposed to removing cities from the official list because they no longer meet all three criteria, arguing that it is in the state’s interest to continue investing in the development of those cities. But he also emphasized that funding for the 26 Gateway Cities is already limited, and programs like the Housing Development Incentive Program – a market-rate housing tax incentive program exclusively for Gateway Cities – are competitive enough as it is.
“My role is to make sure that we don’t keep dividing the pot. My role is to make sure that pot gets fuller,” Cabral said.
Sen. John Cronin, a Fitchburg Democrat who also chairs the Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus, had a different take.
“I am a proponent of addition,” Cronin said. “The bigger coalition that you can build of communities that are advocating together for equitable state investments, community development, and economic development benefits everybody in the state.”
Cronin argued that Quincy, Salem, and Methuen are proof that the state’s targeted grant programs and funding opportunities are working and have helped to create more mixed-income communities. In order for the definition of a Gateway City to change, or for a new city to be added, Cronin said the Legislature would need to act.
“There are more conversations happening in the Legislature now between members than I have seen in the past about whether we should increase the size or relook at what makes a Gateway City,” he said.
Cabral believes Gov. Maura Healey’s administration and the Executive Office of Economic Development are the ones in control of the policy, and legislation is not necessary. Healey’s office declined to answer questions about whether her administration would tweak the current list as former Gov. Patrick’s administration did in 2013.
All of this has left lawmakers like Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who represents Marlborough, confused. He told CommonWealth Beacon he is trying to understand how the city can officially be considered for the grants and benefits, but his questions have gone mostly unanswered.
“So far in our outreach to the Executive Office of Economic Development, there has been no point person for Gateway Cities to make this inquiry,” Eldridge said. “I’m trying to get more answers on what the Legislature plans to do on this, or the executive branch.”

Eldridge said the funding, grants, and tax incentives would be “significant” for Marlborough, which has struggled to build enough affordable housing.
Gateway Cities are eligible and prioritized for multiple state aid programs, including the Gateway Housing Rehabilitation Program, which provides funds to develop blighted residential properties, Greening the Gateway Cities, which provides grants to cities and nonprofits for tree planting, and the Transformative Development Initiative, which provides assistance and grants to support economic growth in Gateway City downtowns and commercial districts.
“There are current Gateway Cities that have become wealthier, and if the general idea is that a Gateway City is supposed to be prioritized because it’s either less well off or is unable to do the investments on its own, how does that impact the bigger discussion about how to most wisely use our taxpayer dollars?” Eldridge said.
Sen. Patrick O’Connor, a Republican who represents Weymouth, only recently realized the city meets the criteria after CommonWealth Beacon reached out. He said in an interview that he is excited about Weymouth’s eligibility, which could open the door to valuable economic development funding opportunities for the city.
“It’d be huge. We have one of the largest undeveloped parcels of land in the entire state … we also have no downtown in Weymouth,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to learn about the process, or help in the creation of the process for that matter.” 
Recognizing that the statute is vague, O’Connor emphasized the need to “tighten up the process in which this all happens.”
“The long-term goal of the Gateway City designation is to … have growth and development inside of your community that will lead you, hopefully, to a point in time where the designation is no longer necessary,” O’Connor said.
Recently, lawmakers have raised questions and proposals seeking to define Gateway Cities in a way that encompasses more communities.
State Sen. Bill Driscoll, who represents the town of Randolph which has long hovered near the threshold of the state’s three criteria, introduced a bill in 2025 that would add two additional criteria – having a population makeup of at least 40 percent people of color and having 15 percent or more of households that speak English less than “very well.”
Municipalities meeting any three of the five categories would be considered a Gateway City. Under that definition, Randolph would qualify, but so would seven other towns and cities, including Boston and a town of less than 5,000 on the island of Martha’s Vineyard.
The bill would also charge the secretary of economic development with certifying which municipalities qualify after each decennial census and would give the office the ability to move a community on or off the list at any point mid-decade using annual estimates from the Census Bureau.
Another bill proposed in 2025 by Sen. Paul Mark – representing Berkshire County and the westernmost towns of Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties – would allow two or more municipalities to combine to satisfy the first criterion, which requires a qualifying city’s population to be greater than 35,000.
The Legislature may be hesitant to add or remove cities from the list now. Two of the four most powerful people in the Massachusetts state government have ties to the Gateway Cities coalition.
Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll was the former mayor of Salem – a city that technically no longer qualifies for the designation. And in order for legislative action to be taken, House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka would need to be on board. But the speaker appears to be in the middle of the issue – literally. His district is made up of parts of both Quincy, a city that no longer qualifies, and Weymouth, a city that does. Mariano’s office declined to comment on the matter. Spilka did not respond to a request for comment.

Lawmakers’ longstanding desire for the cities and towns they represent to be considered for the opportunities set aside for Gateway Cities is nothing new. But when the term was first coined, there was some resistance it, according to John Schneider, interim president and CEO of MassINC at the time of the 2007 report. It was first seen as a negative label for low-income, struggling cities.
Schneider developed the “Gateway City” name to describe the communities in a positive way, rather than referring to them as “third tier” or “weak market” cities. They were and still are a gateway to the American dream and the middle class, he said.
“All of a sudden, these cities were being reframed as places of opportunity, so legislators wanted to define the communities in a way that resulted in more cities being designated as Gateway Cities and benefiting from the programs that were being developed,” Schneider said.
As for the three cities that no longer meet all three criteria, some have raised concerns.
The Patriot Ledger reported in June on local objections to a zoning change in Quincy that resulted in a new developer being eligible for significant tax breaks on a large-scale residential and retail project in the city center. The zoning change qualified the projects for tax incentives through the Housing Development Incentive Program. One resident compared the proposal to welfare fraud, arguing the tax breaks were unwarranted because Quincy is no longer a Gateway City by law.
If neither Healey, the Executive Office of Economic Development, nor the Legislature acts, the current list of Gateway Cities will likely remain unchanged.
“Just speaking to the financial realities of where the state is, I think there probably would be some concern about dramatically expanding which communities have that Gateway City status,” Eldridge said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/000statehousedome.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

The outcome will reach far beyond the state’s borders.
The trial, which will include testimony from abortion providers, Planned Parenthood leadership and anti-abortion doctors, will give an unusually detailed look at the inner-workings of abortion in Missouri, highlighting how just one or two restrictions on the procedure can greatly weaken access in a state where few providers remain.
Over the course of two weeks, the details of Missouri’s numerous abortion regulations will be under a microscope as those in favor of abortion rights argue that nearly every restriction is unconstitutional under the reproductive rights amendment and the state argues the regulations are necessary protections. 
The outcome of Missouri’s reproductive rights amendment case — which will either greatly broaden access to abortion in ways not seen in decades, or will hamper access for nearly everyone in Missouri — will reverberate far beyond the Show-Me State, said Rebecca Reingold, an associate director at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

This is particularly true, she said, of states also in the process of litigating abortion access like Arizona, Michigan and Ohio.
“There is little doubt that advocates and decision-makers in other states navigating similar legal challenges are closely monitoring the litigation over Missouri’s abortion regulations,” Reingold said. “ … While state court judges are certainly not bound to follow the decisions of their peers in other states, these decisions can serve as persuasive legal authority, particularly in cases involving novel legal questions or where the relevant legal standards are evolving.” 
The result of Missouri’s lawsuit will also greatly affect the landscape of abortion access in the Midwest and the South. 
“Missouri also neighbors states with some of the harshest abortion bans in the country,” she said. “That means that the outcome of this litigation will be felt beyond the state’s geographic borders, affecting access to care not only for Missourians, but also people living in neighboring states.”
The case originated with a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri the day after the November 2024 election in which voters narrowly approved broad abortion access, becoming the first state to overturn a near-total abortion ban through a vote of the people.
Maggie Olivia, a senior policy manager with Abortion Action Missouri, embraces abortion-rights supporters after the race is called in favor of Amendment 3 on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Amy Myrick, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Missouri is a harbinger for other states attempting to secure abortion protections through constitutional changes.
“Missouri is a test case for what happens when the people have spoken and passed the constitutional amendment with the strongest possible protections, but the state still decides to stand in their way, and the courts have to decide what to do,” she said. 
Hypothetically, Myrick said, this should be an open and shut case because Missouri’s reproductive rights amendment was written with some of the strongest protections of any amendment in the country. The amendment prohibits the government from regulating abortion prior to the point of fetal viability unless “such action is justified by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.” 
“So if courts start upholding restrictions against these kinds of protections,” Myrick said. ‘That’s a really bad sign.”
Right now, most of the targeted regulation of abortion provider laws, known as TRAP laws, have been temporarily enjoined — or paused — until a permanent decision could be made at trial.
This includes required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion; a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion; and abortion facility licensing requirements. The injunction allowed Planned Parenthood to begin offering in-clinic abortions last February. 
Between then and October, 80 in-clinic abortion procedures took place in Missouri across Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. In 2023 and. 2024, there were no elective abortions performed in Missouri. A few decades ago, prior to the passage of most of Missouri’s abortion restrictions and 2022 ban, thousands of abortions were performed in the state each year. Current data shows several thousand Missourians still accessed abortion in 2024, but had to travel to Illinois or Kansas to do so.
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

Zhang did not enjoin two regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing providers from prescribing medication abortion: a complication plan approved by the state as well as supplemental insurance requirement. For this reason, Missouri doctors remain unable to prescribe the medications mifepristone and misoprostol to patients to end first trimester pregnancies. Medication abortion is the most common method to end a pregnancy in the United States, used in about two-thirds of abortions.
Anti-abortion advocates contend repealing these regulations could put women’s safety at risk. 
“Like Michigan and Ohio before them, the amendment was the first step, opening the door for the abortion lobby to tear down all of the health and safety standards for women’s protections that the Missouri legislature required over the years,” said Katie Glenn Daniel, director of legal affairs and policy counsel at SBA Pro-Life America.
Myrick said attempts to tie regulations to health and safety claims are nothing new. 
“Every single one of these restrictions is about hostility to abortion, making it harder to access abortion,” she said. “Even something like a complication plan can be a shutdown law if it’s impossible to comply with. So there’s no way this is about health or safety.”
She said Missouri anti-abortion leaders have long been creative, spearheading many of the national fights against mifepristone in particular. 
Stickers saying “repeal and replace Amendment 3,” the name of the 2024 reproductive rights amendment, are distributed during Missouri Right to Life advocacy day at the Missouri State Capitol in March 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
In November, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway sued over the latest approval of a generic version of mifepristone, asking the federal government to overturn the approval and to reinstate in-person dispensing laws for the medication, which can currently be prescribed in some states during telehealth appointments and then mailed to patients.
Last summer, Hanaway’s predecessor, Andrew Bailey, sued Planned Parenthood over its claims that mifepristone is safer to take than over-the-counter medications like Tylenol, penicillin and Viagra. 
And Missouri is now the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit seeking to limit the availability of medication abortion. The case originated in Texas and moved all the way up to the United States Supreme Court before the nation’s highest court said the original plaintiffs didn’t have the jurisdiction to sue.
Sarah Wetter, senior associate with the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown Law, said the transfer of the federal case to Missouri makes the state litigation beginning Monday “all the more threatening” as the Missouri Attorney General’s Office also prepares to argue against mifepristone at the federal courthouse in St. Louis.
“Turning back the clock to pre-2016 rules would limit mifepristone access to patients up to 7 (rather than 10) weeks gestation, require more in-person visits, and otherwise prohibit telemedicine abortion,” Wetter said.
Many high-ranking Missouri politicians have shown repeatedly that abortion remains among their highest priorities, with few saying they’ll back down if the abortion rights amendment is fully implemented following the trial. A prime example of this is the Republican supermajority’s success in putting a proposed abortion ban on this year’s November ballot. Plans are already underway to continue attempting to limit access to the procedure, whether the abortion ban amendment passes or fails later this year.
Politics are supposed to be left out of the courtroom, said Michael Wolff, a former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and dean emeritus at the St. Louis University School of Law. He’s curious if that will be the case next week.
“The courts, in my experience in Missouri, have always been solicitous of what the voters were voting on,” he said.
Wolff, who advised in the drafting of the abortion rights amendment, said any arguments by the state that abortion regulations are necessary because Missouri voters didn’t realize the scope of what they were voting on should be heeded cautiously.
“Haven’t these political issues, these questions about the desirability of this law, already been litigated when they had to campaign where the voters approved (abortion)?” Wolff said. “ … It’s not a matter for the courts to decide whether the voters were dumb or or smart when they did this.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8172-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

In Connecticut, a commercial driver can have their commercial driver’s license, or CDL, suspended or disqualified after a DUI arrest in any vehicle, even before a conviction. 
For CDL holders, a DUI triggers a criminal court case and an administrative action by the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Under Connecticut’s process, the DMV can suspend a CDL if a driver fails or refuses a chemical test, or if test results show an elevated blood alcohol level. In most cases, the suspension takes effect within about 45 days unless the driver requests a DMV hearing, usually within 10 to 15 days.
A BAC of 0.04% — lower than the 0.08% needed by non-commercial drivers for a DUI — while operating a commercial vehicle can lead to disqualification. Refusing a test typically results in a one-year CDL disqualification, longer if hazardous materials are involved.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Trump administration made its opinion known almost immediately after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday: The officer acted heroically in defending himself from Renee Nicole Good, who was intent on running him over with her Honda Pilot in an act of “domestic terrorism.”
“The officer, fearing for his life and other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a news conference in Minneapolis.
A jury might very well disagree after seeing footage of the incident, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey who called ICE’s claim of self-defense “bullsh*t.”
But the Trump administration seems intent on blocking local prosecutors from even bringing charges against the ICE officer, who the Star Tribune identified as Jonathan Ross.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office took the unusual step soon after the shooting of ousting the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation into the killing.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings in the state, and was on the scene in south Minneapolis on Wednesday collecting evidence as part of a joint investigation with the FBI.
Then the U.S. Attorney’s Office “reversed course” and decided the investigation would be led solely by the FBI, said Drew Evans, BCA superintendent, in a statement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz during a Thursday press conference expressed doubt about the results of any investigation conducted by the federal government because Minnesota officials have been purposefully excluded.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said. “People in positions of power have already passed judgment … and told you things that are verifiably false.”
If federal investigators don’t share their findings with local prosecutors, they’ll struggle to put together a case to bring charges, said former Acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Anders Folk, who brought federal charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd in 2020.
“I don’t know how any prosecutor could make a charging decision without facts,” Folk said. “The local authorities are going to have to figure out a way to do their own investigation if they want to be able to evaluate whether a criminal charge can be brought.”
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who has jurisdiction in Minneapolis, said in a statement on Thursday that her office is searching for a way for a state level investigation to continue.
“If the FBI is the sole investigative agency, the state will not receive the investigative findings, and our community may never learn about its contents,” Moriarty said in a statement.
The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will make charging decisions based on the FBI investigation, pointed the Reformer to a post on X when asked if she has commented on the case and if she believes the use of force was justified.
“Obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement is a federal crime. So is damaging federal property. If you cross that red line, you will be arrested and prosecuted. Do not test our resolve,” the post says.
Who might do a local investigation is unclear. Folk, who is now running for Hennepin County attorney, said he’s not aware of any cases of officers shooting someone in Minnesota in which the BCA was not involved.
“They are the law enforcement organization that we as Minnesotans look to do this kind of investigative work,” Folk said.
If the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is able to complete a criminal investigation and file charges, they face another difficult task: convincing a federal judge that the ICE officer was not acting reasonably in carrying out his lawful federal duties.
If state charges are filed, the officer will likely ask to move his case to federal court to assert immunity under what’s known as the Supremacy Clause, which protects federal officials from state criminal prosecution if they are reasonably carrying out their duties.
Whether the officer’s actions are deemed lawful could hinge on a range of facts from his training to his duties to his subjective beliefs and the U.S. Supreme Court has provided only minimal guidance on how to answer that question, according to Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Still, she emphasized local prosecutors can and have brought charges against federal officials.
“The baseline understanding here is that states can prosecute federal officials when they violate state criminal laws,” Godar said.
If state prosecutors convince a federal judge the officer’s actions were not reasonable, they could continue bringing the case in federal court on state crimes. That’s significant because a conviction for a state crime cannot not be pardoned by the president.
Godar points in a recent article to cases going back to antebellum, when free states charged U.S. marshals for capturing enslaved people under the Fugitive Slave Act. During the Prohibition Era, local prosecutors charged federal officers for using excessive force in shutting down distilleries.
More recently, local prosecutors in Idaho brought a charge of involuntary manslaughter against an FBI sniper who shot and killed an unarmed woman during the siege on Ruby Ridge in 1992. A divided federal appeals court ruled that the case could proceed because of disputed facts over whether the agent acted “reasonably.”
“Where we see those state prosecutions going ahead is where the use of force is deemed unreasonable or excessive or unlawful,” Godar said.
But that case may offer a cautionary tale for Minnesota: The case wasn’t allowed to proceed until 2001, nearly a decade later. Then the case was dropped by the newly elected prosecutor.
Good’s killing was the ninth shooting by an immigration officer in just the past four months and at least the second killing, with all of them involving firing at people in vehicles, according to a New York Times report. On Thursday, ICE agents shot two more people in Portland, Ore.
In each of the recent ICE shootings, the government has claimed the officer was acting in self-defense.
A 2024 investigation by The Trace and Business Insider found in 23 fatal shootings by ICE officers from 2015 to 2021, no officers were indicted.
Minnesota prosecutors have won convictions in recent years against officers for killing people in the line of duty — Chauvin, Kim Potter and Mohamed Noor — but they are rare and juries are generally reluctant to convict.
Yet even if a conviction seems unlikely, filing charges allows local prosecutors to register a strong protest against ICE’s aggressive enforcement actions in the state and communicate that officers may not operate with impunity. Not charging would be an admission that federal agents are immune from local accountability as the Trump administration pushes for mass deportation.
Folk said a transparent investigation with clear standards is also important for the public’s faith in the justice system
“Minnesota has seen firsthand how important it is to do these high-profile investigations the right way,” Folk said. “We deserve a good, thorough investigation, free of any kind of influence.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_871-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 09:59:01.176377

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined four other Republicans and the Senate’s Democrats in a 52-47 procedural vote that advances the resolution. If adopted, the resolution would direct the “removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.”
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was among the 47 senators, all Republicans, who voted against moving the resolution from committee and to the Senate floor. 
Both Murkowski and Sullivan supported President Donald Trump’s decision to launch an attack on Venezuela that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
The country’s interior minister said Wednesday that 100 people were killed in the attack. Seven U.S. soldiers were injured, according to the Defense Department. Maduro and his wife appeared in U.S. court on Monday.
Since the attack, Trump has said he intends to take over the nation’s oil industry and direct Venezuela’s government.
In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump said the only limit on his international powers is his “own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”
In a statement after Thursday’s vote, Murkowski said that only congressional authorization could permit American troops to remain in Venezuela.
She reiterated her support for the raid that removed Maduro, saying “Venezuela — along with the world — is better off without him in power.”
Many nations officially view Maduro as a dictator.
But Murkowski also said that the United States must have a “clear and achievable end goal” for the country after Maduro’s departure.
“Any future use of force or significant policy shift in Venezuela must include robust congressional oversight and authorization, consistent with our constitutional responsibilities, the rule of law, and a clear assessment of the benefits to the American people,” Murkowski said.
In December, Sullivan told the Huffington Post that he didn’t think having troops on the ground in Venezuela was a good idea.
If the resolution were enacted, the United States would be unable to legally have troops on the ground without congressional approval.  
He did not have a public comment on his vote Thursday, and a spokesperson referred to a statement he made Jan. 3, after the attack that ended with Maduro’s capture.
“The lessons learned from what took place after the United States deposed another Latin American indicted drug lord — Panama’s Manuel Noriega in 1989 — could prove useful, as could the painful and difficult lessons learned after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003,” that statement said in part.

The state owes her business, Rising Sun Learning Center, around $49,000 in payments as part of a subsidy program that reimburses child care providers who serve low-income and foster children.
Invoices for December appear to be at a standstill, and state officials haven’t given her an estimated payment date. And Huffman is not alone.

Missouri is waiting on $25.7 million from the federal government that was supposed to be paid in December. With invoices unfulfilled and little explanation from state officials, day care operators are concerned about the stability of the subsidy program.
“So many people are saying, ‘I can’t keep my doors open and this (inconsistency) still be a thing.’ So a lot of people are just jumping ship from subsidies,” Huffman told The Independent. “At this point, I can’t really blame them.”
Missouri families must earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify for a full benefit. In 2025, that was $48,225 for a family of four. Families earning up to 215% of the federal poverty rate can qualify to pay for child care on a sliding scale.
State lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe approved a budget of $286 million in state and federal funding to run the program this fiscal year, along with an increased subsidy rate. More than 90% of the program’s funding comes from the U.S. Administration of Children and Families’s Child Care and Development Block Grant.
Huffman, a former case worker, has watched foster families struggle to find a day care that accepts subsidized students. The subsidy comes with extra obstacles and required training, and these sort of hiccups only further the frustration.
“When it comes down to either you get off the program and actually get paid and your business survives or you help those people, that’s an impossible choice for a lot of these childcare providers,” she said. “We are in (child care) to help kids and families, but we have to be able to function and keep our doors open in order to be able to help anybody.”
The reason for the delay is unclear and as invoices sit unpaid, day care operators are becoming increasingly anxious.
The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s Office of Childhood told providers Wednesday that it is “communicating with federal stakeholders” and that it “believes payments are being delayed due to the holidays and scheduled maintenance of the payment management system.”
But the agency doesn’t know with certainty what is causing the pause because the federal government has not communicated with the state. And it is not just Missouri that has been impacted, as payments appear at a standstill nationwide according to advocacy group Child Care Aware of America.
The federal fund drew national attention after a video posted in December by a right-wing social media influencer alleged that Somali-run child care providers in Minnesota were collecting money for day cares that weren’t serving any children. Minnesota state inspectors have since reported that daycares in the video are operating normally.
The allegations led to a freeze in payments for five states — all with Democrat-led governments— and a nationwide policy requiring states to justify their child care expenses.
“Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,” U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said in a social media post.
Payment backlog leaves Missouri child care providers desperate, on the brink of closing

Casey Hanson, deputy director at Kids Win Missouri, said that while child care providers in the state have experienced payment delays before, announcements from Washington about child care have formed a “confusing rapid fire.”
Providers operating on tight margins can’t always afford delayed payments, which directly impacts children and families, she told The Independent.
“If providers don’t get paid, they’re going to start closing their doors, and families and children aren’t going to be able to access care,” Hanson said.
This is exactly what happened when the state changed software providers to manage the subsidy payments in December of 2023. Day cares shuttered as the state racked up a backlog of missed payments that was not 100% cleared until last February.
The strain of the backlog is still felt today, and some providers are revisiting the idea of stopping service to families who use the subsidy program.
“(Disruption) closes our doors,” Huffman said. “Most of us are on laser-thin budgets… So I can make payroll tomorrow, but the next one is getting questionable.”

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) A 2025 report on osprey nests, compiled by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, shows a record year of observations for the species which was virtually nonexistent in the state prior to reintroduction efforts in 1997. 
The nest monitoring program is primarily facilitated by volunteers who observe the nests several times during breeding and nesting season to determine if the nest was successful in fledging young osprey. 
According to the latest report, 20 additional nests were monitored in 2025 than in 2024. In total, Iowans monitored 70 osprey nests in 2025 – 54 of which were active nests. In 2024, the state monitored 39 active nests. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2025, 30 nests were deemed successful, meaning at least one young bird survived to the age of being able to fly, compared to 25 successful nests in 2024. 
The report said the growing number of nests show that osprey populations have increased in Iowa and so has nest reporting. 
Ospreys are large birds that feed on fish, making them an indicator of stream and fish health. The birds have white underbellies with dark markings on their wings and around their eyes. The bird is also unique for its ability to close its nostrils when underwater, which aids in its ability to hunt for fish. 
Osprey populations declined in the U.S. with the popularization of the chemical DDT in the 1950s, according to DNR. While populations rebounded slightly following the ban of DDT in the 1970s, the birds had to be reintroduced to Iowa. 
From 1997 until 2016, juvenile birds were relocated from Minnesota and Wisconsin to strategic locations in Iowa. Now, ospreys return to Iowa to breed each year and the populations, according to observations from DNR, continue to increase. 
Ospreys have a strong, recorded presence around Des Moines, in Black Hawk County, Dickinson County, Linn County and Johnson County, with some monitored nests on the state’s western edge. 
According to the report, the new nests recorded this year were primarily around the Des Moines metropolitan area and in Black Hawk County near the Cedar Falls-Waterloo area.
While there were more overall nests monitored in 2025, the ratio of successful nests, at 56%, declined from 2024 when 64% of nests were successful. 
Despite a lower success rate, the overall number of young ospreys that fledged increased from 47 in 2024 to 58 in 2025. Those figures are significantly higher than the observed survivals in 2021 through 2023, when an average of 29 young ospreys fledged. 
Of the observed nests, 12, or 22%, had an unknown outcome, which is slightly lower than the percent of nests with an unknown outcome from 2024. 
DNR, in the report, thanked the volunteers for their reporting and said the department will work to continue improving the figure in the future. 
Osprey nests are typically located on tall structures – more than 80% of active nests in 2025 were on cellular towers. Iowans who spot an osprey nest in their area and are interested in helping to monitor the nest can contact DNR’s volunteer wildlife monitoring program.

Gov. Gavin Newsom will deliver his preliminary state spending plan today — his final budget proposal as California’s governor. On his plate: A projected $18 billion budget gap for 2026-27; the loss of some federal funding; and continued economic uncertainty under President Donald Trump.
During his State of the State address Thursday, the governor dropped hints about his budget, including “significant investments in public education” that entails fully funding the state’s universal transitional kindergarten program, an additional $1 billion to expand high-need schools and more than $27,400 investment per student. (In 2022–23, the state spent about $20,500 per pupil, or $2,800 more than the national average of nearly $17,700).
Newsom also plans to overhaul how California’s schools are run: The governor-appointed, 11-member State Board of Education would take over the California Department of Education, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones. This would give the governor more influence over the education system. Currently, schools sometimes get conflicting messages on how students should be taught, and this change could lead to kids getting more consistent instruction.
The governor also addressed California’s housing shortage during his speech, arguing that investors are “snatching up homes by the hundreds and thousands at a time, crushing the dream of home ownership.” 
It’s a sentiment Newsom shares with Trump, report CalMatters’ Ben Christopher and Jeanne Kuang. Though details remain scant for now, Newsom’s administration plans to work with the Legislature to curb housing ownership by corporate landlords. But some evidence suggests that the issue is overblown: Companies that own at least 10 properties own fewer than 3% of all single-family homes in California.
More specifics about how Newsom wants to fund education and housing will likely be revealed in today’s budget plan, as well as homelessness and mental health services and Medi-Cal. As Jeanne explains, the governor presented an optimistic financial outlook during his State of the State, saying that revenues came in $42 billion higher than expected.
These gains could help Newsom avoid conflict with Democratic lawmakers over program cuts during budget negotiations, though progressives said they’ll continue to push for new taxes — such as a proposed “billionaires tax” that Newsom opposes — to counteract federal cuts.

Faculty diversity still lacking in academia

Though the number of Latino college students is growing at a faster clip, the number of Latino faculty members who can help mentor these students remains lacking, write Angel Corzo and Brittany Oceguera of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
All but one of California State University’s 22 campuses have at least 25% of full-time Latino undergraduate students. Yet, as of fall 2024, only 15% of Cal State instructors are Latino. To reach parity with the number of Latino students, the university system would need to hire more than 13,000 Latino educators.
A spokesperson for Cal State cites low national numbers of Latinos entering graduate programs for the lack of Latinos in academia. Faculty members also argue that limited mentorship and low promotion of programs that help Latinos earn doctoral degrees act as barriers.
As a result, Latino educators — who oftentimes are in non-tenured positions with lower pay — find themselves taking on more mentorship tasks.

Dirk Horn, a Latino political science lecturer at Cal State Bakersfield: “There’s a lot of cultural taxation. That’s the biggest problem with a lack of diversity in higher education, the diverse faculty take on more work.”

These organizations can help with post-fire soil testing

Modern houses are brimming with synthetic chemicals and materials that can be found in numerous possessions such as electronics, furniture and cookware. When flames consume homes, remnants of these chemicals, metals and plastics are released in the air or settle in the soil. 
But in the aftermath of the Palisades and Eaton fires a year ago, no federal- or state-sponsored soil testing took place, reports Katharine Gammon for CalMatters. Instead, other organizations have been forced to step in.
Los Angeles County Public Health, for example, set aside as much as $3 million to fund free soil lead testing for residents living near the wildfires’ burn areas. CAP.LA, funded by the R&S Kayne foundation, connects people with free soil and water testing. The University of Southern California also launched a soil testing program known as USC Clean.

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)“Do we spend the money when they’re so young so they have the chance to become good productive citizens, or do we spend it on them in juvenile correction facilities or adult prisons? I am convinced from all the research that one way or the other, we will spend the money.”
The above quote comes from a 1999 letter by South Dakota Gov. Bill Janklow to a Belle Fourche resident. Earlier that year, during his State of the State speech, Janklow announced his administration would study whether to recommend state funding for preschool.
Today, South Dakota is one of six states without a state-funded preschool program. The state’s prison population has grown by 56% since 1999, and in 2025, the Prison Policy Initiative reported that South Dakota incarcerates women at a rate higher than any other state or country.
This trend stuffed the state’s correctional facilities, leading to overcrowding that state officials could no longer ignore. For the past five years, the state has pooled surplus COVID-19 stimulus dollars and other revenue to fund two new prisons: a women’s prison in Rapid City, and a men’s prison in Sioux Falls. The combined price tag is nearly $750 million.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

Since 1999, lawmakers have tried to slow the growth of the prison population — including with the legislative adoption of a 2013 criminal justice reform package that shifted the state’s focus more toward parole for nonviolent offenders.
Those efforts continue today with a state task force looking closer at ways to rehabilitate people in prison and prevent them from committing more crimes after their release.
One approach the state has yet to try is a state-funded preschool program.
According to a study in Chicago, children who attended preschool had a 25% reduced rate of felony arrests as adults.
At the end of fiscal year 2025, there were 350 people incarcerated in South Dakota’s prison system who were 24 or younger. The average cost per offender per day was $93.26. Had the state committed funding to preschool when Janklow considered it in 1999, that number could be more like 262 — a reduction of 88 inmates and a savings of just under $3 million annually. That’s money that could be used elsewhere.
The savings would grow with time. One of the many reasons Rapid City took steps to become an early learner community in the early 2010s was to reduce interactions with law enforcement.
Preschool can be part of the solution to the state’s prison population problem. Molding minds at a young age also comes with other benefits, including increased school readiness, better K-12 performance and graduation rates, and better health.
In 1999, Janklow estimated 12,000 children would benefit from state-sponsored preschool. Looking at average enrollment for each K-12 grade in South Dakota schools, it’s likely that number would be the same today. Since 90% of brain development occurs in the first five years, early childhood development is one of the best investments societies can make. For every dollar invested in preschool, the return is anywhere from 7% to 20%.
Since 2023, the John T. Vucurevich Foundation has invested nearly $6 million in early learning initiatives in Rapid City — from child care assistance to afterschool programs.
We encourage our leaders to look at the state’s incarceration issue upstream. Because, as Janklow wrote in his 1999 letter, “our children’s good beginnings are our good future.”
“In my opinion, we can’t wait any longer.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-09 13:40:04+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Amid severe weather, Massachusetts must invest in protecting nature for all","David O'Neill, Kris Sarri, Katie Theoharides and Jodi Valenta",,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/amid-severe-weather-massachusetts-must-invest-in-protecting-nature-for-all/,"Trees, parks, and green spaces are not just nice to have—they are critical, low-cost infrastructure that provide nature-based solutions to bolster climate resilience.","MASSACHUSETTS IS IN a new era of severe weather and damaging storms. Flash floods in Leominster and the Berkshires, extreme heat in Boston, rising sea levels along the coast, and prolonged droughts are no longer rare events—they are our new reality. And their impacts are not felt equally. To protect all Massachusetts residents from these impacts of climate change — regardless of ZIP code— we must do more as a state to protect our rivers, lakes, forests, farms, and other natural areas.
That is why the Nature for Massachusetts Coalition, representing more than 95 conservation, environmental justice, and community organizations, along with members of the outdoor industry, are urging the Legislature to pass the Nature for All bill (H 901/S 2571) this session.
The Nature for All bill, which would dedicate funds from the existing state sales tax on sporting goods to raise $100 million every year for protecting and conserving water and nature, is our coalition’s top priority. While a parallel ballot initiative reflects growing public support, the fastest and most effective path forward is legislative action. The bill is the perfect complement to the climate resiliency investments proposed by the Healey administration in their MassReady Act. We urge lawmakers: don’t wait.
Trees, parks, and green spaces are not just nice to have—they are critical, low-cost infrastructure that provide nature-based solutions to bolster climate resilience. They cool our cities, absorb stormwater, and improve public health and access to safe drinking water. But access is unequal, and without a coordinated approach, the gap will only grow.  
The Nature for All bill would help level the playing field by identifying communities most in need of green space and climate resilience and supporting them with state funding to protect and restore that green space. It would enable smart investments in parks, greenways, and nature-based solutions all across the state, with community input at the center.
Climate resiliency isn’t the only issue this legislation addresses. It also will improve access to parks and green space. More than 1.5 million people in Massachusetts—including 300,000 children—lack access to a park or natural area within a 10-minute walk of home. These are often the same neighborhoods facing the worst effects of severe weather: heat islands, flood risk, and polluted runoff.
We’ve already seen efforts to change this work in practice.
In Boston, Trust for Public Land, Boston Parks and Recreation Department, and Boston Public Schools partnered with students at the Chittick Elementary School in Hyde Park and residents of the surrounding community to redesign a deteriorating and flood-prone schoolyard. Using green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, it was transformed into a renovated, safe, climate-resilient schoolyard and public park that mitigates the heat island effect and manages stormwater runoff, while closing a gap in park access for surrounding neighborhoods.
In Chelsea, GreenRoots, The Neighborhood Developers, and Mass Audubon are working together to acquire 18 acres of waterfront property and transform it into a broadly accessible, climate-resilient park, mixed-income housing, and community amenities along the Chelsea Creek waterfront. 
The Nature Conservancy is helping coastal communities adapt to climate change. With Massachusetts ranking third nationally in affordable housing at risk from coastal flooding, every dollar spent on climate resilience counts and can reduce future damages, protect people, and cut carbon emissions.
North of Boston, The Trustees is restoring thousands of acres of salt marsh in the Great Marsh, along the coast in Essex County. Along with numerous partners, The Trustees is remediating the marshland to help it adapt to sea level rise and bolster its ability to store carbon. This will help reduce storm surge and flood risk to uplands while also enhancing habitat for several wildlife species that rely on the marsh, including the saltmarsh sparrow.
The Nature for All bill builds upon these successes—and brings statewide coordination, resources, and urgency to address these dire needs.
The climate crisis demands more than reactive measures—it calls for bold action. That is why state Sen. Paul Feeney and state Reps. Natalie Blais and Samantha Montaño are leading the sponsorship of the bill, joined by bipartisan support from 52 members of the Legislature.
Managing the impacts of climate change is interconnected with the Commonwealth’s goals for health care, housing, food security, climate change, and land and water conservation. These efforts should be integrated and aligned to avoid conflicts and enable progress. Passing the Nature for All bill now will reduce harm from extreme heat and flooding; improve health and quality of life, create more resilient communities, and ensure every resident—no matter their ZIP code—has access to the joy and benefits of nature.
Massachusetts has been an environmental leader before. We built the nation’s first public park, and our forests, beaches, and parks are part of what makes Massachusetts a great place to live.
The cost of inaction is increasing. Let’s lead again—by investing in nature and protecting those most at risk from extreme weather.

Zella Knight is a fire survivor and community advocate from Altadena


By the time my parents made a home in Altadena, they had already survived the Jim Crow South.  They had carried with them an understanding that for Black families, safety, property and opportunity are never guaranteed.
Homeownership for them was not simply a personal achievement; it was an act of repair.  It was a way of claiming dignity in a country that had long denied Black families the right to build, keep and pass down stability.
Our home stood for decades. It held birthdays and celebrations of life, holidays and ordinary moments of care. It was a gathering place for family and neighbors, a refuge from a world that still too often devalues Black and Brown Life.  It was meant to be an inheritance — a rare form of generational wealth in a nation where Black families have been systematically excluded from wealth-building opportunities.
Then came the Eaton fire. In a single catastrophic event, the house was destroyed.  
The most devastating loss was not material. My younger brother, who lived there, through displacement was traumatized and later died. His life and the future my parents worked to secure for him and his siblings was taken from us.
Disasters are often described as equalizers.  Fires, floods and wind do not discriminate.  But that framing ignores history.  It ignores how racial injustice shapes vulnerability, loss and recovery long before disaster strikes.  
For Black and Brown families, catastrophe does not arrive on neutral ground.
Property loss in Black and Brown communities has never been accidental. From redlining and racial covenants, gentrification and discriminatory lending, insurance practices and disaster recovery systems — Black homeownership has been consistently undermined.
When a fire destroys a Black family’s home, it compounds generations of dispossession. What is lost is not only a structure, but equity built over decades in a system that never made it easy.  What disappears are irreplaceable records of survival, photographs, documents, heirlooms and too often lives.
The weight of earlier losses
Grief in Black families is rarely singular. It accumulates. It carries the weight of earlier losses that were never fully mourned because survival required moving forward.
The fire reopened wounds my parents carried from the South — the persistent knowledge that even when you do everything “right” safety can still be taken.  
This is why intergenerational healing is not an abstract or academic concept. For families like mine, it is a necessity. Healing begins with truthtelling — naming how racism magnifies disaster, how Black families are more likely to be underinsured, displaced for longer periods and offered fewer recovery resources. It also requires refusing to privatize grief when systemic failures are involved.
My parents believed deeply in community because community was how they survived Jim Crow.  That belief carried us through the aftermath of the fire. 
Neighbors, friends, acquaintances, strangers showed up not just with condolences, but with care. That relational support is a form of wealth rarely acknowledged in policy discussions, yet it is often the difference between despair and survival. 
Still, community resilience cannot substitute for institutional responsibility.
If racial justice is to mean more than rhetoric, it must address what disasters reveal. Why are Black families more likely to lose generational wealth in catastrophes?  Why is recovery slower and more bureaucratic for communities shaped by historic disinvestment? Why are families expected to be endlessly “resilient” without repair?
Intergenerational healing requires policy responses that acknowledge history. It requires equitable disaster aid, fair insurance practices, protections for inherited property, culturally competent mental health services and reimagining programs so they don’t displace families from communities they helped build. 
The Eaton Fire took a home. Displacement took a life and shattered dreams. But these did not erase the legacy my parents built — a commitment to dignity, community and truth. 
Intergenerational healing is not forgetting what was taken. It is about refusing to allow that loss to be normalized.
If we want a future where Black and Brown families can truly build and pass down stability, racial justice must extend to how we prepare for, respond to and recover from catastrophe. Anything less ensures that fires like ours will continue to burn through generations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 08:58:31.513534

Stacy Korsgaden
Stacy Korsgaden, who is running for Insurance Commissioner,  owns an  insurance and financial services agency.


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the third response. Read the other candidate responses here and here.
California is facing an insurance crisis that threatens the financial security of families, homeowners, and small businesses across the state. 
Coverage is becoming harder to obtain, premiums are rising, and policy cancellations are increasing. These developments are understandably alarming. But the good news: There is hope.
I have been a licensed insurance professional since 1988, and with close to 40 years of experience I can tell you, insurance is not merely a financial product, it is a promise. It is a cornerstone of economic stability that allows families to recover from tragedy and businesses to survive unforeseen loss. That system has served California well for generations. It can do so again.
Throughout my career as an insurance agent and business owner, my work began long before a claim was ever filed. The most important service we provided was preparation, making sure clients were properly protected before disaster struck. When the unthinkable did occur, being present to guide them through recovery was both a responsibility and a privilege. That is the role insurance is meant to play in society.
So how did we arrive at a moment where insurers are pulling back, denying coverage, or leaving entire markets? The answer is not sudden greed or indifference. It is the result of decades of accumulating regulations, rigid price controls, insufficient wildfire prevention and mitigation, and other unmanaged risk factors that have steadily eroded the system’s stability.
Insurance is fundamentally about pricing risk accurately. When that process is constrained, insurers cannot reliably operate. The result is exactly what Californians are experiencing now: reduced availability, deteriorating service, fewer choices for consumers and escalating prices.
Customers are angry and confused. Agents are left without options for their clients. Insurers face mounting losses. Meanwhile, political finger pointing has replaced serious discussion, and trust in the system continues to erode.
California does not need to choose between consumer protection and a functioning insurance market. We can have both. Achieving that balance requires a recommitment to basic principles: Free markets, actuarial soundness, California managing wildfire risks and allowing private sector innovations.
Insurance thrives on predictability and trust. When those elements are restored, capital returns, coverage expands and our working families benefit from greater choice and better service.
When a functioning free market is restored in California, capital will return and support the growth of insurers willing to serve the state. Renewed competition will naturally reduce dependence on the FAIR Plan and allow for its depopulation.
The FAIR Plan was never intended to insure the many. It was designed as a last resort option for a limited number of high risk properties. Its long-term stability depends on removing the excess burden created by the absence of a competitive private market.
As insurers are once again able to grow and write policies in California, coverage will shift back where it belongs, into the private market, restoring balance and choice for our community.
The insurance industry has long been a quiet but essential pillar of our economy. With truth, discipline, and hard work it can be again. This crisis is fixable.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — This year’s annual King Day at the Dome will feature a first: The flag of South Carolina’s only public historically Black university will fly atop the Statehouse as people gather below to honor Martin Luther King Jr.
The main speaker from the Statehouse steps Jan. 19 will be New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Others include California Rep. Ro Khanna and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison of Columbia, who delivered last year’s keynote speech, according to the NAACP’s state chapter, which organizes the annual event.
Above them, from sunrise to sunset, the flag of South Carolina State University will fly just under the U.S. and state flags. The unfurling officially celebrates the Bulldogs’ 40-38 fourth-overtime victory at last month’s Celebration Bowl, which made them national football champions for historically Black colleges and universities.
The flag-flying honor is definitely a first for South Carolina State, according to the college. It’s believed to be the first time any HBCU flag has flown from the dome.
The timing on MLK Day magnifies the meaning: 26 years ago, the NAACP organized the first King Day at the Dome to protest the Confederate flag flying in the same spot.
Rep. Hamiton Grant called the recognition of his alma mater, by order of GOP Gov. Henry McMaster, a symbol of unity across political differences.
“I think that should send a message to the people of South Carolina that we tend to agree more than we disagree,” the Columbia Democrat told the SC Daily Gazette. “Our history as a school, our history as a people and what we mean to the state, is something everyone should be proud of.”
Grant said college officials requested the Jan. 19 date.
He and Sen. Deon Tedder, also a South Carolina State graduate, will jointly present the flag to the Bulldogs football team in Orangeburg during its celebratory parade days later, Tedder wrote in his Dec. 19 letter to McMaster.

SC State flag request 
“It will be my honor,” McMaster wrote back about having the flag flown on MLK Day.
South Carolina State’s Dec. 13 victory in Atlanta over Prairie View A&M marked the Bulldogs’ second national HBCU championship title and third appearance at the Celebration Bowl in five years. They beat Jackson State 31-10 in 2021 to take the title.
It’s become tradition for a college flag to fly on the dome following a national championship. But lawmakers didn’t make a flag request following the Bulldogs’ 2021 win, Grant said.
Last month’s win, which avenged the Bulldogs’ 28-7 loss to Jackson State a year earlier, was dubbed by HBCU Gameday “one of the most dramatic finishes in HBCU football history.”
“This championship represents more than an athletic triumph; it is a moment of pride for the entire state of South Carolina,” Tedder, D-North Charleston, wrote Dec. 15 in his initial letter to McMaster that didn’t seek a specific date for the flag’s flying. “It celebrates the dedication of student-athletes, coaches, alumni, and supporters whose collective efforts embody excellence, resilience, and unity.”
King Day speakers
This year’s theme for King Day at the Dome is “The Time is Now.”
The event starts at 8 a.m. at Zion Baptist Church on Washington Street. Around 10 a.m., participants will walk the half-mile to the Statehouse for speeches.
Unlike in 2024, when then-Vice President Kamala Harris was the main speaker, there won’t be any metal detectors that people have to walk through. The extra layers of security for her attendance created a bottleneck for the crowd to get from Main Street to the Statehouse lawn.
The event celebrating King’s legacy has become a must-attend event for Democratic presidential candidates courting the support of Black voters in this early primary state.
In 2020, Joe Biden was among eight White House hopefuls marching arm in arm from the church to the Statehouse. They did not include Booker, who was instead at his Columbia campaign office thanking staff after dropping out of the race a week earlier.
This year, Booker will give the keynote address. Last spring, he broke the record for talking the longest on the U.S. Senate floor. His speech, at more than 25 hours, surpassed the 24-hour record set in 1957 by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, then a Democrat, as he filibustered civil rights legislation.
But Booker’s selection is not a sign of any future endorsement, should he decide to run again in 2028.
He’s giving the speech because he was the first person to reach out and ask, said Brenda Murphy, the state NAACP president.
Khanna, who represents a California district in the San Francisco Bay known as Silicon Valley, will also speak. Last July, he was in South Carolina for a four-day swing to rally opposition to the Trump administration. In Goose Creek, his “Benefits Over Billionaires” town hall instead showed Democrats’ frustrations with their own party, The Post and Courier reported.
It’s been over a decade since a Confederate flag flew over the event.
The flag came off the dome six months after the inaugural King Day at the Dome. The 2000 legislative compromise that took it down made both MLK Day and Confederate Memorial Day state holidays. It also put a smaller, square version of the battle flag on a 30-foot pole beside the Confederate monument on the Statehouse’s front lawn. Its prominent place along Columbia’s main thoroughfare made the flag more visible than it had been before.
The NAACP continued to call for the flag’s total removal from Statehouse grounds, and speakers pointed to the flag during the annual event.
But lawmakers refused to revisit the issue until 2015, after an avowed white supremacist gunned down nine people at Charleston’s historic Emanual African Methodist Episcopal Church, known as Mother Emanuel. Less than a month after the shooting, the flag and the pole it flew on were taken down. The law passed by the Legislature to do so sent the flag to a state museum.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Statehouse-dome-with-flags-1024x632.jpg,,,2026-01-09 09:12:13.687278
,California,2026-01-09 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom touts billions in new revenue but skips his own budget release,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/california-newsom-last-state-budget/,"The governor made rosy projections and dropped big revenue numbers in his speech Thursday. Here’s what he said, and didn’t say, about California’s fiscal future.","In summary
The governor made rosy projections and dropped big revenue numbers in his speech Thursday. Here’s what he said, and didn’t say, about California’s fiscal future.


Gov. Gavin Newsom painted a rosy picture of California’s fiscal future during his State of the State address Thursday. Flashing top-line numbers, the Democratic governor touted billions of  dollars more in revenue, proposed new investments in education and pledged more toward the state’s reserves and pension debt.
But that was a one-sided story. 
It’s not clear whether Newsom will forecast a budget deficit for the 2026-27 fiscal year, how big it will be and whether closing the gap would require painful spending cuts to core services like child care, food assistance and Medi-Cal, the state’s health care coverage for low-income residents, especially as federal funding diminishes. 
Yet Newsom will be absent from his last annual budget proposal presentation Friday, when details of his spending plan will be unveiled, leaving his Department of Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw and Chief Deputy Director of Budgets Erika Li to field those questions.
Newsom’s forecast will likely be far sunnier than the grim outlook by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, which in November projected an $18 billion deficit despite higher-than-expected tax revenue thanks to a booming AI industry. A shortfall of that size would require long-term fixes, although state leaders had relied on Band-Aids such as accounting maneuvers, internal borrowing and withdrawals from the state’s reserves to balance the books in past years.
But according to Newsom, California will have a $248.3 billion general fund next year — $13 billion higher  than his office predicted in June. 
Newsom also touted Thursday that the state would have $42.3 billion more in revenue than forecast last year. But that figure is for a three-year span, state Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer told CalMatters. 
The omission of the cumulative nature of the $42 billion makes Newsom’s speech “troubling,” said Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican and vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee.
“That would be an intentional misrepresentation of the fact,” he said.
Nonetheless, Newsom teased multiple new proposals with unknown price tags or timelines, such as fully funding the state’s universal transitional kindergarten program and providing universal before and after-school programs at elementary schools. He also proposed spending $1 billion to add high-need community schools and redirecting $1 billion in Proposition 1 mental health funds annually for housing and homelessness.
The governor briefly nodded to “long-term structural challenges,” proposing a $7.3 billion deposit to the reserve fund, roughly the amount the state withdrew last year, whichwould bring the rainy day fund balance to roughly $21 billion. He also proposed to spend $11.8 billion over the next few years to pay down the state’s pension debt, including $3 billion in next year’s budget. 
Some Democratic lawmakers struck a cautious tone while largely blaming President Donald Trump for withholding funds from Californians in need. 
“California will not be able to fill the holes that have been left by the federal government,” said newly elected Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat. “We have to go back and look (at) what is feasible.”
‘How big is the bubble?’Senate Budget Committee Chair John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat
Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat and the new chair of the Senate Budget Committee, warned that the high revenue projection indicates a bubble. Laird, who was elected to the state Assembly in 2002 after the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, said he’s concerned the AI-driven boom may not last. 
“I think everybody agrees that this level of revenue can’t be maintained, but how big is the bubble? That’s probably the question,” he told CalMatters.
The Legislature must start chipping away at the long-term structural deficit this year instead of punting the problem, he said.
“We’re gonna have to do a piece of it,” he said. “We can’t go into next year with a $30 or $37 billion shortfall, because the reserves amount doesn’t get anywhere near that.” 
Continued fight over homelessness funding
Newsom has tussled with counties over homelessness funding for years as political pressure to resolve the state’s homeless crisis continues to mount. Newsom has blamed counties for failing to deliver results despite his $24 billion investment over the years. Only a portion of the funding goes to county agencies and there is no dedicated annual funding to fight homelessness.
On Thursday, Newsom again bashed counties for the problem while attributing a drop in unsheltered homeless people last year to his statewide programs. In the same breath, he also proposed to redirect “$1 billion in annual mental health funding to housing and treatment for people living on the streets” under Proposition 1, a voter-approved bond primarily for mental health beds and supportive housing.
“No more excuses — it’s time to bring people off the streets, out of encampments, into housing, into treatment. Counties need to do their job!” Newsom said, drawing applause from legislators.
It wasn’t immediately clear how he plans to allocate those dollars. He did not mention any funding for the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, the state’s main homelessness funding source. 
The California State Association of Counties, which represents all 58 counties and has lobbied for an annual allocation of $1 billion in HHAP funding, was displeased.
“Playing a shell game with existing funds is no substitute for the most successful program addressing homelessness at the local level,” said association CEO Graham Knaus. “Why on Earth would the state abdicate its responsibility and allow homelessness to soar again?”
Newsom’s plan also startled county behavioral health service providers, who rely on Prop. 1 dollars for services. 
“While these one-time bricks and mortar investments are promising, the $1 billion in funding for ongoing housing subsidies under Proposition 1 comes at the expense of redirected mental health treatment and prevention programs,” said Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the County Behavioral Health Directors Association.
No mention of Medi-Cal
Newsom also gave next to no detail on the outlook for Medi-Cal — the state’s most expensive program with a $200 billion budget and therefore an attractive target for potential cuts. He didn’t even name the program in his speech.
The governor slammed Trump for passing a federal budget that could kick 1.8 million Californians off their insurance and raise the premiums for another 2 million. The state would have to spend at least $1.3 billion more than previously expected next year just to implement the federal law, the LAO previously estimated.

Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, said the state must “use the bully pulpit” to fight the federal government, find ways to lower costs or even revive indigent care, a form of last-resort care that has largely become obsolete due to Medi-Cal. 
“Because the alternative is, people are going to be dying on the streets,” Bonta said.
Bonta said the Legislature should explore new funding sources, such as a pair of proposed wealth tax ballot measures to fund health care and education that Newsom opposes.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Much of the third day of the trial of former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. consisted of testimony from the former welfare agency employee who drafted the first memos about the alleged scheme to misuse welfare money that was supposed to help needy Mississippians.
Mississippi Department of Human Services Inspector General David Barton’s colleagues in budgets and accounting had found a peculiar address on an invoice and brought it to Barton in 2019.  The retired Mississippi National Guard colonel took a closer look and quickly made some alarming discoveries. 
DiBiase had appeared to be an employee of the Mississippi Department of Human Services. He had an office on the executive floor and accompanied the agency director at the time, John Davis, to most meetings. Barton assumed DiBiase was being paid for his time, but he couldn’t find any payment from the agency to the wrestler.
Ted DiBiase Jr. speaks at the governor’s Healthy Teens Rally in 2018.
Starting with Barton’s tip, investigators eventually unraveled how the Mississippi Department of Human Services had pushed tens of millions of federal welfare dollars to two nonprofits through subgrants, which were then used by various people as a vehicle to skirt federal regulations. 
DiBiase received $3.1 million from the nonprofits, auditors found, with funding coming from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and The Emergency Food Assistance Program. The federal government alleges this was embezzlement, while DiBiase asserts he was a lawful contractor.
Testimony Thursday from U.S. Department of Agriculture branch chief Polly Fairfield revealed that in 2018, the year DiBiase received nearly $500,000 from the emergency food program, the entire state of Mississippi received $1.2 million to administer the program. 
Fairfield explained that through the program, the federal government supplies food – fruits, vegetables, beans, meat, dairy, grains – to states, plus administrative money to pay for the storage and distribution of those goods to needy residents. 
DiBiase’s contract represents nearly half of the state’s entire administrative resources for the program that year. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie said the primary evidence of DiBiase’s work under that contract was a list of food pantries DiBiase compiled – “essentially a Google search.” 
This was all possible, Barton’s testimony demonstrated, because of a widespread breakdown of controls at the agency. Davis was appointed in 2016 by former Gov. Phil Bryant and was allowed to unilaterally choose who would receive subgrants and move money around with the ease of a text message.

It’s not unusual for state welfare departments to send federal grant funds to nonprofits to provide services to satisfy the goals of a program. But Mississippi barely monitored these nonprofits, even failing to maintain a list of entities it had awarded funds, the auditor’s office claimed.
If a nonprofit subgrantee wanted to outsource some of the services it promised to provide, it wasn’t required to tell the welfare agency who it contracted with and for what. Barton said he and his colleagues revised the agency’s subgrant manual to change this during Davis’ departure in 2019.
Barton joined the Mississippi Department of Human Services in 2017 shortly after the launch of the internal audit division, a new department prompted by legislation. He said one of his first tasks was to gather and build a repository for past agency audits. 
The problems predated Davis becoming director: Barton said in 2015, the agency’s audit found a significant deficiency in how it monitored subgrants. In 2016, the finding worsened to noncompliance. This repeated in 2017 and 2018.
“Did you find it frustrating,” DiBiase’s defense lawyer Sidney Lampton asked Barton, “when there would be a corrective action plan from DHS about how they were going to fix or improve, and then the very next year, the audit would say, ‘Y’all did the very same thing you did last year.’”
Change would eventually come, but only after Barton’s memo.
In October of 2018, under Davis’ leadership, the agency created an Office of Inspector General, which Barton led. Prior to this, a tip like a mysterious address on an invoice would have gone to a different division that Barton said did not have the ability to do the kind of investigation he did.
Barton’s first June 2019 memo was not primarily about DiBiase, but his brother Brett DiBiase, who also worked for Davis. The brother, another former wrestler, had contracted with the welfare agency to provide addiction education courses to state employees, but on his invoices to the agency, he suspiciously listed his company’s address as Davis’ post office box. Investigators later found Brett DiBiase was in rehab in California during the time he was supposed to be performing the contract.
After this discovery, Davis was quickly pushed out of MDHS. Bryant called the departure a retirement and praised Davis as someone who “dedicated his life to serving others.”
Once this information reached the auditor’s office, Barton said an agent there asked him to continue compiling what he could about what Davis was doing with the wrestlers.

The second memo discussed Teddy DiBiase’s leadership training program called “Law of 16,” which the government described in its opening statement as a self-help curriculum “copied from a number of sources.” Barton described the presentations, sometimes elaborate events with linen tablecloths, table arrangements and a performance by a gospel choir, in his memo as an “interactive praise/preaching type environment.” 
Davis rewarded DHS employees who attended the wrestler’s talks with days off – which is not allowed under state rules, Barton said. One of these trainings consisted of attendees watching the action film “Marine 2” produced by WWE’s film division and starring DiBiase.
MDHS also purchased polo shirts and Patagonia jackets branded with the “Law of 16” logo.
Days before Barton’s tip led to Davis’ ouster, DiBiase accompanied the welfare director to testify about Mississippi’s safety-net model before Congress. Davis described “Law of 16” during his testimony as “our personal and professional development programs” he hoped to bring to welfare recipients “to make sure that they are empowered to be whom they have been called to be.”

Liban Mohamed’s campaign announcement video posted to X on Monday has since gained more than 2.2 million views. But many of the online responses to the video on the social media platform drew condemnation from the leadership of the Utah Democratic Party. 
“We take no position on Democratic nominees for CD1,” the Utah Democratic Party said in a post about Mohamed’s campaign video. However, it added: “The flood of racist and religious hate directed at Liban Mohamed is disgusting. Let’s be clear where it’s coming from: the racism and white fragility on display from Republicans across this state is dangerous and embarrassing.”

Many of the online responses to the video called for Mohamed to be deported. But Mohamed is a U.S citizen. He was born in Logan and raised in Ogden. His parents are Somali immigrants, who he said came to Utah in the ’80s to attend Utah State University during a time when the civil war in Somalia broke out. While they continued their education, they decided to stay and raise their family in Utah. 
“Utah was a place that treated them so well. A place that educated them. A place that accepted them. So they settled down here, they had their kids. So I was born here,” Mohamed told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Thursday. 
Mohamed, 27, is Black and Muslim, and he currently lives in Salt Lake City. He decided to launch a bid for Congress after he said some leaders from the Black and Muslim communities encouraged him to run. He said he felt a “moral obligation to step up and try my best to fulfill that calling.” 
In the days since his campaign announcement, Mohamed said he’s been focused on the positive response both on and offline — from the “people from communities that are entirely different from myself flocking in my defense.” 
He said his phone has “blown up” with messages from people asking how they can volunteer and support his campaign, “that they feel like I can be that person that re-instills their hope.” 
“When I saw all of this, I teared up, honestly,” he said. “Because my dream of what I could be has already begun to unfold (from) a single post. So I hope that I can live up to those expectations and be that person the community is yearning for.” 
Mohamed said he’s intent on focusing on real-world issues — like bringing down costs for housing, child care and health care — rather than the online vitriol.
“Hate is an opportunity to educate and unite, and we will find beauty behind the madness,” he said. “I think this virality is an example of our ability to galvanize the community.” 
Mohamed said he hopes the focus isn’t on the “horrible rhetoric I was facing, but the beautiful defense that thousands came behind me with.” 










Hate is an opportunity to educate and unite, and we will find beauty behind the madness.


– Liban Mohamed


Mohamed joins at least five other Democrats who have announced bids for Utah’s new 1st Congressional District, which under a court-ordered map is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake City, and is projected to lean heavily Democratic. 
Other declared Democratic candidates include Salt Lake City Council member Eva Lopez Chavez, state Sen. Kathleen Riebe, state Sen. Nate Blouin, former state Sen. Derek Kitchen, and Utah’s last Democratic congressman, former Rep. Ben McAdams. 
Most recently, Mohamed worked on TikTok’s public policy team, managing the company’s response to political investigations — a role he said he has resigned from in order to run for Congress. He also previously worked for Meta, where he focused on data center sustainability policies, and as a government relations director at the American Heart Association in Utah. 
He said he hopes to take his expertise in tech — and his perspective as a young American — to Congress to represent younger generations and act as “somebody who can work across the aisle while simultaneously holding true to their progressive values and their principles.” 
While many of the responses to his campaign announcement were “vile and instilled fear into our communities,” Mohamed said he also understands that people who use bigoted or racist rhetoric around immigration issues are often scared or frustrated with the same economic problems he wants to help tackle.

Anger and blame placed on immigrants, Mohamed said, “are coming from a place of struggle. There is a reality behind those frustrations, and that reality is what I want to fight for, which is making our community a community that has economic stability.” 
“We’re going to make this campaign a campaign about positivity, a campaign about policy, and fighting for the frustrations that are at the root of all of these different concerns, which are people’s pocketbooks,” he said. 
“But the pocketbooks are not being hurt because of immigrants or minorities,” Mohamed added. “Their pocketbooks are being hurt because they’re being exploited by the wealthy. They’re being paid low wages, because affording a roof over your head is becoming increasingly difficult. Because they’re one hospital trip away from bankruptcy. Because raising a family is harder than ever.” 
So, Mohamed said he’s going to “focus on the real fundamental issues that I believe are the underlying motive behind these frustrations, and not focus on the bigotry and all of the rhetoric that is nothing but a distraction.” 
Mohamed’s campaign announcement also came at a time when President Donald Trump has taken aim at Somali immigrants. Immigration enforcement agents increased their presence in Minnesota in recent weeks as part of a targeted campaign ordered by Trump to deport undocumented Somali immigrants.  
Report: ICE headed to Twin Cities targeting Somali immigrants

Additionally, earlier this month the Trump administration said states would need to provide “justification” proving that federal child care funds are being spent on “legitimate” entities. The comments followed fraud allegations in Minnesota related to the state’s child care programs, which were already being investigated by state and federal agencies but blew up following a YouTube video by a right-wing social media influencer. The allegations particularly targeted child care centers run by Somali citizens of the state.
Mohamed called the intersection of his campaign announcement and Trump’s rhetoric surrounding Somali immigrants a “matter of coincidence.” He said he decided to enter the race before Trump’s comments against Somali immigrants began ramping up.
While Mohamed said one part of the root of frustrations against immigrants can be traced to resource scarcity — leading people to think they have to “push out” immigrants — he said another part of the problem is the “permissive structure that Donald Trump and the MAGA movement has provided for people to feel so emboldened to openly be so vile.” 
“So I hope that the 2026 and 2028 (election) cycles put the cap on that permission structure so that people know that they have to be careful with their words and respect and love your neighbors,” he said.

Albritton has held legal services contracts for a second straight month over a lawsuit regarding the simplified sellers use tax. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama legislator Thursday extended a delay of state agencies’ legal services contracts in protest of a lawsuit filed by several cities seeking changes to distributions of the state’s Internet sales tax.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, held six legal contracts totaling more than $1 million at Thursday’s Contract Review Committee meeting as the lawsuit against the levy, known as the Simplified Sellers Use Tax (SSUT), works its way through the court.
“We are now stuck and waiting to figure out what lawyers are going to come in and make a comment or try to deal with how the Legislature should handle public funds, who it should be going to and how it should be distributed,” Albritton said at the meeting. “That is the Legislature’s job. That is our constitutional responsibility. It has no role in the judicial matter at all.”
The move by Albritton, who also blocked the contracts at December’s Contract Review Committee, drew strong criticism from Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, who defended the actions of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The city of Tuscaloosa, parts of which are in England’s district, is part of the lawsuit.
“The distribution of funds from the SSUT creates a unique issue for municipalities and counties across the state,” England said. “As more people buy things online, it reduces the amount that you take in from brick-and-mortar sales, which, by the way, they get more from brick-and-mortar sales than from online sales.”
The dispute came a few hours after the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA), which opposes the lawsuit, said that county law enforcement agencies could lose millions of dollars in funding should the cities prevail.
“County governments will spend almost $1 billion in providing funding to protect the citizens through the provision of law enforcement services in our state, almost a billion dollars,” said Sonny Brasfield, executive director of the ACCA, at a press conference in Montgomery Thursday. “During this current budget year, counties will receive about $200 million from SSUT, that money is essential in our ability to continue to provide the revenue that is necessary to protect our citizens.”
Before the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair in 2018, local taxing authorities such as cities and counties could only collect revenues from sales taxes on businesses located within their respective boundaries. The Wayfair decision allowed taxing jurisdictions to collect taxes on sales through the Internet.
Cities filed a lawsuit in August to challenge the simplified sellers use tax, alleging that it violates Alabama’s constitution and that some of the retailers that the Alabama Department of Revenue approved of should be disqualified and instead pay the traditional local sales tax of 10%, not the reduced 8% they currently pay.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit want the Alabama Department of Revenue to remove several companies from the program that they believe are ineligible for SSUT because they have a significant presence in the state.
Lawmakers modified the program to place more stringent eligibility requirements for retailers to qualify for the reduced tax rate in SSUT, but the city of Tuscaloosa stated in its lawsuit that it is forfeiting $14.6 million in tax revenues because of the differences in the tax rate that businesses are eligible for because of SSUT.
England said during the meeting that local schools lose money because sales taxes from the growing volume of online purchases are distributed differently than the sales taxes obtained through brick-and-mortar transactions. England also accused the Alabama Department of Revenue, the agency responsible for overseeing SSUT, of allowing some retailers to collect taxes from transactions through SSUT that are local and should be part of the traditional sales taxes which can be allocated directly to local schools.
“Apparently, the Department of Revenue decided that any online transaction, even the ones that were not intended to be, like for example, if you order something from Walmart that is delivered to your house and you bought it from there, that is not a simplified sellers use transaction,” England said.
A spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Revenue declined comment on Thursday, saying the department does not comment on pending litigation.
Albritton said that smaller, rural areas are subsidizing more urban centers because customers will purchase items in stores located in places such as Mobile because they live in Chatom, for example, that has few retailers. SSUT, he argued, helps balance out the revenue.
Law enforcement
Each county allocates a different amount of its share of SSUT money to law enforcement and it is not clear how much of it goes to law enforcement. But all counties set aside a significant amount to public safety, according to Brasfield.
“In about 55 of the 67 counties, law enforcement is at least half of the counties’ budget,” Brasfield said. “That means the money is going to law enforcement everywhere. In rural Alabama, a much higher percentage of the money is going to law enforcement than in other counties.”
Doug Singleton, chair of the Montgomery County Commission, and Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham also attended the news conference to punctuate the point.
“It is about 12 to 15 deputies,” Singleton said about the impact of the lawsuit on law enforcement for Montgomery County.
The Association of the County Commissions of Alabama had been warning counties of the potential implications of the lawsuit throughout the year. The case is currently in mediation.
A message was sent to the city of Montgomery and the Alabama Education Association, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, on Thursday.
City of Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said in a statement on Thursday that, “The people of Alabama are entitled to a system that is legal and fair, and one that ensures local sales taxes generated in a community remain in that community to support schools, public safety, and overall quality of life.”
He also said that, “Today, millions of Alabamians are experiencing fewer teachers, fewer police officers, fewer firefighters, fewer road projects, and less economic development as a direct result of SSUT’s legal flaws.”
Steve Boone, city manager for the city of Mountain Brook, said that the current way that the Simplified Sellers Use Tax is structured to reduce the tax collections that urban centers such as his city could collect.
“If larger, urban areas are not collecting what they would otherwise get, then that means somebody else is receiving more than what they would normally get,” Boone said in an interview on Thursday.
Boone said Mountain Brook also uses revenue received by the city from the Simplified Sellers Use Tax to fund law enforcement. The money is part of the general fund for Mountain Brook, which is then allocated to various departments, including law enforcement.
Boone also said that the city recently increased its sales tax by 1% because of shortfalls in the budget.
“If we were collecting what we should be collecting from the SSUT … it could have avoided, perhaps, some percentage of our sales tax increase that we needed,” Boone said. “Our costs go up every year. And that is a constant struggle for all cities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Greg-Albritton-May-6-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 08:12:29.712853

(Clark County video screengrab)The prospect of purchasing a brand new 2,000-square-foot single-family home in the northwest part of the Las Vegas Valley for around $300,000 would be scoffed at by local realtors. But the opportunity to do just that is coming later this year, thanks to a new program spearheaded by Clark County.
Last month, the county broke ground on a 30-home development dubbed Rebecca Place, located on Rebecca Road and Tropical Parkway, just outside of Centennial Hills in the northwest part of the Las Vegas metro area .
The 30 homes will be sold to local, first-time homebuyers earning between 80% and 100% of area median income. That currently equates to between $68,000 and $85,000 per year for a family of three.
So, what’s the catch?
Rebecca Place is part of a county-managed community land trust (CLT) designed to keep homes attainably priced in perpetuity.
It works like this: The homebuyer acquires a mortgage for the physical home but enters into a long-term renewable ground lease with the CLT. Removing the land from the equation keeps the sale price lower for the buyer, but it comes with a commitment that, when they eventually sell, the home will again be sold at a below-market rate, using the same formula used for the initial sale.
CLTs and other shared-equity models of homeownership aren’t new, but they are more often managed by a nonprofit rather than a public entity.
Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick believes it’s the first community land trust managed by a local government in the Western United States, if not the country.
“We looked across the country,” she said. “There’s a lot of private land trusts, but there really wasn’t any local governments.”
Kirkpatrick, a former state legislator, said the Nevada State Legislature has previously pondered investing in land trusts but nothing has come of it, so the county decided it could be a leader on the issue.
According to the Las Vegas Realtors, the median sale price for existing single-family homes in Southern Nevada in November was $488,995. The median price for condos and townhomes was $303,750.

The Rebecca Place homes — there are a few model types available — will be priced using a formula that takes into account the buyers’ incomes and expected to be in the low $300,000s.
“That is what many of the homes in that neighborhood sold for six, seven years ago,” said Kirkpatrick.
The homes are designed to fit into the surrounding neighborhood, so they have similar sized lots (most over 8,000 square feet), between 1,900 to 2,100 square feet of living space, and three-car garages.
All of those choices were intentional, says Kirkpatrick. The average home in the area has four or five cars. They are meant for families to grow and age in.
“We really took a lot of kid-gloves looking at it,” she added. “What made sense for the neighborhood? What makes sense for a future homebuyer? And really, for me, I’d personally just like it to be someone’s forever home. I hope they move in and never want to move out.”
According to Kirkpatrick, 800 people have already joined a waiting list to be notified about the Rebecca Place homes.
“Honestly, we haven’t really even advertised it yet,” she added. “So, that was all done through word of mouth…”
Prospective buyers, who will be subject to credit requirements, will eventually be entered into a lottery later this year.
In the meantime, the county is holding orientations to answer questions and emphasize how CLTs work.
Kirkpatrick stressed that people need to understand that shared-equity housing is vastly different from the unfettered, private real estate market. It is not designed for flippers, landlords or others who want to cash in the valley’s history of rising home prices.
“It’s intended to be attainable housing for the long term,” she said. “It’s intended to give (homeowners) a modest equity amount they can take and use for their next home for downpayment assistance. But it’s not, and should never be, intended to be a windfall for anybody.”
Kirkpatrick said the goal is for families to be moving into Rebecca Place by the last quarter of 2026.
She hopes between now and then the county can also break ground on other CLT developments, including one 200-unit development in the southwest that’s already been approved and is “moving through the process.” That project, called Cactus Trails, involved the county purchasing land for $1 an acre from the federal Bureau of Land Management.
“It’s not out of sight that we can do 500, 600 a year,” she said of the potential to scale up. Reaching that would likely require some financial investment.
Beyond the land, which the county already owned, the Rebecca Place homes may be subsidized by the county. If the cost to develop a CLT home is $370,000 but the attainable price is $320,000, the buyer’s mortgage would cover the latter amount and the county would cover the difference through a second silent mortgage.
The county will also offer downpayment assistance to help residents with upfront costs.
Kirkpatrick argues it’s a small investment considering what the county pays in rental assistance and other housing initiatives.
“I hope that we can move to where there’s no subsidies, except maybe for the permits and land, but today I’m prepared, I think it’s a good use of our dollars,” she added.
“There are always a few people that say the government shouldn’t be in the business. Well, I’m in the business one way or another. Might as well try to give people an opportunity to own a home.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/marylincropped-1024x598.jpg,,,2026-01-09 08:12:29.712853

Board members were originally supposed to vote on recommendations for social studies and arts education textbooks made by two separate committees —  one for social studies and one for arts — during the board’s  meeting last November.
The two committees, were appointed in April to review and rate textbooks. Those ratings were then sealed and given to the board in October.
The vote was delayed because of concerns raised by board members about the social studies textbooks recommended. Some board members raised questions about the short timeframe to review the textbooks, while some also expressed concerns the books might not reflect what they consider the values of Alabamians.
Mackey told board members during this month’s work session that he has created a new proposal that should be presented next month.
“I’m going to get with [Marie] Manning and [Kelley] Mooney next week and go through my proposal. If they say ‘you are absolutely crazy, go rewrite this’ then it might be March,” he said.
Mackey did not mention what his new proposal included, but did say there are “enough options” to present to the board in February with hopes to further the process.

Sept. 17, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceA Michigan court has ruled that the state’s plan to overhaul its mental health service delivery system violates state law, citing conflicts with the Michigan Mental Health Code. 
The decision, issued Thursday by Judge Christopher P. Yates of the Michigan Court of Claims, declared that the state’s 2025 request for proposal for a competitive procurement system restricts Community Mental Health Service Programs, which serve as the state’s prepaid inpatient mental health plan providers, from fulfilling their statutory obligations.
While the court denied the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, it stopped short of issuing an injunction to halt the transition process, instead ordering the state to address the legal conflicts identified in the ruling and bring the proposal into compliance with Michigan law. The court emphasized that sufficient Medicaid funds must be allocated to providers to allow them to perform their statutory duties.
The case stems from lawsuits filed by multiple inpatient providers and counties against the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget. The plaintiffs argued that the proposal, which aims to transition to a competitive procurement system by reducing from 10 to three the number of regions that prepaid inpatient health plans operate in, would impair their ability to provide mandated mental health services.
The proposal involves up to $6 billion in state-administered funding and is set to take effect in October 2026. 
In his ruling, Yates stated that the proposal would stop inpatient mental health plan providers from making contracts with service providers, even though those contracts are necessary to pay for services and to manage mental health care properly.
As those providers are required by law to offer many essential services, including crisis care, screening before hospital admission, protecting patients’ rights, and mental health advocacy, Yates ruled that the proposal conflicts with Michigan law, which requires community mental health agencies to coordinate care and protect patients’ rights by working through contracts with service providers.
Thursday’s ruling is not final and does not resolve all pending claims in the case, with Yates indicating that the court would consider injunctive relief if the state fails to address the legal issues raised in the ruling.

Every four years, people will come up with these bad ideas and try to advance them. It is hard to get positive movement on bills that make common sense for reforms.”

The ACLU of Alabama hosted a media briefing on Tuesday to discuss its legislative priorities for the coming session. Among them is HB 54, sponsored by Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, which would allow women who are pregnant while incarcerated to remain on probation for several weeks after giving birth.
“There’s so much data about the immediate connection and what that does to the newborn in its first moments,” said A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director for the ACLU of Alabama, at the briefing. “Practically speaking, the mother needs time to rest and recuperate, so why send her back to a facility that has a known history of harming people, of people dying?”
The legislation states women must inform staff working in the jail that they are pregnant during the medical screening process and that they are tested for pregnancy as part of the screening process unless they decline to be tested.
HB 54 would require bail to be granted to pregnant women so long as the court determines they are not a threat to themselves or to the public.
“The court shall allow a pregnant woman to be supervised on a pre-incarceration term of probation for the length of her pregnancy and for 12 weeks after the birth of her child,” the bill states.
Hollis introduced the bill in the 2024 and 2025 sessions, but it did not come to a vote. Several lawmakers, particularly Republicans, expressed concerns that the bill would allow women who became pregnant to avoid incarceration.
“It is important to remember that, the 12 weeks postpartum, that is essentially going to be considered a probation period,” Robinson said. “The mother is still going to have to check in. Her motions are still going to be monitored. It is not people trying to avoid incarceration, it is really a delay in our opinion.”
Robinson also said that the legislation establishes additional penalties women fail to report to the facility where they are incarcerated on top of the original convictions or charges.
Nearly all the criminal justice reform groups also support legislation that limits the death penalty. Two were filed by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. One is HB 76, a constitutional amendment to abolish capital punishment in the state. A second bill, HB 70, would allow those who were sentenced to death by a judge over a jury’s recommendation of life without parole to pursue resentencing. This would apply to more than two dozen people currently on Alabama’s death row.
“It may be a bit of a tough lift, but it is a common sense policy,” Wakely said. “We should not have a different set of people sitting on death row when a jury pretty clearly found they did not deserve to die.”
Groups also expressed support for reforms to parole. HB 86, also from England, would give weighted consideration to parole applicants who tried to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated.
“Ultimately, it would create a more systematic, transparent, danger to public safety approach,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, in an interview on Tuesday regarding the parole reforms proposed in the legislation.
The groups also wanted to limit the likelihood of people who were granted parole returning to prison.
Alabama Appleseed also plans to support legislation that would preventing people on parole who have shown rehabilitation from returning to prison because of technical violations stemming from their parole or minor infractions.

As a result, the only question that a jury will consider if the case goes to trial is how much the department will pay in damages, Mississippi County Circuit Judge Robert Horack wrote in the order imposing sanctions.
The attorney general’s office, which represented the department, “repeatedly offered excuses ranging from secretarial blame to Dropbox malfunctions and staffing issues,” Horack wrote in Tuesday’s order. “Not a single deadline imposed by the court was met.” 
Along with missed deadlines to produce records, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Smith, the office’s deputy chief counsel for litigation, also failed to appear for scheduled hearings. One hearing he missed was on Oct. 4, when Horack announced he would sanction the department. 
The “deliberate disregard for the authority of this court to enforce its orders” resulted in the sanctions, Horack wrote.
Willa Hynes is suing the department, three of the agency’s corporate contractors and 15 individuals over the death of her son, Jahi Hynes, on April 4, 2021, at the Southeast Correctional Center in Charleston. 
Her attorney, Linda Powers, was not available to comment on Horack’s order.
In a statement to The Independent, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office did not try to deflect blame for Horack’s ruling.
“Sanctions as a result of missing required court hearings are unacceptable and avoidable,” the statement read.
As of Wednesday, Smith is no longer an employee of the office.
The lawsuit alleges corrections officials and contract medical personnel ignored Jahi Hynes’ mental health needs and disregarded department rules for the safety of people in administrative segregation.
Jahi Hynes was placed in administrative segregation on April 3, 2021, after allowing the food port door in his cell to strike the hand of a corrections officer, causing minor injuries, and blocking the port with his mattress. 
The next day, he hanged himself with a bedsheet. 
Jahi Hynes was 27 and serving a 13-year sentence for first degree robbery. 
Horack followed the decision by recusing himself from the case and asking the Missouri Supreme Court to assign a new judge.
The corrections department declined to comment on the sanctions because it does not make statements about litigation, spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Independent.
Hanaway was appointed as attorney general in August after her predecessor, Andrew Bailey, was named co-deputy director of the FBI.  The office has been reorganized to keep better track of cases, the office said, including the creation of a Civil Trials section.
“This change better aligns Attorney General’s Office resources with the needs of state agencies, and will provide the office increased efficiency and coverage.,” the statement read. “Case reassignments are being finalized currently.”
The department has been sanctioned previously for withholding records related to Jahi Hynes’ death. In April 2024, the department was ordered to pay more than $60,000 for knowing violations of the state’s Sunshine Law as it sought to shield records of his death. 
That penalty, $5,000 for the Sunshine Law violation and just over $55,000 for attorney fees, was paid from the state general revenue fund in August 2024.
Hynes’ death is one of more than 750 from the start of 2021 through November, according to records compiled by the Missouri Justice Coalition. The department has been reluctant to release records on the deaths, which reached a record of 139 in 2024.
The highest profile case is the death of Othel Moore on Dec. 8, 2023, in the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Three former corrections officers face criminal charges for assault, with two also charged with second degree murder and the third charged with involuntary manslaughter. Charges against two corrections officers were dropped after they were filed in June 2024.
There are pending wrongful death lawsuits for several other deceased inmates in addition to Hynes.
The discovery violations in the Hynes wrongful death case were numerous and the reasons for delays unconvincing, Horack wrote.
“For nine months following the court’s first hearing on plaintiff’s Motion to Compel on Feb. 11, 2025,” Horack wrote, “considerable deference was afforded to defense counsel and the matter of sanctions remained under advisement for approximately eight months.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-88622652-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 07:13:36.197807

(Getty Images)Indiana lawmakers got an early Christmas surprise back in December — a newly projected tax revenue boost. But that money puts them in a bit of a bind.
Do they let the state surplus rise to $5 billion by the middle of 2027 while also cutting state agency budgets, laying off workers and slashing social service assistance for poor Hoosiers?
It appears so.
“Though the state’s revenue forecast has improved compared to April 2025, it’s not responsible to spend money that hasn’t yet materialized. Senate Republicans will hold the line on major spending proposals, as budget decisions should be made during budget sessions,” the caucus said in a Wednesday news release.
Let’s review how we got here.
The two-year budget process began in December 2024 with a forecast that estimated how much tax revenue was expected to come in over the next two fiscal years. Then, state fiscal leaders spent months crafting a budget that would run from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027.
But just before they finalized the budget in April 2025, an updated forecast showed that much of the new revenue that had been expected wouldn’t materialize.
That forecast process has been used for decades and has generally served the state well. Lawmakers technically always spend money that is expected to come in the future.
New forecast shows big growth in Indiana surplus

It can be confusing, but think of it as if you were told you’d receive a 3% raise next year, so you used that to budget for the year. But, before it took effect, your employer dropped the raise to 1%. You will still receive more pay, though not as much as you had planned for.
So, lawmakers in April 2025 reduced the appropriations in the budget bill by about $2 billion. The two-year spending plan was signed into law in May. That led to Gov. Mike Braun cutting agency budgets, laying off hundreds of state employees and limiting child care subsidies, among other austerity measures.
Fast forward to December 2025, and the annual forecast comes around again. Except this time, the projections move in the other direction — a surprise boon! That means the state will now take in far more money than it is scheduled to spend.
This would be your boss unexpectedly going back to the 3% raise. Would you adjust your spending for the year, or save the additional amount?
The state surplus is now expected to rise to nearly $5 billion by mid-2027 — about double what was anticipated last summer. That’s almost 22% of annual state spending, when legislators usually try to keep it between 10-15%.
Future action?
Democrats are pushing to reverse some key cuts.
House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said the first thing state government should do is eliminate the waitlist for low-income child care vouchers.
“Child care is such a big issue out there, for parents, for employers, something that we could do, we need to really work on that. We could use some of the money for that,” he told reporters Thursday. “I’ve toured a facility in Fort Wayne back in October, and then in December, they put out a notice that it’s closing. And it’s not the only one closing throughout the state. So the providers need paid; the parents need safe, productive places … where they can take their children. And that’s something that we really should do, and that’s everyone’s asking for. It very disappointing that it’s not on their priority list.”
The waitlist has entered its second year. There were more than 32,000 children in line in November, according to the latest update to a state dashboard. That’s constricting enrollment at providers already struck by the state’s cuts to voucher reimbursement rates.
Is the state really going to stockpile $5 billion when day cares are closing? And state employees are not getting a pay raise.
State Budget Director Chad Ranney told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the contingency fund that covers salary adjustments was reduced by 90%. While he hopes to find a way to help employees it might not be possible.
“The revenue has to materialize before we can spend it,” he said. “That’s a ton of money for the state to sit on but that’s 18 months away.”
Ranney also mentioned that the budget cut capital repair and rehabilitation funds, which could be adjusted
House Speaker Todd Huston said lawmakers were surprised when the forecast was downgraded last April and were surprised again with the positive news in December.
“That probably suggests to me that we probably should wait and see how this all shakes out. We know going into 2027 there are all sorts of changes taking place economically at the federal level and those types of things, and we really should probably wait to see how all that turns out,” he said Thursday. He hoped that would lead to a strong budget session in 2027.
There is a mechanism in state law to return surplus money to state taxpayers. The automatic taxpayer refund splits excess revenues between pension relief and income tax relief for Hoosiers. But it only kicks in during odd-numbered years unless lawmakers choose to change the schedule.
It doesn’t seem very conservative to take more taxpayer money than necessary, so Republicans have a choice: return it now or invest it in key areas that were previously slashed. Either can happen and still maintain an appropriate surplus to protect Indiana’s vaunted AAA credit rating and mantle of fiscal discipline.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Indiana is one of just a dozen states opting out of a summertime food aid program for hungry schoolchildren.
While anti-hunger advocates hope for a reversal, Indiana Family and Social Services Administration officials say the agency wasn’t appropriated the money required — and is busy planning for federal changes that could add a whopping $260 million a year to the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expenses.
“If we could figure out how to do SUN Bucks in a more integrated way … but we just don’t have the bandwidth, nor the funding,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob told the Capital Chronicle.
SUN Bucks provides $120 in grocery benefits across a summer per eligible school-age child. The federal government covers the benefit, and splits administrative costs 50-50 with states.

The program began as a pilot, but debuted nationwide in 2024. About 669,000 Hoosier school-age children participated that summer, with a collective $80 million loaded onto their debit-like electronic benefit transfer cards.
School breakfasts and lunches can be many students’ only reliable meals, and they lose access when the academic year ends.
“SNAP benefits don’t change in the summer. So, you know, when kids are home, it’s not as though there’s any additional benefit that families have to help pay the grocery bill,” said Emily Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry.
“This program was very successful in mediating the serious dangers of increase in child food insecurity during the pandemic,” Bryant said, referring to the temporary Pandemic EBT in place before SUN Bucks was established as a permanent option.
Gov. Mike Braun’s nascent administration didn’t take part in SUN Bucks last summer, and says the state will opt out this summer, too.
“The state of Indiana did it one time, and that was coming out of COVID,” Roob said. “And then, honestly, the previous administration didn’t plan to do it in 2025, so by the time we got here, that decision had been made for us — and there was not a legislative appropriation to do it for the upcoming year.
“Once you extend a a benefit, even on a temporary basis … taking it back is very painful,” he acknowledged.
Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia currently plan to participate, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program at the federal level.
Indiana is one of 12 that won’t, along with Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming.
Costs and benefits
The state and advocates differ on the initiative’s worth.
“The SUN Bucks program is extremely expensive to operate, and provides relatively little additional supplemental nutritional assistance,” Roob said.
SUN Bucks oversight was expected to cost the state about $3.7 million last summer. But expenses will seemingly more than triple, according to FSSA spokesman Marcus Barlow.
“We estimate the cost per year for Administration of the program to be between $12 million and $15 million,” Barlow wrote.
Bryant, of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry, acknowledged that while SNAP has higher administrative costs, it pulls down significantly more in benefits from the federal government — upwards of $100 million monthly across the program’s 570 million participants, according to FSSA’s latest quarterly financial report.
But SUN Bucks targets the state’s most vulnerable: kids, she said.
“The return on investment may not be as large as what they like to see for larger programs, but when there are over 600,000 kids who would be eligible for this program, that’s impactful for those families,” Bryant said.
Her organization was among the more than 90 private-sector, faith-based and nonprofit organizations that signed a letter urging Braun, FSSA and the state Department of Education to approve Indiana’s participation in SUN Bucks.
Price tag rising
Indiana’s cost concerns go beyond SUN Bucks, however.
States could be on the hook for millions of additional SNAP expenses annually under the latest federal reconciliation law, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
States currently pay 50% of the cost to administer SNAP, but beginning Oct. 1, 2026, they’ll be on the hook for 75%.
That’s expected to cost Indiana $37 million in the 2027 state fiscal year, which begins July 1 and ends June 30, and about $50 million annually after, according to FSSA’s latest quarterly financial report.
That could complicate the argument for SUN Bucks next summer, but advocates are still working to build support, said Mark Lynch, the director of advocacy for the Indy Hunger Network.
“We’ll start focusing on ’27 for SUN Bucks — knowing that it’s a long shot, because that’s going to be even closer to when they’re going to have to start these cost shares,” he said.
How will the megabill impact Indiana’s budget? Hundreds of millions in federal dollars will be lost

Starting Oct. 1, 2027, states will also pay a percentage of benefit costs depending on the rate of errors they make in distributing the funds — overpayments and underpayments. Indiana logged a 9.27% payment error rate in the 2024 federal fiscal year, per the report. That runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.
That percentage would’ve cost the state an estimated $143 million in a year. Fewer mistakes could lower the hit to $72 million or even $0, but a rate higher than 10% would cost $214 million.
Roob said FSSA is hiring 65 more employees to lower Indiana’s payment error rate.
“The cost equation here is a pretty simple one, right? It’s much cheaper to hire 65 people than it is to pay $70 million,” he said.
The changes don’t end there.
Braun has embarked on a variety of state-level alterations to SNAP, most prominently by directing FSSA to secure federal permission to block recipients from buying sugary drinks or candy with their benefits. Dubbed “Smart SNAP,” it went into effect Jan. 1.
Other executive orders would add Hoosiers exempt from SNAP work requirements to an existing but “underutilized” state employment and training program; tighten asset eligibility tests for SNAP and scrutinize the program’s efficacy.
They were announced at a “Make Indiana Healthy Again” event in April headlined by two celebrity members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.
State lawmakers are also considering changes.
Senate Bill 1, a priority proposal for the chamber’s Republican caucus, would end Indiana’s expanded eligibility for SNAP, which allows those with slightly more assets to participate than under the federal baseline. That would push an estimated 3,000 households off the program, according to a fiscal analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency.
Other provisions would set legal status requirements for SNAP participants — but count all of the income and assets of ineligible immigrants toward their household’s eligibility determination and benefit allotment.
“I’m very concerned about the ideological focus of a lot of the legislation and administrative actions,” said Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, speaking generally about recent moves. Clere is a prominent Statehouse advocate for SUN Bucks, SNAP, Medicaid and other programs.
“It may be well-intended, but it misses the mark if our big-picture goal is a more efficient and accountable system providing the best possible value for for all Hoosiers,” he said.
Looking elsewhere
Struggling Indiana residents can locate other summertime food help via DOE’s Summer Food Service Program.
Roob also highlighted the federal Women, Infants and Children nutrition program administered in Indiana by the Department of Health, along with food banks and pantries across the state.
“Our food banks have always and continue to serve folks in need … any time of the year, and that’s never going to change,” Bryant said.

But, she added, “We will continue to make the case that participating in federal nutrition programs … are more efficient and effective because they are at scale.”
Lynch, of the Indy Hunger Network, said food pantries noticed an increase in demand over the summer, “long before” a federal shutdown delayed SNAP benefit disbursement in the fall.
“We know what it looks like now,” he said of the demand.
Hoosiers can find free food — and stores that take SNAP and WIC — statewide using the network’s Community Compass website.
Food insecurity has risen in Indiana, according to a USDA report released late last year.
“There’s still so much hunger in Indiana, and there shouldn’t be — there doesn’t need to be,” said Clere. “… We have enough resources to reduce and ultimately eliminate hunger, but we often fail to make it a priority and to take advantage of resources that are available, and SUN Bucks is a great example.”
“We ought to be able to look past (administrative and other costs) for the benefit of the children who would … be better-fed and less hungry, and able to have a better summer and a better childhood,” he said. “That’s really what it comes down to.”

But alternatives to fossil jet fuel currently account for less than 1% of all jet fuel dispensed. (Photo courtesy of Alaska Air Group)A who’s who from Washington state business and Democratic politics on Thursday extolled the virtues of alternative jet fuel and said the state would strive to become the nation’s leading enabler of greener flying.
The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator. 
The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.
Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.
“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.
State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”
The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.
“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”
The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.
The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.
SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.
The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.
Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Thursday that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.
A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.
Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.
On the west side of the Cascades, BP received nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal is to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually using biomass feedstocks, like food waste, vegetable oil and beef tallow. The BP oil refinery in Whatcom County is connected by pipeline to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and the major airports in Vancouver, British Columbia and Portland, Oregon.
If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.
By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.
If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.
During a press availability following Thursday’s launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.
Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.
The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior advisor Andy Billig in a separate interview. Billig is a former state Senate majority leader who played an instrumental role in the 2023 passage of state tax incentives for SAF producers and users during his final term in office. The state tax credit is worth up to $2 per gallon and can be stacked with federal incentives.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alaska_airlines_biofuel_001-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-09 07:13:36.197807

“I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing right now, taking families,” Dasea-Torres said.
Over a thousand people joined Dasea-Torres Thursday. They walked the streets under a steady, cold rain, blocking traffic, blocks away from where Good, 37, was fatally shot Wednesday morning by a federal immigration agent who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune.
Many protestors likely have vivid memories of days of demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd, less than a mile from here.
Minneapolis residents have borne the brunt of the latest wave of immigration agents — said to be 2,000 — sent to Minnesota this week by the Department of Homeland Security.
No federal or local law enforcement appeared to be present at the Thursday evening protest. Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the Minnesota National Guard “out of an abundance of caution” to be prepared to help local law enforcement keep order.

Protests have been ongoing since the shooting. Protesters gathered at the scene immediately after the shooting; later that evening, thousands gathered to mourn Good in an evening vigil and a protest against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
Early Thursday morning, protesters clashed with federal agents at the Whipple Building, the federal building ICE has been using. The Star Tribune reported that agents threw some protesters to the ground and detained them; one protester was detained for throwing an apple core at a squad car.
And later that morning, more than 100 multifaith religious leaders huddled around the site of the shooting, which has been turned into a memorial for Good, to make three demands: that ICE leave Minnesota; that the federal government allow state investigators access to evidence for an independent state investigation; and that Congress also investigate the shooting.
A speech written by Jovita Morales from the Minnesota Immigrant Movement opened the Thursday evening protest, which was jointly organized and publicized on social media by local chapters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, 50501 and the Democratic Socialists of America.
“The incident in which an ICE agent took the life of our community member and a young woman demonstrates a complete lack of preparation and serious negligence. We demand justice through an investigation,” said Ivonne Hernandez, who delivered the speech on behalf of Morales.
On Wednesday, the feds kicked Minnesota criminal investigators off what was initially a joint investigation. The maneuver has drawn sharp criticism from local officials and protesters, who demanded an investigation independent from the federal government, whose top officials have already publicly drawn conclusions that contradict existing video evidence.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday that Good “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.” A video provided to the Reformer shows an officer positioning himself in front of the vehicle and firing three shots through the windshield as Good attempted to turn the car away from the officer.
Ben Andrews wasn’t aware of the protest in advance but saw it passing by his house. Andrews said he’s been receiving neighborhood notifications of ICE presence “semi-regularly.”
“This used to be a great neighborhood. This neighborhood was going up. All this ICE sh*t doesn’t make anybody better,” Andrews said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)We’re heartened to see even the smallest increase in human dignity behind bars, like the earned living unit at Stillwater Correctional Facility: Men sleeping safely in their own cells; “high” wages ($1.50 an hour); environmental beautification; couches and exercise equipment in common areas. These were common safety creating practices in the 1980s, and should be again. 
But why is Gov. Tim Walz spending millions on a temporary incentive in a facility that’s scheduled to close in 2029 while blocking the most important safety incentive on the books — earned release? 
In 2023, the Minnesota Rehabilitation and Reinvestment Act was signed by Walz, incentivizing safety through rehabilitation, with Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell leading the charge. Everyone in prison — not serving a life sentence — would now have an opportunity to earn up to 17% off their sentence, and 11% off supervision for completing programming and good behavior. Half the resulting savings to taxpayers were to be reinvested in victim services, the rest to rehabilitation, creating a feedback loop of safer prisons, communities and more supported victims. 
The DOC promised 18-24 months to implement. 
Now, 30 months later, the Walz administration appears to be undermining its own law. 
The Department of Corrections’ new implementation timeline means basically no releases until May of 2027 — yet every day families of the estimated 2,800 people potentially eligible for release may be losing time with their loved ones they can never get back. Failure to follow the law also stops the administration from their own policy goal of closing Stillwater early, wasting millions that could be used to create better conditions everywhere. 
This lack of leadership has consequences. Guards were stabbed and a man murdered in Rush City because the maximum security prison is unnecessarily overcrowded and double bunked, and people are losing the hope gained when the MRRA passed. 
Toxic prison environments are killing us, with both prison guards and long-term incarcerated people dying decades earlier than average. And this environment also contributes to recidivism — nearly 80% of DOC “graduates” are projected to be arrested within five years of release. 
Why is Walz signing laws he’s not willing to implement? 
Data suggests incentive-based leave programs like the MRRA can dramatically reduce recidivism: In Oregon, just 10% who earned significant incentive returned, compared to 30% who didn’t, per Crime Victims United, while return rates were 55% lower under the federal First Step Act.
The facts show that rehabilitation is not a luxury, it is a basic precondition for safety, both for people inside prisons and the broader community. 
Nor does stalling create safety. Everyone eligible for MRRA will be released regardless of rehabilitation. So while some may jeer whenever someone let out early is returned to prison, we know the individuals in question will be released one way or another. 
The question is not whether some will come back, but, rather, how do we get the most safety with our tax dollars? 
By incentivizing rehabilitation through earned early release, the MRRA increases safety for everyone who lives and works in prison, as well as for the community once people are released. Savings become investments in victims and further rehabilitation. A fully utilized MRRA would be a huge step towards making safety the rule – not the exception.
But it won’t if this administration fails to follow the law they signed.  
A recent Minnesota court case found unconstitutional the gradual rollout of a new child welfare law to just 30% of those eligible, because it failed to provide equal protection to the 100% it should support. The current MRRA rollout is denying nearly everyone eligible.  
As we write, three men in Faribault are suing on the same grounds. Though currently without legal representation, they recognize that every day that slips away is time stolen from children, parents, friends — time they will never get back, even if the MRRA is eventually implemented. 
This is playing politics with people’s lives. And a governor who signs legislation but doesn’t implement it is, in effect, a governor in name only.
Governor: As you sit down with your own family in the coming months, we beg you to consider if anything can substitute for the living presence of loved ones in the sacred moments of our lives. 
Nor should we erase the fact that Schnell, the DOC commissioner, successfully intervened to lighten the prison sentence of his ex-wife, following her conviction for premeditated attempted murder. When it came to his family he understood that time is all we have. Under the MRRA law, all Minnesotans should have access to earn a fraction of what the commissioner’s own family has already received. 
We – incarcerated Minnesotans, their loved ones, and all who want safer communities – call on Schnell, Walz and the Legislature to do right by the 27,000 people under the DOC’s control.
Implement the safety law you championed, passed and signed.
If reform is to mean anything, it must be measured not by legislation passed or photo ops at facilities slated to close, but by lives changed. Anything less is political theater.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN251120_166-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 07:13:36.197807

Helping people recover requires a strong system where treatment and community-based recovery supports work together.
Treatment provides medical care and counseling during a crisis. Recovery support services help people stay on track afterward by building routine, confidence, and healthy connections.
These supports include peer mentoring, transportation, job and family assistance and recovery community centers. For many people, recovery housing is also an important piece of this system. A safe and stable place to live can make the difference between moving forward in recovery or falling back into old patterns.
As the executive director of the Missouri Coalition of Recovery Support Providers, I work with programs that offer these community-based supports across the state. Our members include faith-based, peer-based and community-based organizations that help people rebuild their lives. We work closely with treatment providers, courts and health agencies because recovery is strongest when all parts of the system are connected. No single agency can meet every need, and no one recovers alone.
Within this broad network of services, recovery housing has a special role. When people leave treatment, jail, or unstable living situations, they need a safe place to go. The environment they enter can have a major impact on their long-term success. Good recovery homes offer structure, peer support, and accountability. They give people a stable foundation during one of the most vulnerable points in their recovery journey.
That is why MCRSP serves as Missouri’s official affiliate of the National Alliance for Recovery Residences, the national leader in defining safety and quality standards for recovery housing. In this role, MCRSP reviews and accredits recovery homes across Missouri. We make sure these homes meet clear standards for safety, resident rights, operations, peer support, and ethical practices.
Accreditation is a sign that a home is committed to safety and quality. Accredited homes undergo a formal review and must make improvements when needed. They are checked again on a regular basis. This gives families, treatment providers, courts, and state agencies confidence that the residence is safe and well-run.
Choosing an accredited home also protects residents from unsafe or poorly managed facilities. Standards around safety, privacy, training, financial responsibility, and peer support help prevent harm and create a positive environment for recovery.
For professionals in health care, behavioral health, criminal justice or social services, referring clients to accredited recovery residences should be the first choice. Accredited homes offer the strongest assurance that residents will be supported and protected. They also provide the structure and peer connections that research shows improve long-term recovery outcomes.
Accredited homes strengthen the communities around them as well. With clear rules, trained leaders, and strong local partnerships, these homes help reduce stigma and build trust. Safe, well-run housing benefits both the residents and the neighborhoods they are part of.
As Missouri continues to invest in behavioral health, we must ensure that recovery housing grows with the same level of safety and oversight as the rest of the system. Accreditation is not a barrier — it is a safeguard for residents, families, and communities.
Recovery is personal, but it should not be faced alone. When treatment providers, state agencies, and community partners work together and choose accredited recovery residences, Missourians have their best chance to rebuild their lives and regain hope.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1737318871-e1767914815756-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-09 06:57:01.588651

Lawmakers have already sought to restrict immigration arrests at courthouses. Other states have attempted additional restrictions with varying success.

Can Vermont lawmakers restrict how federal immigration authorities operate in the state?
Democrats are poised to try this session, mulling legislation that would limit where civil immigration arrests can occur and would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks in most cases. 
Vermonters should be able to visit sensitive locations “without fear of being snatched,” Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, a sponsor of two bills addressing immigration agents’ actions, told her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The bills were introduced in the Senate this week. S.209 would prevent civil arrests at schools, government buildings, health care facilities and what the bill calls community-based shelters, severe weather shelters and emergency housing. Meanwhile, S.208, largely restricts when law enforcement officers can wear masks and requires officers to identify themselves verbally or by badge. 
Federal courts have met similar policies elsewhere in the country with mixed reactions, and President Donald Trump’s administration continues to challenge states’ attempts to regulate U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, such as in California, where lawmakers have sought to generally ban federal agents from wearing masks.  
Both pieces of legislation in Vermont cite the 10th Amendment, which gives states powers not specifically granted to the federal government. 
But legislative attorneys cautioned Vermont’s Senate Judiciary Committee that the potential legality of restricting ICE in Vermont would depend on a tangled web of federal laws, case law and active court cases. 
Rik Sehgal, a lawyer for the Legislature, told lawmakers Wednesday that federal courts have for the most part found that limited arrests by immigration authorities at courthouses is “approved by the 10th Amendment.”
Whether states can restrict immigration arrests in more locations is “a little bit gray,” he said.
And regarding the federal laws potentially restricting Vermont’s ability to limit federal agents from wearing masks, Sophie Zdatny, a lawyer for the Legislature, told lawmakers that “the Supreme Court has really not addressed this particular immunity for over a century.”
There’s no federal law, policy or rule that explicitly authorizes masking for law enforcement, Zsatny said, though U.S. Department of Homeland Security leaders have said officers have discretion to wear masks. 
Both bills have strong support from Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, who sits on the judiciary committee. In an interview Thursday, he pointed to the increasing presence of ICE in Minneapolis, where an immigration agent shot and killed a woman Wednesday, as a reason why the bills are necessary.  
“We have to be proactive about that, because I will bet you every cent I have that within the year, Burlington and Winooski will see raids,” Baruth said, adding that he was comfortable supporting bills the Trump administration might challenge in court. “We’re kind of fighting with our backs to the wall as states.”
In Vermont, federal immigration agents have conducted arrests wearing masks. Mohsen Mahdawi, a Vermonter and Palestinian activist, was detained by masked officers in Colchester following an interview regarding his citizenship. 
In 2022, Vermont lawmakers restricted immigration arrests in and around courthouses, a protection other states have attempted to enshrine as well. In other states, ICE has made a practice of arresting immigrants in and around courthouses. Last November, a federal judge upheld a New York law preventing immigration arrests at state courts.  
Rep. Martin LaLonde, D-South Burlington, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said he intended to take up the Senate’s ICE bills should they reach his committee later this year.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel advanced legislation Thursday that would require electric companies to develop new tariffs to be levied on “large-load” data centers, with the goal of protecting New Jersey residents, businesses, and other regular ratepayers from increased costs driven by the power-hungry centers.
The bill would require public electric utilities to submit proposed tariffs to the state Board of Public Utilities and incentivize data centers to increase energy efficiency by adopting technologies that capture and use the heat they generate. Under the bill, energy users of more than 100 megawatts monthly would be charged the new tariffs beginning one year after the bill’s enactment.
The bill has 10 sponsors, all Democrats.
New tax subsidies for Prudential Center renovation inch closer to law

It passed along party lines in the Senate’s budget committee, despite debate among lawmakers and advocates about whether the measure would achieve its goal of insulating regular ratepayers from increased costs.
Alex Ambrose of progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective urged legislators to pass the bill, reminding them that the Garden State’s utility rates are 20% higher than the national average and will continue to rise without action.
Artificial intelligence data centers already are straining the region’s power grid, and the situation could worsen, Ambrose said. PJM Interconnection — the region’s energy grid operator — could soon allow data centers to connect to the grid even if there’s not enough energy, she noted.
“That means that data centers may be prioritized over regular people,” Ambrose said. “It’s clear that PJM and the federal government aren’t going to help, so it’s time for the states to step up. We need guardrails to protect people from higher bills. This is one step in the right direction.”
But Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) called the plan “a shell game” in which ratepayers likely still will get stuck with higher bills. O’Scanlon, along with the committee’s three other Republican members, voted against the bill.
“This is really just a transfer of cost. These operators and data centers, their percentage of profit — if they want to make it, they’re going to make it. If we charge them more to take electricity costs and dump it on them, they’re just going to charge it back to keep their profit,” O’Scanlon said. “It’s going to come right back to the end users to be paid through our phones, our data plans, etcetera.”
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), a committee member and one of the bill’s prime sponsors, countered that data centers “are different, and they have to be treated differently.” PJM has reported that it expects energy demand in its 13-state service area to grow 32 gigawatts by 2030, with most — 30 gigawatts — coming from data centers.
Burzichelli and the panel’s eight other Democrats voted in favor of the bill.
The full Assembly passed the bill in June, and it’s expected to go before the full Senate for a vote Monday. It’s unclear whether Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, would sign it. He leaves office on Jan. 20.

Hemp, used for industrial purposes and now grown legally in Wisconsin, is made from a variety of the cannabis plant that is low in THC, the active ingredient that is responsible for the intoxicating effect of marijuana. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Wisconsin lawmakers are backing competing visions for the future of hemp in the state. One proposal, (SB 682), was discussed during a Thursday meeting of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Revenue. The bill would create a regulatory structure for hemp-derived cannabis products which would preserve the state’s hemp industry despite a federal ban set to take effect in November. Without state-level intervention, or the federal government choosing to reverse course, hemp growers and distributors fear that Wisconsin’s $700 million industry and about 3,500 jobs will disappear.
Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), chair of the  Agriculture and Revenue Committee presented the bipartisan hemp bill to his committee, which he authored with bipartisan support. Testin’s legislation would define hemp as cannabis plants with no more than 0.3% of delta-9 THC (or the maximum concentration allowable under federal law up to 1%, whichever is greater) and define “hemp-derived cannabinoids” as any such compound extracted from the hemp plant. THC concentrations would be determined using specific high-performance testing methods. 
Wisconsinites would need to be at least 21 years old to purchase hemp-derived cannabinoid products under the bill, which mandates that products undergo independent lab testing to ensure that they contain the amount and type of cannabinoids described on the product’s label. This practice, known as truth-in labeling, is something the hemp industry has called for in recent years. 
Products could not be sold under the bill without labeling including contact information for the manufacturer or brand owner, serving sizes per container of product, ingredient lists including allergens, potency labeled in milligrams, and any necessary warnings. Under the bill, hemp-derived products could not contain more than 10 milligrams of THC in a single serving. 
Testin said Thursday that globally, the industrial hemp market was valued at roughly $11 billion in 2025, and is expected to reach $48 billion by 2032. “Despite its wide availability, the regulation of [hemp-derived cannabinoid] products is essentially non-existent, leaving a patchwork of different approaches taken by states across the country,” he said. 
In Wisconsin, such products “are generally recognized as legal but unregulated,” Testin said. “There are no state laws that restrict the sale to minors, regulate the potency or content of [hemp-derived cannabinoid products], or establish labeling or packaging requirements.” Minnesota, Kentucky, Tennessee and other states have moved to enact their own regulations, Testin said. “Regulations are needed to eliminate the current uncertainty regarding the status of [hemp-derived cannabinoid products], provide stability and certainty for businesses looking to enter this segment of the economy, and enact public safety regulations.”
Both Testin and Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) have worked on hemp laws for Wisconsin since the federal Farm Bill passed in 2018. “I’ve actually grown hemp,” said Kurtz, recalling that in 2019 “it was kind of a wide open market.” People that Kurtz and others called “bad actors” throughout the hearing also rode the hemp wave, seeing it as a “get rich quick scheme.” Kurtz said that today, the hemp industry is filled with people who want to do the right thing, but that “bad actors” have persisted. 
Kurtz said SB 682 is designed to ensure that Wisconsinites “get the very best product, and they know what they’re getting.” He stressed that “if we do nothing, then hemp is going to be illegal at the federal level…but it will still be legal here in the state of Wisconsin. So I think it would behoove us to work together, get a good compromise, a good common sense piece of legislation to make sure that we — in my humble opinion — protect our constituents, but also protect an industry that I think is needed.” 
Although hemp would be illegal at the federal level, a state-level industry could still operate similarly to the way some states have fully legal recreational or legalized cannabis programs, largely because the federal government has not cracked down on those industries. 
Testin added that “regardless of anyone’s thoughts as it relates to cannabis and cannabinoids, it’s here. And obviously we have a lot of different approaches as to how to best move forward.” He repeatedly took aim at the “stupidity” of what he described as “our overlords” in Washington D.C., but also criticized other hemp-related bills being pushed in Wisconsin. Whereas some Republicans are seeking to ban hemp products outright, others have differing ideas about how a legal industry should be regulated. 
A bill introduced by Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), SB 681, would require that manufacturers and distributors of hemp-derived cannabinoid products have permits. Products would be sold under a three-tier system, and would be regulated similarly to alcohol under the Division of Alcohol Beverages, a component of the Department of Revenue, which would be renamed to the Division of Intoxicating Products. 
Although both Testin and Wimberger’s bills have gained bipartisan support, Testin described Wimberger’s bill as “the dead bill” and “deader than dead.” Testin argued that SB 681 would over-regulate the hemp industry, and even lead to a monopolization effect where a small number of entities could control who gets hemp permits, shape an otherwise competitive market, and operate in a “good ol’ boys club” manner. 
Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) highlighted  the divide among state Republicans over hemp and cannabis products, stressing that Democrats are not the ones holding up legalization and regulation.
The committee room was filled with people from across the hemp industry who listened to the conversation. When lawmakers questioned how to ensure that children do not acquire intoxicating hemp products, distributors and manufacturers pointed to age-verification software even for online sales, which require a photograph and image of a driver’s license to approve an order. There was also discussion about how to prevent products from being marketed to children using cartoon-like advertising and appealing candy wrappers. 
Some veterans testified, describing how hemp helped them alleviate pain, kick addictive pain killers, soothed PTSD symptoms, and calmed the body for sleep. Other testimony centered on the danger involved in crossing state lines to Michigan or Illinois to acquire cannabis to treat various medical conditions. Hemp farmers stressed that they need to know now how they will be affected by a looming federal ban as they decide when or whether to plant their crops in the spring. 
Much of the public testimony was supportive of  Testin’s bill, though some speakers said that it needed to be amended to protect farmers and growers, and also expand the kinds of products it would cover including drinks and gummies. 
“Yes, we are now in a scenario where there are intoxicating hemp products,” said Testin. “But just no different than anything like beer, wine, or alcohol, we need to have some sensible regulations put in place, which this bill aims to do just that.”
As for “concerns about getting baked or getting high from these products,” Testin added, “it’s no different than those individuals who go out and consume too many old fashioneds at fish fry on a Friday night, or have too many beers. It’s about personal choice and responsibility, but at the same time making sure that we have some regulations put in place.”
The hemp industry deserves to “thrive and grow,” Testin said, while the public deserves protection and to know “that this stuff isn’t falling into the hands of people it shouldn’t be in, like kids.”

Imagine if someone committed a crime when they were in their twenties that required them to serve two years in prison, but due to a system error, they were held until they were 50. For nearly 30 years, this person was in prison despite being eligible for release decades earlier. The second the story broke, there would be a national outcry at the injustice.
Sadly, this isn’t a hypothetical. This is the reality for countless people across New Jersey. Many individuals who committed crimes decades ago, served their time, and are eligible to have those records expunged are trapped in a virtual prison, unaware of how to access expungement. Despite being eligible for the freedom of a fresh start, they live smaller lives, avoiding situations where their past record may be an issue. Meanwhile, someone in the same situation will have received an expungement the moment they were eligible and resumed their regular life, simply because they had the resources and the knowledge to do it.
For the past year, in partnership with legislators, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, Volunteers of America Delaware Valley, community barbershops, and churches from across the state, STONO Public Affairs has hosted nine “expungement clinics” in cities across the state. These clinics were designed to assist people who may be eligible for an expungement of a past crime but are unaware of how to access it. STONO worked purposely to bring these services out of government buildings directly to the community with the help of barbershop owners and faith leaders.
What we found is that thousands of people are being held hostage by the worst day of their lives. Even when people have recovered, matured, worked hard to change their lives, and demonstrated that for over 20 years they have not had one other incident involving law enforcement, they are still trapped by what happened on that one bad day.
But that one bad day ultimately impacts us all. The lingering impact of that one day leads people to avoid better employment opportunities, presuming they will be denied. As a result, entire communities that would otherwise be eligible for jobs where there are critical vacancies, like health care, do not bother applying and take lesser-paying jobs, impacting their ability to support themselves and the overall economy.
Housing is another area in which criminal records often present barriers. Landlords in more “desirable neighborhoods,” in areas closer to better schools, are more likely to do background checks, excluding individuals who have more than served their time, and furthering the state’s segregation problem. The lingering effects of that one bad day may make people ineligible for homeownership or educational or training opportunities that could lift their families out of poverty. More than anything, it denies them the simple dignity of being judged by who they are and not what they did 20 years ago.
The faces and crowds at our expungement clinics point to the historic over policing of Black and brown communities. When faced with the choice of arrest, grace is rarely an option for these individuals. Over the years, the courts have shown a commitment to alternatives to incarceration. However, the large turnout at these events indicates that a commitment to alternatives to arrest may be more necessary.
Additionally, we observed that many people are not eligible for expungement because their crime was classified as a “terroristic threat” at the time of arrest. Often, this threat was made during a heated argument or fight.  Given our recent history, it is understandable that a terroristic threat should always be taken seriously and remain on one’s record. However, the definition should be refined to ensure the description is accurate. A threat made in the heat of the moment is distinct from a threat intended to advance terrorism.
Legal expungement can be life-changing for those affected, but it is often overlooked by those who are not impacted. New Jersey Public Defender Jen Sellitti deserves praise for making this process accessible by bringing expungement lawyers to the community. This effort is creating new opportunities for entire communities who have long felt left behind and forgotten. Despite changes that come with a new administration, it is crucial to continue prioritizing expungement assistance in 2026 and beyond.

The proposals collectively seek to loosen local zoning rules to spur housing construction; change how utilities are regulated and compensated; streamline state government oversight bodies; and repeal thousands of words of education statute lawmakers say are outdated or unused.

Huston made clear, however, that House Republicans do not intend to reopen the state budget.
“This year’s priorities build on efforts advanced in recent years to reduce costs, get government out of the way and grow our economy,” he said.
The session is expected to end by late February — even earlier than usual short sessions  — after lawmakers returned to the Statehouse for two weeks in December to debate a contentious redistricting proposal that ultimately failed to pass.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said that while some of the proposed housing provisions could help reduce rents, Democrats saw limited progress in the GOP agenda.
“It seemed to me, at first glance, it’s pretty lackluster when it comes to trying to save Hoosiers money on their utility bills,” GiaQuinta said. “It doesn’t mention anything with regards to health care or child care. These are issues that we’ve been talking about for a long time now — and it’s not just us, it’s what Hoosiers are looking for.”
Housing supply and local zoning rules
House Bill 1001, authored by Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, targets housing affordability by limiting local zoning regulations and streamlining approvals for new residential development.
Miller, a home builder himself, said Indiana has “constrained supply far too long” through “unnecessary and problematic regulations and restrictions,” contributing to high homeownership costs.
“House Republicans have made it a priority to increase housing stock in the state of Indiana,” Miller said, noting nearly $75 million in housing investments in recent budget cycles. “Yet the costs to own a home — they remain high.”

The bill would allow certain housing uses to be approved without public hearings, cap parking requirements, limit local design standards and require mixed-use or multifamily housing to be permitted in some commercially zoned areas. It also expands allowances for accessory dwelling units, such as backyard or in-law apartments.
Miller said the goal is not to strip authority from local governments, but to work within their existing frameworks.
“We’re not taking decision-making away from local authorities,” he said. “What we’re actually doing is working within the guidelines that they already operate.”
The legislation also requires local governments to begin reporting housing approval data to the state, which Miller said will help identify “bottlenecks.”
“We don’t know what we don’t know,” he said.
GiaQuinta said Democrats are open to parts of the proposal, particularly provisions that could reduce construction costs and lower rents. 
He pointed to requirements tied to building materials and design standards as potential contributors to higher housing prices, but he cautioned lawmakers to closely examine the actual savings and impacts on local control.
“If that can lower costs — and lower (monthly payments) for folks that are living in an apartment — there are probably some things in there that are a good first step,” GiaQuinta said. “But if our goal is to reduce costs, we’re going to have to really take a deep dive and see what the exact savings are going to be.”
Utility accountability and energy affordability
Next up, House Bill 1002, authored by Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, would overhaul how Indiana regulates electric utilities by moving forward with performance-based rate making and multi-year rate plans.
“Indiana’s regulatory structure has served us well for generations,” Shonkwiler said. “But that framework was built for a very different energy era.”
She said that although Indiana’s residential electric rates remain among the lowest in the Great Lakes region, families are still struggling to afford utility bills.

“Hoosiers are still feeling the financial burden of heating, cooling and lighting their homes,” she said. “We are updating our regulatory tools so utilities are held accountable for delivering the outcomes we want: strong reliability, improved resilience and better affordability.”
The bill would tie utility profits to performance metrics such as affordability, service restoration and reliability.
Utilities would additionally be required to place customers on budget billing plans by default — allowing ratepayers to opt out — and would be prohibited from disconnecting service to certain low-income customers during periods of extreme summer heat.
Shonkwiler described the approach as “incremental” but significant for Indiana, which has not previously adopted performance-based regulation at this scale.
“This is about modernizing regulation in a way that still protects consumers,” she said.
Still, GiaQuinta said Democrats remain skeptical that the bill would deliver meaningful or timely savings.
“One thing that we can do right off the bat is suspend the sales tax on utilities,” GiaQuinta suggested. “On electricity alone, that’s about $350 a year. And if you do that on all utilities, that really starts to add up.”
Consolidating boards and commissions
Another measure, House Bill 1003, authored by Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty, proposes repealing, merging or “restructuring” dozens of state boards, commissions and councils.
In its current form, the massive 346-page bill would eliminate 56 state commissions, committees, boards, task forces and councils, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.
“This is a product over three years of work,” Bartels said. A legislative task force debated possible cuts to Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions in November.
“The intent here,” Bartels continued, “is to increase government efficiency and effectiveness.”
While the bill includes “modest cost savings,” he emphasized that money is not the primary goal.
Story continues below.
Dozens of state boards, commissions and councils would be affected by House Bill 1003, authored by Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty. (List from a legislative fiscal analysis published on Jan. 7, 2026)
“The intent is not necessarily to specifically save money,” Bartels said. “It’s efficiency.”
Huston echoed that view, saying overlapping boards can create confusion and duplicate work.
“You’re creating multiple work streams out of that, and oftentimes those work streams are not even congruent with one another,” Huston said.
The bill also makes sweeping changes to administrative rulemaking, professional licensing and the state building code, transferring some responsibilities to the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, for example.
Some suggestions — including elimination of the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission — have already been criticized, however.
A representative from the Indiana Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, for example, previously told lawmakers he was concerned about building code decisions and changes being made by state agency staffers or lawmakers without the involvement of the commission, whose members include architects, professional engineers and others with construction experience.
More K-12 education deregulation
Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, said his House Bill 1004 continues a multi-year effort to strip unused or outdated language from Indiana’s education code.
“This legislation improves Indiana’s education framework by removing restrictive, redundant and unnecessary statutory requirements,” Behning said.

He added that the bill, as currently drafted, would eliminate more than 19,000 words from state law — following last year’s removal of nearly 35,000 words in a separate deregulation measure — and cleans up conflicting definitions, unused programs and obsolete mandates.
“The goal is really to let education get out of the way, let educators do what they do best,” he said.
Behning noted that the bill would further repeal outdated reporting requirements, remove defunct grant programs and eliminate mandates that “no longer” align with how schools operate, including provisions tied to obsolete technology and programs no longer funded by the state.
Huston called education deregulation one of the House GOP’s most persistent — and challenging — priorities.
“It’s oftentimes asked for, but oftentimes hard to accomplish,” he said. “We want to create a flexible system to do it.”
GiaQuinta told reporters he still needed to review the 168-page bill but questioned the effort.
“Rep. Behning now has been in charge of the education committee since 2011, and he keeps wanting to deregulate the things that he was responsible — and the House Republicans have been responsible — for putting in (state code),” GiaQuinta said. “Maybe they’re correcting the errors of their ways. I don’t really know what the plan is there, so we’ll continue to monitor that.”

Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) after delivering testimony on AB 678. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin school districts would be required to establish policies on appropriate communication between students and staff members before the next school year, under a bill that received a public hearing Thursday. 
The bill comes in reaction to a report from the Capital Times in November that found over 200 investigations into teacher licenses due to allegations of sexual misconduct or grooming from 2018 to 2023. Another bill coauthored by Nedweski, AB 677, making grooming a felony crime in Wisconsin received a public hearing earlier this week.
“Many of these cases begin with the erosion of professional boundaries when a school employee starts communicating with the students inappropriately often outside of school hours and without parent knowledge usually through the use of text messaging and social media,”  Nedweski told the Assembly Education Committee. “While the vast majority of school staff use these tools responsibly, a small number have exploited that access — sometimes leading to devastating consequences.”
AB 678 would require Wisconsin school boards to adopt a policy on appropriate communications between students and employees or volunteers in the school district.
“This bill preserves local control. It does not mandate a one-size-fits-all policy; instead it allows each school district to determine what communication policies work best for its own community,” Nedweski said.
The policies would need to include specific consequences for staff who violate the policy and specify that it applies to communications during and outside of school hours. The policy would need to include standards for appropriate content and methods of communication.
An amendment to the bill, which Nedweski said came at the request of the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) and other stakeholders, would require annual training for employees on identifying, preventing and reporting grooming and professional boundary violations. 
The Department of Public Instruction has worked with Nedweski on the legislation and supports it. 
“We think this is a good effort to get the conversation started,” Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy said, noting the agency has been working on policy related to appropriate communication for over eight years. He said there are a lot of districts that are using technology for software that allows them to track communications. 
“There’s a bit of a dichotomy with this issue. We know that in order to educate kids we need to foster and build relationships with students and families, and so we do encourage appropriate communication in every school district,” McCarthy said, adding that the policy and training would be critical. “You will find some circumstances where you’re going to want communication and it might not be as neat and tidy as you’d expect it to be. There are always emergency circumstances where a teacher might need to call a student directly… so we want some policies to be flexible to address those areas.” 
Chris Kulow, director of government relations for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards (WASB), said the organization had some concerns about the language in the bill related to consequences. He testified for information only, noting the issue of communication between staff and students is not new to school districts. 
“Although recent news coverage and increased interest from state policymakers may make this appear to be a new issue, it is not new to schools. School boards have long recognized the need for policies addressing appropriate communication and professional boundaries between pupils and staff. Many districts have already adopted such policies,” Kulow said. “This bill may require some districts to update existing policies to reflect its specific language and to the extent it prompts boards to review and strengthen policies is beneficial.” 
Kulow said complying with the provision related to consequences as currently written would be challenging as violations can vary widely and require a wide range of responses. The organization wanted the provision removed, but said Nedweski wanted something related to be included in the bill. 
“Attempting to predetermine specific consequences for every specific scenario may be impractical and could complicate the disciplinary process,” Kulow said. “We suggested revising the language in the bill to read that ‘the school board shall include in the policy a range of consequences up to and including termination.’”
The bill currently only covers Wisconsin public schools, though Nedweski told Democratic lawmakers, who expressed concerns about the bill not including the state’s private voucher schools, that she is working on an amendment. 
“We need to protect all kids. This is such a growing problem. We’ve seen just an increase in inappropriate communication,” Nedweski said.
Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), also asked whether lawmakers would be open to including funding for school districts to support the implementation of the bill. 
Nedweski said she hasn’t had any requests for funding from schools or the DPI throughout the development of the bill.
“I think it’s a serious enough issue, a weighty enough issue, that all schools can find the resources to craft a policy and do some training to make sure they are protecting children,” Nedweski said, adding that DPI already has modules related to this type of training.
McCarthy said additional funding, including the release of $1 million set aside for the agency in the state budget, could help speed along the process. Those funds, which sit in a supplemental fund, can only be released by the Joint Finance Committee. He said without the funds the agency could potentially have to cut down on staff and other areas of its operations, which could affect how quickly work is done.
Under the bill in its current form, school boards would need to adopt a policy by July 1, 2026. 
McCarthy said DPI would like to see an amendment that would move the deadline for policy adoption to a later date, saying DPI may need a longer “runway” to ensure the agency has time to change and update policies and training if needed. He told the Wisconsin Examiner that some of the changes could be necessary if Nedweski’s grooming bill becomes law. 
Rich Judge, assistant state superintendent for the division of government and public affairs, also noted that school boards would need to have time to meet, develop and approve policies. 
Nedweski said in a written statement to the Examiner that she is taking the agency’s suggestion under consideration and is discussing potential dates. One potential date could be Sept. 1, 2026, she said. 
“If AB 678 is signed into law, the goal is for school districts to have these policies in place for the 2026–27 school year,” Nedweski said. She noted that some of the agency’s concerns are tied to her other bill. “This only underscores the importance of passing AB 677 and getting it signed into law promptly to ensure that districts across Wisconsin can take the necessary steps to better protect students in school.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_174346145-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-09 06:57:01.588651

DemasThe herculean effort to extend lapsed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act tax credits put in place during the COVID era passed in the U.S. House Thursday evening, with enough Republicans voting in favor of the extension to put it over the top.
Michigan’s entire Republican congressional delegation, however, voted against the measure to extend the tax credits for three years.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) on Wednesday said that House Democrats needed just a slim margin of support from their Republican colleagues, estimating that four could do it. 
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

On Thursday evening, they got support from 17.
They included Reps. Mike Carey (Ohio), Andrew Garbarino (N.Y.), Ryan Mackenzie (Pa.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), David Joyce (Ohio), Tom Kean (N.J.), Nick LaLota (N.Y.), Max Miller (Ohio), David Valadao (Calif.), Rob Wittman (Va.), Jeff Hurd (Colo.), Maria Elvira-Salazar (Fla.), Rob Bresnahan (Pa.), Derrick Van Orden (Wis.), Zach Nunn (Iowa) and Monica De La Cruz (Texas).
The 230-196 vote sends the legislation to the Senate, where Republican leadership is unlikely to put it on the floor without considerable changes, which a bipartisan group of senators appears close to finalizing. 
Prior to the vote, Tlaib said she and her fellow Democrats were able to muster a vote through legislative maneuvering that stood “against the will of Trump and Republican leadership.”
“The American people want health care,” Tlaib said in a supplemental post on X. “Not a $1.5 trillion Pentagon budget.”

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said Congress has ignored the health care cost crisis for more than a year under the current leadership of House Speaker Mike Johnson. 
“Despite the Speaker stonewalling us for months, Republican members joined Democrats to force a vote to extend the tax credits that will save families in our community thousands of dollars per year,” McDonald Rivet said in a statement. “The Senate needs to vote on renewing these tax credits immediately. Every day they delay is another day that doctors’ appointments, cancer screenings, and emergency room visits are out of reach for working people in mid-Michigan.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) praised the passage and called it “a big step to protect Michigan families from rising health care costs.” 
“I proudly voted yes to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that make coverage more accessible for tens of thousands of Michiganders who rely on it every month,” Stevens said in a statement. “I’ll keep fighting to lower health care costs and make sure no one is priced out of the care they need.”
Also applauding Michigan’s Democratic delegation for helping lead the way was Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel.

“This is what leadership looks like — putting working families first and fighting to make health care affordable,” Hertel said in a statement. “While this was a big, bipartisan win for Michigan families, every Michigan Republican in Congress voted against lowering health care costs, and along with Mike Rogers, have uniformly supported the plan that forced premium hikes on hundreds of thousands of Michiganders at the beginning of the year.”
Hertel was referring to Rogers’ previous time in the U.S. House, as he is not currently serving and did not vote on the tax credit extension.
State Sen. Sean McCann (D-Grand Rapids), who is a candidate to face U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) in the 4th Congressional District race, also praised the passage on Thursday evening.
“As costs continue to rise at the grocery store and the pharmacy, Bill Huizenga has yet again sold Michigan families down the river,” McCann said. “First, he voted for the largest Medicaid cuts in history – and just now, he voted to raise health insurance premiums. We’ve had enough of politicians in DC playing games with peoples’ lives. In Congress, I will work to actually lower costs and expand access to health care for Michigan families.”
Earlier on Thursday, Michigan Families for Fair Care held a press conference in Lansing and urged U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) to vote yes on the measure. The press call also featured Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy, who said while the monetary cost of losing health care access was top of mind for struggling Michiganders, the human cost was also high.
“The human cost is, when someone gets sick, and they don’t have health care, they’re likely to delay their health care,” Stanton said. “And that ultimately means, especially if you have a chronic condition, it’s going to get worse and to potentially a crisis point before you actually access health care.”
Barrett ultimately voted no against the measure.

Health care is too expensive for all of us, but extending broken Obamacare subsidies without reforming them is not the answer. These blank checks to big insurance companies do nothing to actually put patients first, prevent premium hikes, or eliminate the rampant fraud and abuse… pic.twitter.com/zuANeCZz0J
— Congressman Tom Barrett (@RepTomBarrett) January 8, 2026

“The program that Democrats put forward today would advantage the top 1% income earners, on the backs of working-class Americans, and I simply can’t stand behind that,” Barrett said in a statement. “I’m looking for real reforms in health care that will empower patients [and] put more money in your pocket, so that you can choose the health care plan that works for you, while bypassing the health insurance companies for the profitability that they’ve been taking at our advantage.”
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), one of the leading Republican gubernatorial candidates, also voted against the measure. 
In a Facebook post, James accused the Democrats of “flailing” — even though they just netted a huge win — and “selling your health & kids’ futures by extending COVID-era Obamacare handouts to billion-dollar insurers – for just 7% of Americans!”
“My solution: Price transparency for CHEAPER, BETTER healthcare for 100% of Americans!” James wrote. “Dems’ fix: Prop up broken ‘sick-care’ system making us sicker and subsidizing 58k dead people. ACA spiked premiums 80% + billions in tax-funded FRAUD! Don’t let them get away with it.”
In response, the Democratic Governors Association lambasted him and other Republicans in gubernatorial races across the country.
“Today, every Republican in Congress running for governor once again voted to jack up costs and turn their backs on the residents of their states who are already facing skyrocketing health insurance premiums this year,” the association said in a statement. “Donald Trump and Republicans’ disastrous budget law was a major vulnerability for Republican candidates who got blown out of the water in New Jersey and Virginia in 2025, and this vote ensures those headwinds are going to be even worse in governors races across the country in 2026.”

Wyoming could leave $800M on the table if it doesn't implement the  proposals outlined in its application. 
The post What’s at stake if Wyoming lawmakers don’t act on $205M proposal to improve rural health? appeared first on WyoFile .","Though Wyoming only learned last week it will receive $205 million in federal rural health funds this year, the state doesn’t have a lot of time to idle over the money, Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson explained to lawmakers Tuesday.
That’s because Wyoming risks blowing an opportunity for $800 million in additional program funds if it does not fully spend the initial allotment, fails to implement the proposed policy actions in its application or goes rogue with other measures, according to the health department. 
“The Trump administration has been very clear with us that anything outside of these approved purposes that are within our application risks clawback from the federal government,” Johansson told the Joint Appropriations Committee during a Tuesday budget hearing.
The health department needs legislative action to advance some of its rural health plans with steps like approving funding expenditures and drafting a bill that would create a permanent, investment-generated revenue fund. 
So in a roundabout way, the federal funds are applying pressure on lawmakers to advance multiple initiatives aimed at supporting health care access in the state. And those include some measures that Wyoming’s small-government conservatives are wary of — like a state-run health insurance plan.
Committee Chairman Rep. John Bear of Gillette, who is a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, criticized that insurance proposal in earlier talks. On Tuesday, he paid the department a barbed compliment. 
“You all have done an excellent job of, I’m going to call it, twisting the arm of the federal government, to get this thing through,” he said. “Stuff that I think our staff and us were kind of surprised that you were able to get accomplished. So, well done in that regard.” 
Regardless, lawmakers will move forward on related actions, Bear said. 
“We certainly are taking this up as a matter of legislative action, so we’ll be working on this, and we’ll keep in touch with you to make sure we get it right,” he said. 
Wyoming’s award
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. 
The application process for states unfolded rapidly. In Wyoming, Department of Health staff held stakeholder conferences and 11 public meetings starting in September to gather input. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. Staff prepared an 84-page application and submitted it by the Nov. 5 deadline.

The application proposed an array of initiatives to bolster health care. They include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to boost the industry.
Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Dec. 29 that all 50 states will receive awards in 2026 under the program. Wyoming got $5 million more than it requested and received the second-largest award per capita, behind Alaska. 
Now, the work begins. In Wyoming, it will require drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. On Tuesday, health department staff came before the appropriations committee with an outline of where they think money could be best spent and a draft bill to establish the perpetuity fund. 
A path to sustainability 
Even among health care advocates who view the federal program as a major opportunity for Wyoming, there has been concern about the temporary nature of the funds not being able to fix long-term problems here. 
To address that issue, Wyoming proposed the establishment of the “Wyoming Health Transformation Perpetuity” — an actively managed investment account designed to generate long-term revenue. 
“The state stands to receive over a billion dollars through this program,” Johansson said Tuesday. “That’s a lot of money, and that’s something we take seriously. And so what we hope you see designed into our application is a priority around how to sustain that.”

The perpetuity vehicle would allow the state to stretch the federal benefits into the future to meaningfully address some of Wyoming’s historically intractable health care challenges, Johansson said, such as hospital and EMS viability and workforce retention. 
The bill draft would establish both the fund and rules for how the money is managed and used. 
Johansson emphasized that this specific part of the proposal can unlock a great deal of potential.  
“I know I sound like a used-car salesman here,” he told lawmakers, but “I think this could be truly transformative to some of the problems we have in our rural communities with health care. The idea is that we invest a smaller amount each year, so that over time, instead of five years of benefits, we’re going to accrue decades of benefits.”
There will also be some time-limited funds, Johansson said, which would be allocated to one-time grant programs related to technology adoption, integrated primary care and exercise and diet promotion. 
The appropriations committee is scheduled to revisit the perpetuity bill during its Jan. 15 meeting. 
BearCare
The proposal in Wyoming’s application that has drawn the most attention is the state-run public catastrophic insurance plan. 
As proposed, the plan, dubbed “BearCare,” would cover health care emergencies, such as a car crash or a bear attack, for dues-paying members. The department has pitched it as low-premium, high-deductible coverage that could be useful for major health emergencies, but doesn’t cover typical care.
Gov. Mark Gordon lauded the proposal in his budget letter, calling it “an innovative, but basic, health benefit plan that offers individuals and small businesses a practical alternative to costly ObamaCare insurance.”
Appropriations lawmakers were skeptical the first time BearCare came up in a meeting in early December, and retained wariness Tuesday. 
“We have the state stepping in and competing with private business on an unfair level,” said Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan. “And I’ve always been of the impression that it was the responsibility of the state to provide a level playing field so that anybody who wanted to build a business could build a business. So philosophically, I have a real problem right there.”

However, the plan also emerges as thousands of Wyomingites are facing huge spikes in health insurance costs with the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax subsidies. 
The proposal is not designed to replace an Affordable Care Act Plan, Johansson said.
Instead, he said, “it’s an alternative, in a way, that is a very different type of product that says, ‘if you are choosing to go uninsured as an individual, here is something at a lower cost that would protect you against those larger financial issues.’”
The concept, he continued, “was intriguing enough to the federal government, to the Trump administration, to say, ‘hey, while all this is going on with these expiring ACA subsidies …  here’s one state that’s at least considering an alternative to cover this.’”
He added that the BearCare proposal is a very small component of the state’s application and proposed budget — it would require about 1.4% of the overall allocation. 
However, he said, lawmakers will have the final say. 
“I’ll state unequivocally, we will not stand up that program without legislative authorization,” Johansson said.

Tim Sheehy, Rep. Ryan Zinke, and Rep. Troy Downing, as well as Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman — after signing H.J.Res. 104, rolling back a BLM rule which prohibited future coal leasing in eastern Montana. There are many good reasons our government is based on three “separate but equal branches.”  The men who wrote our Constitution 250 years ago had just fought a bloody war against an incredibly powerful monarch whose empire was based on extracting wealth in all its forms from merciless colonial exploitation of weaker nations. 
Few expected the victory of those brave men and women that gave birth to a new nation.  A nation of people free from the dictates of a monarch – and designed to preserve that freedom through carefully crafted “checks and balances” that would assure no one branch of government could trample the people or their Constitution underfoot. 
Yet now those checks and balances have been abandoned in favor of so-called “loyalty” to one political party over the long-standing mandate to ensure the branches of government remain separate and diligent in their primary function to serve the people and govern true to the Constitution. 
The excesses of one-party rule have long been known from the actual history of what has happened here in Montana — and now in the nation — when one party dominates all three branches of government.  In short, the checks and balances on which this nation was founded disappear into the sordid hole of party politics. 
When a president decides to become a Mad Emperor, it is the Legislative branch – Congress – which is charged with countering actions that abuse and ignore the rule of domestic and international laws and make a mockery of Constitutional governance. 
But when Congress is cowed into submission, that fealty to the Constitution, which all members swear to uphold in their Oath of Office, is sacrificed — not for the benefit the populace, but for the benefit of a political party and its brutal leader.
Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff, plainly laid out his vision for how the world, and our nation, should work.  Namely, by what he called the “iron law of power, control, and dominance.”  
Of course you won’t find that “law” anywhere but in Miller’s fevered mind.  And it’s a long ways from participatory democracy and the duty of Congress to check the extremes of the Executive Branch. 
Unfortunately, Congress, and Montana’s entire congressional delegation, are complicit in that dereliction of duty and violation of their Oath of Office. 
Given that three of Montana’s four members of Congress are veterans, it seems they have confused being in the military – where the “Commander in Chief” gives the orders and they obey – and being in Congress, which is specifically charged with serving the people, not whomever sits in the Oval Office.
That distinction is critical to the functioning of the nation which, by most measures, isn’t doing all that well right now as citizens struggle to feed, clothe and shelter themselves and our families.  
Add to that the wide international condemnation being directed to the actions of an out-of-control president whose avarice now extends to openly confiscating the resources of sovereign nations, deposing their leaders through military force, and threatening traditional allies with similar actions in violation of international law. 
There’s still time to bring honor to the positions Montana’s congressional delegation holds.  But that requires acknowledging that Stephen Miller’s “iron law” doesn’t exist in law or the Constitution and has no place among the community of nations in the 21st Century.  
Your sworn duty is not to the president and his toadies, it’s to “We the People” — and that call to duty could not be more pressing as our democracy now hangs by the thinnest of threads.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G77nYVkWgAAXcCZ-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 06:57:01.588651

Feral horses have long been part of the Wyoming landscape, but not without consequences for the land and wildlife, writes columnist Walt Gasson.
The post And the horses we rode in on appeared first on WyoFile .","My grandson says I’m a sucker for a flashy horse. He should know. He was with me, branding calves with a friend, when I got completely carried away watching a Tobiano paint horse with feet like a dancer. He was there as well when I fell in love with a big gray foxtrotter with the smoothest gait I’ve ever seen. I plead guilty as charged. I have always loved horses, especially beautiful horses.

Opinion

But if you go back a couple of generations, the horses that my family rode were far from beautiful. The little rangy, hammer-headed mustangs that my grandfather Walt rode didn’t come from some posh horse sale or from some fancy bloodline. They came from the desert, on the business end of a lariat. They were feral horses, perfectly adapted for a good life in a hard country. They were survivors, and their descendants have remained such to this day. 
I do not remember a time in my life when feral horses weren’t present. They were there at Elk Butte and Little Sandy Creek when I was barely tall enough to see out of the pickup window. There were feral horses in Salt Wells Creek and over toward Pine Mountain, south of Rock Springs. There were feral horses near Oregon Buttes and down toward Steamboat Mountain. Never a lot at one time, usually a stud with a small bunch of mares and their offspring. They were skittish, for the most part, and quick to put some distance between themselves and humans. They were iconic, in a way — very much a part of the wild desert country my family called home.
But over time, things changed. Beginning in the 1970s, we began to see more feral horses in more places. You could read brands on some — somebody’s pet that they couldn’t afford to keep and couldn’t bear to put down. I even saw a feral mule east of Continental Peak one day. And every year, there were more. It was apparent that they were fast becoming a problem. And the problem remains to this day.
Here are a few things we know about feral horses:

Wyoming has a lot of free-ranging horses. We’re second only to Nevada in feral horse numbers. We have 16 herd management areas, mostly in southwestern Wyoming and the Bighorn Basin. 


They’re not wildlife. They’re domestic horses released to the wild accidentally or on purpose, now feral. Any other origin story for them is fantasy. Multiple species of horses existed in North America, but they’ve been extinct for at least 10,000 years.


They’re physically resilient and adaptable. Their anatomy (prehensile lips, narrow muzzle, long legs, single-chamber stomach) and their ability to shift what they eat in response to changing conditions (drought, severe winters, etc.) make them successful competitors with native wildlife, like sage grouse, pronghorn, mule deer, elk and bighorn sheep.


They’re behaviorally resilient and adaptable as well. When resources like water are plentiful, they don’t spend a lot of energy defending those resources. But when those same resources are scarce, they aggressively defend their territories, limiting access to resources by those same native wildlife species.


Their numbers were kept in check for more than a century by harvest from Indigenous people, and later by ranchers and other rural folks for their own purposes. Stockmen across the interior west captured young horses for domestication and shipped other captive feral horses to market for slaughter.


The Wild Free‐Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 was a game-changer. With the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service tasked with the responsibility to manage feral horses on their lands, free-ranging horse numbers have risen to approximately three times the appropriate management levels established.


At current population levels, feral horses are damaging habitat for many species of native wildlife. As the impacts of climate changes continue, this damage will increase.

Out there on the ground, the future looks grim for both these hardy critters and the habitat they depend upon. Feral horse numbers on the range continue to increase. Holding facilities are full. Adoption programs account for only a small number of horses annually. The federal agencies have turned to off-range sites, usually on private lands, where the owner contracts to take a given number of horses for a given time and receives compensation. There are now almost as many free-ranging horses off-range as there are in the wild. Meanwhile, free-ranging horse numbers continue to rise.
It would be easy to pin this on the BLM and Forest Service. Wyoming folks reflexively blame the feds, when given the opportunity. But I don’t think they are the problem. The problem is the Wild Free‐Roaming Horses and Burros Act. It has been around for over 50 years. The original intent was to protect feral horses and burros from abuse and ensure a place for viable populations of them on the public lands of the West. By any measure, that mission has long been accomplished. 
It’s time for a change out on the range. Three simple recommendations:

Reduce horse numbers to the existing appropriate management levels by executive order, if necessary. Those levels were developed collaboratively, using the best science available at the time. 


If we need to change appropriate management levels, change them. And monitor population levels closely, using the best available science. 


Increase emphasis on sterilization of free-roaming horses to keep populations at appropriate management levels.

This is a stewardship issue. It’s not about the romance of the animals. It’s not about the feelings of their advocates or their critics. It’s about both the horses and the native wildlife. Most importantly, it’s about the native landscapes of the West we hold in trust for future generations.

(Photo by Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)The massive federal tax and spending package, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” approved by Congress in July will impact state budgets next year — but less than a week ahead of the Idaho legislative session and the beginning of state budget-setting, lawmakers are not sure the extent of cuts the bill could result in. 
The federal tax changes could reduce Idaho’s revenue significantly in the near-term. However, it’s unclear by how much, as recent estimates cited by several state officials range from $115 million to around $400 million. 
Asked about discrepancies between estimates, officials cited factors such as complexity of federal versus state tax laws, unanswered questions about definitions in the federal bill regarding some of the provisions, and the potential for people to report their income in new ways to pay lower taxes.

“I think it’s somewhere between $180 million and maybe $240 million, somewhere in there, and probably closer to $220 million. But that’s just a guess, like everybody else is doing,” House Speaker Mike Moyle said at a press conference Thursday. “And until we know those definitions and how it’s going to apply, we just have to guess.” 
The state is facing a projected $40 million deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and an estimated $600 million to $1 billion deficit for the coming fiscal year.
Little will submit his proposed budget on Jan. 12, the first day of the 2026 legislative session. 
A spokesperson for Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s told the Idaho Capital Sun that the governor “is proactively assessing the impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill and coordinating closely with state agencies to ensure Idaho remains fiscally responsible and well-positioned moving forward.”

 Estimated cost of federal tax conformity in Idaho vary widely 

Idaho lawmakers typically approve an annual tax conformity bill, which aligns Idaho’s tax codes with the federal Internal Revenue Code, early in the year with limited fanfare or debate. However, with the major federal policy change, this year’s vote will include decisions regarding new tax policies such as no taxes on workers’ tips, no taxes on overtime for some workers, and no taxes on interest on auto loans. All of these decisions may reduce Idaho’s revenue. 
The Idaho State Tax Commission as of Jan. 8 has estimated the state would lose between $115.6 million and $193.3 million of revenue the first year with almost all the federal charges, according to an analysis received through a public records request. 
In July, the nonprofit national tax policy organization the Tax Foundation estimated Idaho would see a  $284 million cut in revenue if lawmakers adopt all Big Beautiful Bill tax changes. Another report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy noted that the Tax Foundation’s estimate did not include provisions related to bonus depreciation, which is one area of the tax code where Idaho does not follow federal policies. 
Idaho legislators hope to set revenue projection early to tackle budget, revenue shortfalls

If the state did opt to re-align itself with federal bonus depreciation, the cost could be as high as $435.4 million, the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy estimated. 
Moyle said Thursday he’s seen estimates as high as $800 million, but did not say where he saw that estimate. Earlier this week, Moyle told the Sun the cost could be closer to $400 million. 
Little said at the same event Thursday that his office would unveil its own calculation but didn’t elaborate on what it would be. Asked why the spread among predictions was so large, the governor responded, “it’s really quite complicated.” 
The top House Democrat, Minority Leader Rep. Ilana Rubel, Boise, also emphasized the uncertainty of the potential number, but expressed more concern about it. 
“Frankly, it’s a dynamic situation, because people have some flex and how they can characterize compensation,” Rubel said. “And there’s going to be a lot of incentive under this to characterize things that used to be salary as tips … I don’t like jumping off ledges where I can’t see where the bottom is.” 
 Idaho lawmakers need to agree on revenue number to set budget

Idaho’s Constitution requires the state to balance a budget, but to do that, lawmakers must estimate the revenue it will receive to balance it against. Whatever decision is made on tax conformity will impact that revenue number. 
Republican legislative leaders on Thursday expressed support for adopting most of the federal tax changes, although maybe not all. 
Moyle said “there’s no way in heck” he would oppose the changes such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tip income and the increased senior senior deduction. Moyle said that because the state left a buffer in its budget last year, that the budget would be “in good shape.” 
“We’re going to have to guess, which I hate to say, but that’s what we’re going to do,” Moyle said. “We’re going to guess what the number (is), and we’re going to walk out of here with a balanced budget.” 
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate on Thursday expressed much more skepticism about the cost of conforming. 
“I wish we wouldn’t even be in the position that we had to question conformity. We always conform,” Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said. 
Rubel noted the state is already facing a projected budget deficit. 
“The first rule of holes is when you’re in one, stop digging,” Rubel. 
 What are other states doing to prepare? 

Other states are facing revenue reductions as well. 
In early December, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox included in his proposed budget an estimated revenue cut of $500 million in the next two years from federal tax conformity, Utah News Dispatch reported. 
Cox announced the state intended to comply with the tax changes. 
Under Trump tax cuts, Utah won’t collect $500 million in income taxes in 2026, 2027

Pew Research in late November published an analysis of different states’ approaches to preparing for the impact of the federal legislation, which is also known as “H.R. 1.” 
“Special sessions have been one way (states are preparing),” said Justin Theal, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. “Another way has been, state leaders really leaning on special committees and task forces that existed prior to the passage of H.R. 1, but have all of a sudden become front and center in terms of really informing what the impact of these federal changes will be on the state’s overall fiscal trajectory.” 
New Mexico had already established its Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee, Theal said, but later opted to use the subcommittee to evaluate the federal budget package’s potential impact. Vermont had an existing task force that in July published a report on declining federal transfers, and although it was compiled before the passage of the federal budget bill, leaders there are using the report to inform their response, Theal said. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in August called lawmakers back into a special session to address the estimated $800 million budget shortfall from the tax provisions in the federal budget package, Colorado Newsline reported. 
Across the state, Theal said he both saw these proactive approaches as well as some states opting to wait and see. He said he saw some states using stress tests similar to those used by large banks to understand how a big shock to the system may affect their ability to balance budgets. 
“Traditionally, those things are used for events like a recession,” Theal said, “but states are increasingly using them to kind of game out what a sudden loss of federal funds might mean.”

Thursday’s candlelight vigil was at least the third event held in Nashville to honor Good a day after her killing was captured in widely circulated videos. Scores of similar vigils and protests took place across the nation. 
“We grieve with them as they grieve the loss of a neighbor and loved one,” Rev. Eric Mailey, pastor of Edgehill United Methodist Church, told the crowd gathered after sunset.  “No matter where you are, everyone deserves to be safe.”

But like others who spoke at the Nashville vigil – among them, faith and community leaders, and immigrant advocates  – Mailey called Good’s death an act of political violence and laid blame on the Trump administration for “perpetuating and normalizing” terror on the nation’s streets.
“Until we get them out of our communities, the violence will continue to escalate,” he said. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has characterized Good’s death as the result of a justifiable and defensive shooting. In a post on X, the department accused Good of being a domestic terrorist who “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to run down ICE agents. 
But the Trump administration has provided no support for its allegations of domestic terrorism against Good, and bystander video appears to contradict its claims of how the incident unfolded. 
Elected officials in Tennessee also weighed in Thursday. 
U.S. Congressman Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Memphis, called the incident “deeply disturbing.”  
Cohen said the incident “raises serious concerns for communities like Memphis,” where hundreds of outside law enforcement officers, including ICE agents and the Tennessee National Guard, were dispatched on the president’s orders to “restore law and order.”
“We grieve with them as they grieve the loss of a neighbor and loved one,” Pastor Eric Mailey of Edgehill Methodist Church told the crowd in Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
State Rep. Justin Pearson, also a Memphis Democrat, called Good’s death “horrifying, tragic and a direct consequence of the authoritarian policies of the Trump administration.”
“This is what happens when our government chooses to intimidate its people and treat entire communities like suspects under the guise of ‘restoring order,’” he said. 
In a statement on X, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, called upon Americans to “pray for our ICE patriots.”
“If you put an ICE agent in mortal danger, self-defense is JUSTIFIED,” he wrote.
Thursday’s vigil was organized by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, Nashville Indivisible, SEUI Local 205, Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood, Conexion Americas, Tennessee Justice for our Neighbors and others.

Jeff Landry, center, as Landry leaves the House Chamber after speaking on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry has the power to appoint three more members to the Louisiana Board of Ethics this year, giving him control over the majority of the entity that enforces campaign finance and government transparency laws. 
Three of the 15 board members’ terms expired Jan. 1. The governor controls all seats now open to new appointees. He selected five new members last year. Appointing three more would give him a slim majority of eight members. 

Outgoing board members Alfred “Butch” Speer and Anne Banos, appointees of former Gov. John Bel Edwards, stepped down in December. The term for member Jacqueline Scott, also an Edwards appointee, has also ended, but she plans to remain on the board until Landry replaces her, state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said Thursday. 
Landry’s office said announcements about new ethics board members might come Friday. Bordelon said the ethics staff hadn’t received notice of any new appointments yet.

Landry, who has clashed with the board in the past, has more control over its members than his predecessors. In 2024, he pushed through a law that reworked the board selection process to give the governor more influence. 
He also expanded the board from 11 to 15 members last year, with the number of seats the governor gets to pick going from seven to nine. State lawmakers appoint the remaining six members, up from four under the previous structure. 
More significantly, the governor and legislators get to appoint members directly to the board, although the governor’s appointees are required to receive state Senate confirmation. Previously, the governor and lawmakers could only select ethics board members from a list of nominees provided by leaders at Louisiana’s private colleges and universities. These college leaders were included in the selection process to insulate the board members from political pressure, but Landry removed that attempt at a firewall. 
The change upset government transparency advocates, who said it weakened the ethics board’s independence. 
As a concession to those concerns, there is a recommendation in the new law — but not a requirement — that the board be made up of five retired judges, five other retired elected officials and five people who have never served in public office.

The ethics board currently includes three retired judges: Vanessa Whipple, John Crigler and Joel Davis. Three retired elected officials — Jason Amato, Mike Huval and Rick Nowlin — also hold seats. All except Huval, a Louisiana House of Representatives appointee, were chosen by Landry last year. 
Until recently, Landry and the ethics board were in a standoff over the governor’s failure to disclose trips he had taken on private planes owned by campaign donors while he held public office. 
In September, the ethics board dropped charges it filed against Landry in 2023, when he was attorney general, for failing to disclose trips he took on a donor’s private plane. In exchange, Landry paid a $900 fine and publicly admitted to 19 instances in which he had accepted rides on private planes without publicly reporting them. 
In the past, the board has also told Landry in private letters to stop using money from his political accounts to pay off his vehicle and a Washington, D.C., gym membership. But earlier this year, the governor and lawmakers approved a law that now allow for some of this previously restricted spending.

[…],"Springdale-based Tyson Foods has said the company will not renew contracts with Northwest Arkansas poultry growers in response to ongoing litigation regarding poultry litter polluting the Illinois River. (Photo by Evey Weisblat/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge fining Tyson Foods and other large poultry companies for polluting the Illinois River is part of a decades-long legal fight that prompted the Springdale-based company to deem the watershed “no longer a hospitable place to do business.”  
The declaration was surprising for a company whose history is deeply entrenched in the region. Tyson is Springdale’s largest single employer, and its fingerprints are everywhere. Employees can shop for discounted meats and ready-to-eat frozen meals at the company store. A vintage neon sign depicting a chick hatching from an egg adorns the brick facade of Tyson’s original headquarters. Signs featuring Tyson’s red and yellow logo are inescapable throughout its hometown.
The city recently handed Tyson a 50% tax break for its $127 million plan to revive a shuttered Springdale poultry plant. At the same time, Tyson threatened to stop contracting with local poultry farmers because of the looming threat of legal fines.   
The tax write-off and Tyson’s simultaneous decision to withdraw from local contracts shows the balancing act the nation’s largest processed chicken manufacturer is performing as it fights a costly environmental lawsuit. And it explains why locals are wary of directly blaming the company for its stance.
Report outlines Nebraska financial hit from Tyson plant exit

In Arkansas, Tyson dominates the market through contracts with broiler farmers who raise chickens to process at its facilities. Without Tyson, many growers in the watershed, which includes northwest Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, could face immediate bankruptcy, a scenario that played out recently in Missouri and central Arkansas when Tyson abruptly closed processing plants there, leaving farmers without a buyer. 
Tyson’s decision to step back from contracts in the region came roughly three weeks prior to a Dec. 19 ruling, which ordered the poultry giant to clean up decades of phosphorus pollution that has damaged the Illinois River watershed as a result of chicken litter being applied in large quantities to broiler farms. 
About two weeks before the ruling, the Arkansas Farm Bureau held an emergency meeting with over 100 poultry growers and state lawmakers from Arkansas and Oklahoma in response to Tyson’s comments. In a statement, Bureau President Dan Wright warned the loss of contracts could threaten the livelihoods of poultry farmers throughout the watershed.
Jerry Moyer, owner of PLR Farms in Lincoln, said he will be left with $200,000 in debt if Tyson does not renew his contracts when they expire in 2028. 
“There’s growers that will have $4-6 million worth of debt to be paid and that’s devastating to their families,” Moyer said in a Dec. 3 video. “The growers that are left with large debt, they’re going to file bankruptcy and walk away.”   
The bureau, however, isn’t blaming Tyson over the loss of contracts. The blame is being laid squarely on Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, thanks to the 20-year-old lawsuit he has aggressively pursued an end to over the past three years. 
Two decades, one lawsuit 
The Oklahoma v. Tyson Foods litigation began in 2005 when the state sued large poultry companies for disposing tons of phosphorus-rich chicken litter on lands that drained into the Illinois River watershed. 
Drummond oversaw settlement talks after Oklahoma U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled in favor of the state in 2023, determining the poultry companies were responsible for polluting the river basin and causing widespread algae blooms that have not improved. The companies, including Tyson, Cargill, George’s, Simmons Foods and Cal-Maine, challenged that ruling, but lost again when Frizzell reaffirmed the court’s initial findings but did not issue a final remedy.   
Following failed settlement talks, Frizzell issued a final judgement Dec. 19. The ruling mandates a comprehensive cleanup plan lasting at least 30 years, overseen by a court-appointed “special master” and funded entirely by the poultry companies with a starting balance of $10 million. Tyson was ordered to pay the largest share of $420,000 in fines levied for past violations, and the decision places new limits on waste per acre.

The judgment is less severe than what Drummond — who is running for governor in 2026 — proposed in July, when he asked for more than $100 million in penalties. Drummond’s proposal was met with intense backlash, and the Oklahoma and Arkansas Farm Bureaus urged Drummond to soften his demands in light of Tyson’s threats to pull grower contracts. 
“The livelihoods of Arkansas and Oklahoma poultry farmers within the Illinois River Watershed are being threatened by an extreme overreach by the Oklahoma attorney general,” Wright said in a statement. Oklahoma Farm Bureau President Stacy Simunek urged Drummond to “go back to the drawing board to reach a reasonable settlement.” 
Drummond has faced escalating pressure from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who ahead of the ruling urged the AG to settle and accused Drummond of “prioritizing the interests of out-of-state trial lawyers” over Oklahoma farmers.
Tyson said in late November it would halt new contracts in the watershed, blaming Drummond for creating a legal environment that made the region inhospitable to business. The poultry giant said it would honor existing contracts, but not extend them beyond their current terms.
Drummond called Tyson’s threats a “coordinated misinformation campaign” designed to avoid taking responsibility for decades of pollution.
“Not one single farmer has been sued by the state, but these corporations continue to hide behind a false narrative, using hardworking farm families as human shields to avoid accountability,” Drummond said in a news release.    
Tyson’s shiny new investment
Just 24 hours before declaring the region too risky for business, Tyson secured a massive deal to expand its operations in Springdale with the acquisition of a turkey processing plant.  
The deal relies on Act 9 industrial development bonds, where the city takes technical ownership of the plant and leases it back to Tyson through a PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement. This arrangement allows the company to pay discounted “rent” on its $127 million investment rather than full property taxes for 10 years, after which time Tyson will take ownership of the plant. Based on Washington County property tax rates, a 50% reduction and the project’s $127 million valuation, the Advocate estimates the deal will save Tyson more than $6.5 million over the next decade.   
Springdale could not verify these projected savings. Springdale Deputy Chief of Staff Anna McKinney declined to comment when asked if the city had independently calculated Tyson’s expected tax savings, or what the city’s expected property tax revenue would be before approving the deal. Instead, she referred the questions to the company. 
Tyson accounting executive Jan Nash told McKinney in a Dec. 10 email that the company’s communications team “prefer that we do not comment on the estimated savings.” Nash also noted “that Tyson has closed on the property, which is our initial investment.”    
Tyson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.
City officials were content to move forward with the deal based solely on verbal assurances from Tyson. In response to a public records request, the only document the city could produce besides the public agreement documents was a letter to Springdale’s mayor and city council from Springdale Public Schools Superintendent Jared Cleveland, expressing support for the bond deal. While acknowledging that tax exemptions “must be used judiciously,” Cleveland said Tyson’s leadership had assured him the arrangement would “meet or exceed” existing property tax revenues for the school district.  
He described Springdale’s relationship to Tyson as “symbiotic.”  
“The history of Springdale is written in tandem with the history of Tyson Foods,” Cleveland wrote. “We understand a fundamental truth: A strong Tyson Foods means a strong Springdale, and a strong Springdale creates a thriving School District.” 
That relationship runs so deep that city officials again deferred to the company when asked to explain their confidence in the deal, given that it lacks any provisions which would protect the city’s tax base if Tyson were to suddenly jump ship or not create the jobs it promised. 
Tyson would “be better equipped to answer” these questions, McKinney said in a Dec. 29 email. Tyson has not responded to the questions forwarded by the city.

The plant Tyson bought was formerly owned by Cargill, but the company shuttered it in August. The 350,000-square-foot facility, located on 45 acres in Springdale’s industrial corridor, had operated for over 50 years and employed about 1,000 people, Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse said. In a Dec 5. interview, he described the closure as a “punch in the gut” and said he was relieved when Tyson said it was interested in buying the facility through a tax-free bond.
“Nothing’s really a no-brainer, but I thought this was as close to a no-brainer from a city’s perspective because the city is not on the hook for any of these bonds,” Sprouse said. “This will all be on Tyson.” 
Tyson officials proposed renovating the Cargill plant and retrofitting it into a chicken packaging facility. Nathan McKay, Tyson’s president of poultry, said the company plans major capital investments over the next three years to upgrade equipment. They would hire about 200 employees in the first few years of operation, and gradually add more.  
The Springdale City Council approved the bond, and Drummond cited the acquisition as evidence Tyson was bluffing about withdrawing from contracts in the watershed.
“Oklahomans deserve better than corporate intimidation tactics from a company that has repeatedly shown it prioritizes profits over people and environmental responsibility,” Drummond said.
Sprouse said he had not spoken with Tyson about the company’s threats to pull back from local contracts before or after the city council approved the tax incentives. 
“I know well enough to know that’s not something they want to do,” Sprouse said. At the same time, he pleaded ignorance about other aspects of Tyson’s business strategy, stating he “would have no clue” about Drummond’s claims Tyson was bluffing. 
Sprouse said he hopes local growers can still operate and indicated he trusted Tyson’s decision-making process. 
 “I don’t know what all’s going into those decisions, and I’ll trust those in charge to decide what they need to do,” he said.
The path forward
Drummond left open the door to negotiations that could offer “more flexibility and certainty” than the judge’s plan. He cautioned against appealing the ruling noting it would only prolong the decades-long legal proceedings. 
“A robust poultry industry and clean water can and must coexist,” Drummond said in a press release. “I remain committed to working with the poultry companies toward a resolution.”
Officials decry judge’s ruling against poultry companies in Oklahoma and Arkansas

Attorneys for Tyson and the other poultry firms have asked the judge to stay his ruling as they appeal it. 
Arkansas Farm Bureau’s president lambasted the judge’s decision, arguing the farming standards imposed by his ruling represent an “arbitrary benchmark” that will force large poultry companies to withdraw from the watershed. 
“Ultimately, this ruling is a gross overreach and seeks to provide a solution to a problem that no longer exists,” Wright stated.
Arkansas and Oklahoma lawmakers, including Stitt, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and legislators representing Benton and Washington counties, also criticized Frizzell’s judgement. Sanders said the case has created “unnecessary harm” to poultry growers.
Save The Illinois River, an environmental stewardship group that was among the minority who praised the final judgment, said the poultry companies should be held responsible for polluting the watershed. 
“It’s time to quit playing politics and economically threatening our farmers, our communities, and the future of our children,” president Paul Rowsey said in a statement. “The time is now to act responsibly and remediate past transgressions and to mitigate future ones.”

(Courtesy of Denver Public Library Special Collections, X-23704)Though Colorado was on the verge of statehood in early 1876, it wouldn’t have a Capitol building for almost another 20 years. It fell to John Taffe, the territorial secretary, to rent two large rooms at a Lawrence Street building owned by the Odd Fellows fraternal order, a space praised by the Denver Times as “the best ever obtained for the Legislature (and) not more than ordinarily expensive.”
 

This story is part of Colorado at 150, featuring special reports on the people and history that define the state.


There was relatively little business for the Legislature, which consisted of a 13-seat upper chamber called the Council and a 26-seat House of Representatives, to transact during its 40-day session.
The territorial government collected about $90,000 a year in tax revenue, which was doled out to institutions like the penitentiary in Cañon City, the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind, and two new public colleges established in 1874, the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Among the session’s more controversial proposals was a bill to appropriate funds for a delegation to be sent to the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia later that year.
“If we had thirty or forty millions in our treasury we could as well splurge out with $20,000 as not. It would then be very well to send a committee of five or six who want to visit their friends in the east, and the Centennial, and have a good time at the expense of the territory,” a Denver correspondent wrote to the Pueblo Chieftain. “We are not yet financially situated to indulge in any very extravagant movements in a Centennial direction, or in any other direction.”

But in January 1876 there were, as the Chieftain put it, “three houses” in session in Denver, and the third and most important body met a few blocks away, at the corner of 15th and Blake streets, on the third floor of the First National Bank building. The chambers of Colorado’s constitutional convention were adorned for the occasion with American flags, landscapes of both Pikes Peak and Long’s Peak, and portraits of Washington, Lincoln, President Ulysses S. Grant and frontiersman Kit Carson.
In December the convention had organized itself into committees and hired its officers, including secretaries and sergeants-at-arms. The selection of Clay Forbes, a Black man, as the convention’s fireman, tasked with keeping the hall warm, was characterized by The Rocky Mountain News as “an earnest of a good bill of rights in the new constitution.” David F. Wilkins of Las Animas County was appointed as the convention’s Spanish interpreter, continuing a practice that had begun in the territorial assembly.
On Jan. 8, Gov. John Routt, the members of the three houses and other territorial leaders held a grand joint banquet at Denver’s Guard Hall, where nearly 300 guests paid three dollars apiece to enjoy “chef-d’oeuvres of French cookery” prepared by Jacques Charpiot, proprietor of the Cafe Denver.
“More elaborate preparation for satisfying the inner needs of man was probably never seen on such an extensive scale in the territory,” reported the News, “and the corps of waiters, who were to be the Ganymedes of the occasion, formed quite a small army.”
An anonymous correspondent in the Chieftain offered a somewhat less poetic account of banquet-goers who “shoveled good grub into the yawning caverns beneath their noses with their knives, thus endangering their heads.”
“Stomachs accustomed to bacon and beans and chili colorado yearned to be filled with the good things prepared by the Denver cooks,” said the Chieftain, “and some of those inured to the attacks of ten cent whisky gaped to receive the generous Jersey champagne which it was hoped would be forthcoming.”
Debate over women’s suffrage
County elections for delegates to the constitutional convention, held in October 1875, had given Republicans a comfortable 25-14 majority over Democrats. Territorial voters would get the final say on the constitution in a referendum later in 1876, but first the convention’s 39 delegates would hash out their disagreements — sometimes, but not always, along party lines — on matters including public education, taxation of church property, the means of selecting the state judiciary and much more.
But the issue that would attract more attention than any other was whether the 38th state’s constitution would be the first to guarantee women the right to vote. The women’s suffrage movement had made a crucial breakthrough in the Wyoming Territory in 1869, when the Legislature of Colorado’s northern neighbor had granted women the franchise and the right to hold public office.
With the constitutional assembly underway, a women’s suffrage convention was held at Denver’s Unity Church, at 17th and California streets, on Jan. 10 and 11, 1876. The timing was no accident: National suffrage groups were determined to seize the opportunity presented by the framing of a new state’s constitution, and the convention was organized by leading suffragists like Margaret W. Campbell of Massachusetts, who had arrived in Denver in December and would remain in Colorado for much of the year to advocate for the cause.
Letters addressed to Campbell in Denver from fellow suffragist Lucy Stone, editor of The Woman’s Journal, are preserved in the Library of Congress. Writing to Campbell ahead of the convention, Stone invoked the commemoration of the nation’s Centennial as she noted the framers of Colorado’s constitution had “the rare opportunity to achieve by peaceful means what our revolutionary fathers fought seven years to obtain.”

“If it was tyranny to tax the colonists a century ago and deny them representation, it is tyranny to do the same to women now,” Stone wrote. “No part of the constitution of Colorado in this Centennial year can be more appropriate, or have more historic credit a hundred years hence, than that part which shall secure for women the right to a voice in making the laws they will be required to obey.”
Some prominent Coloradans still treated such ideas with mocking contempt. A Chieftain correspondent, identified only as “H.,” denounced the “farcical drama” staged by the “disciples of Beecher,” a reference to the prominent family of abolitionists and suffragists.
“Let the devil hide his diminished head, the whole world is running to isms — dogmatism, atheism, pantheism, freeloveism, cannibalism, womansuffrageism, mormonism, spiritualism and a hundred other isms equally heathenish and fallacious,” he wrote.
In many circles, however, such attitudes were going out of fashion. It was more common for the influential men who published Colorado’s territorial newspapers, including William Byers of The Rocky Mountain News, to profess sympathy with the women’s suffrage movement while arguing that such “advanced ideas” were ahead of their time. Echoing arguments made in opposition to civil rights movements throughout American history, Byers urged the suffragists to “bide their time,” casting doubt on the electoral viability of a state constitution that granted women the vote.
“Haste must be made slowly in this matter. It will not do to cause the constitution to carry too heavy a load,” the News argued on Jan. 8. “If weighed down with provisions, the justice and propriety of which are not recognized by the community as a class, but merely by a particular portion of perhaps partial revolutionary tendencies, the constitution will never become a fact.”
In another familiar complaint, an editorial in the Chieftain blamed Campbell and other “chronic agitators imported from the states” for stirring up trouble in the territory.
“The arguments urged in support of the measure may be true to a certain degree, and would doubtless be productive of much good if put in actual practice,” the Chieftain wrote. “But at the same time the impression seems to prevail, that female suffrage can wait a few years, or at least until other and more important questions are determined.”
The moderates got their wish. Colorado’s 1876 constitution granted women a limited right to vote in school board elections, but deferred the broader question of suffrage to the new state’s Legislature and the results of a future voter referendum. After several unsuccessful attempts, Colorado finally became the second state in the nation to adopt women’s suffrage in 1893.

(Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)LINCOLN — The Democratic National Committee has threatened to sue Nebraska over what it describes as a potential agreement with the Justice Department to require election officials to remove any allegedly ineligible voters identified during federal reviews of state voter rolls.
The letter, obtained by the Examiner, set to be sent Friday morning, says the DNC wants to “ensure” the state and the secretary of state are aware of federal constraints on voter registration list maintenance and wants the state not to pursue any “unlawful removals from its official list of eligible voters in elections for federal office.” 
“The DNC sends this letter in the hope that the imminent violations … may still be avoided,” part of the letter to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen reads. “Nonetheless, the DNC stands ready to issue a formal notice should evidence of ongoing violations come to light. In the event that your office believes further conversations might help avoid a violation of federal law, I would be happy to discuss this matter with you or your staff.”

The letter, from DNC Litigation Director Daniel J. Freeman, outlines how the potential agreement would “violate” federal election law, pointing to the National Voter Registration Act. The DNC argues “a systematic purge” of registered voters would lead to “errors that remove registrants who remain eligible under state law.”
The DNC letter comes after the state secretary of state confirmed in court filings and to the Examiner that he “intends to release the state’s voter file to the federal government on Feb. 12, unless the court orders otherwise.” The court documents were part of a lawsuit by voter advocacy group Common Cause Nebraska, which says it aims to block the sharing of that voter data with the Department of Justice.

The group filed to seek a temporary restraining order on Wednesday over concerns that the court may not issue a final ruling before the secretary releases the data. 
The state agency also confirmed to the Examiner Thursday that it plans to hand over the data on Feb. 12. Federal officials have asked states for names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure voter registration rolls are accurate. 
Late last year, Stateline reported that the Justice Department sent a confidential draft agreement to more than a dozen states. A Justice Department official identified 11 states that had expressed an interest in the agreement during a federal court hearing in December, according to a transcript. Nebraska was one of the 11 that “expressed … a willingness to comply” with the DOJ agreement.  
The agreement, as reported, would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution. While the DOJ has demanded states’ voter rolls since last summer, the draft agreement offered the most detailed picture yet of how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
Some GOP states have declined or are pushing back against federal efforts to gather the data over privacy concerns. Critics have questioned the safety of letting any administration consolidate such voter data in one place. The federal government has sued two Democratic-run states for the information, the first legal challenge the department has brought against states to obtain the registration records.
Evnen, after getting guidance from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, said the state is “fine” with meeting the DOJ request, because Nebraska’s voter rolls are “complete and proper.”
A group of Nebraska lawmakers sent a letter to Evnen asking him to explain his “negotiations” with the federal government over the release of sensitive voter information last week. An agency spokesperson told the Examiner that Evnen has signed no agreement with the DOJ and wasn’t negotiating.

More than eight months after postponing a bill allowing school districts to refuse enrollment to children without legal immigration status, the House sponsor still awaits word on whether it could jeopardize federal funding.
House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland indicated this week he would revive the bill if the money isn’t in danger. 
House Speaker Cameron Sexton also said Thursday he wants to revive the bill, which would give school districts the option to check students to determine whether they have permanent legal documentation, then either block enrollment or charge tuition. 
Sexton said he’s not sure whether the U.S. Department of Education will opine on the matter, but after consulting with the White House over the past year he will roll out a package of immigration bills next week.
“I hope we bring it back in some form or another. We’ll see what that looks like,” Sexton said. “I would assume at some point we will get comfortable with whatever we want to do.”
The Senate measure requiring districts to check students’ immigration status and charge tuition passed in April 2025 on a 19-13 vote, but the House version got hung up on the potential of Tennessee losing more than a billion bucks for enacting a law that violates the constitutional requirement for schools to serve all students.
Breaking anti-discrimination laws could put another gaping hole in the state budget.
In the waning days of the 2025 session, Lamberth had Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic ask the U.S. Department of Education whether the state was putting the funding in jeopardy. Lamberth held the measure in the House after not receiving immediate word.
Tennessee asks feds whether state funds are jeopardized by immigrant student bill

Asked this week if he plans to revive House Bill 793, Lamberth tiptoed around the question.
“We are awaiting a definitive response from Secretary (Linda) McMahon’s office on whether Tennessee risks losing $1.1 billion in federal education funding. We remain in contact and are hopeful for a resolution,” he said in a statement.
Lamberth, a Portland Republican, said last year he would renew his effort based on the secretary’s response.
Lamberth and Sen. Bo Watson, who sponsored the Senate version, hoped passage would lead to a legal challenge that would reach the Supreme Court so it could revisit a 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe that established all children have a right to a public school education in the United States, regardless of immigration status.
Even if McMahon says the money isn’t at risk, the bill’s passage isn’t guaranteed.
It narrowly escaped the Senate where opponents, including Republicans, said lawmakers shouldn’t put children in the middle of a fight over immigration. 
Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin used a Bible verse to argue against blaming children for the acts of their parents. 
House members were more worried about losing money, though, and those concerns are likely to surface again in 2026, which is expected to be an even tighter budgeting year because of increased spending and revenue cuts extended in the form of business tax breaks and rebates.
Hallway talk at Cordell Hull, which isn’t quite worth a 25-cent cup of coffee (those don’t exist), says it remains up in the air again as lawmakers prepare to return next week to rattle the cages of Tennesseans.
Some semblance of sanity
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson renewed hope in the nation’s judiciary this week when he sentenced former Rep. Robin Smith to one year of probation rather than six months in prison for her role in a much-ballyhooed fraud case.
The move came after President Donald Trump pardoned former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who were set to go to prison for putting together a secretive campaign vendor called Phoenix Solutions to tap into state campaign mailer funds.
Smith hasn’t been able to get a pardon from Trump, which doesn’t seem quite fair. She remains a convicted felon after copping a plea to honest services fraud and testifying against Casada and Cothren while they get off hook, line and sinker.

Sure, Smith might have come up with the idea to go for “low-hanging fruit” with the state’s mailer program. But in this case, it took three to tango. Cothren did the nuts-and-bolts work of setting up Phoenix Solutions in New Mexico while Casada tried to play it cool. Smith and Casada encouraged fellow lawmakers to use Phoenix Solutions to send out taxpayer-funded constituent mailers, and Smith put pressure on state officials to pay up before they got wind of something fishy.
The key factor was keeping Cothren’s name hush-hush after he resigned from his post in 2019 during a racist and sexist texting scandal that engulfed Casada, who also left the speaker’s office after a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
In fact, during a four-week trial that nearly left attendees in traction from sitting on federal courtroom pews, attorneys for Casada and Cothren didn’t try to deny the details, claiming mainly that the two were operating a legitimate business and did the work lawmakers wanted.
The jury convicted them on multiple counts of fraud, bribery and money laundering, only to see the pardon waste a month of their lives.
Santa, we’re coming for you
Less than a week after U.S. forces invaded Venezuela and captured its president and first lady, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles started parroting President Trump’s desire to take over mineral-rich Greenland too.
Ogles, who remains under federal investigation for campaign finance violations according to a WTVF report, called America the “dominant predator force” in the Western Hemisphere and said Greenland needs to break its relationship with Denmark and do more to protect America. 
Denmark is a member of NATO and already allows the United States to use Greenland for defense purposes.
Ninety-nine percent of Americans have never been to Greenland or know little about it other than it’s cold as crap there. It’s a self-governed territory of Denmark.
A takeover, though, puts us a little closer to the North Pole and the ultimate goal.
While experts debate the Monroe Doctrine and whether it was legal to extract Nicolas Maduro on cocaine trafficking charges (that’s so 1980s), we’ve decided it’s high time to take back Christmas. Festivus for the rest of us just won’t do. We’re not stopping with Greenland, either. We’re heading straight for Santa’s hometown, the reindeer and the toy shop. 
The charge: failure to deliver the goods. We got nothing but a tinhorn dictator. Oops, nearly forgot to mention Venezuela’s oil supplies.
“I can’t drive 55”
House Speaker Cameron Sexton declined to say Thursday where he was heading the October day a Metro Nashville Police officer stopped his security detail on Briley Parkway for speeding.

“We were just going to another event, like it is, like we do,” Sexton said after a State Building Commission meeting.
Asked why the vehicle driven by a state trooper was doing 85 in a 55, Sexton referred to a statement from his office. That statement, though, only accuses the MNPD officer of being “overzealous” and jeopardizing the safety of Sexton and THP officers and claims there was no violation of traffic laws based on state law. The THP officer flashed his lights at the Metro officer after being flashed to pull over.
In other words, it was business as usual.

But, who will respond? In Idaho, first-responder units are struggling.
Your safety net is “EMS” (Emergency Medical Services). You know the sirens, flashing lights, ambulances, helicopters, firetrucks, and dedicated emergency-care responders. Local first responders serve everyone in crisis, not just their local community. Wherever you’re traveling in Idaho, a network of first responders helps protect you.
In this rural Idaho county, paramedics are being trained to help with mental health crises

Idaho faces daunting challenges providing rural health care, including EMS. Stanley, Idaho, is gateway to some of America’s spectacular wildlands and rivers. How can a town of 60-some people be responsible for providing health care for over a million visitors? Stanley made medical history by helping create the nurse practitioner profession and rural EMS.
In Stanley in 1971, we offered one of the first EMT trainings and established Idaho’s first 9-1-1 system. U.S. Forest Service and Idaho Fish and Game staff joined local townspeople to volunteer as EMTs to help staff the Stanley Ambulance — some have volunteered to take emergency call for decades.
One reason rural EMS units are in trouble is because ambulances cost $120,000-$300,000. Our first Stanley ambulance, costing $300 in 1972, was military surplus with holes in the floorboards, fumes, and an unreliable electrical system. One night, we lost our lights in subzero temperatures transporting a heart-attack patient over 8,900-foot Galena Summit. U.S. Sen. Frank Church highlighted the Stanley Ambulance and nurse practitioner when asking Senate colleagues to support rural health care. Today, elected officials accept they have responsibilities in supporting EMS.
Rural communities don’t have the tax base and depend on volunteers. Yet, fewer younger people are stepping up to volunteer. This isn’t a uniquely Idaho problem: For years, he has saved lives in Rural America. Who will take his place? (New York Times).
Idahoans should be proud of its leadership in creating solutions for rural health care. Legislators, notably physician/legislator Dr. John Edwards of Council, led efforts to bring health care to rural communities: licensing nurse practitioners and training rural doctors through WWAMI and the University of Utah.
Rep. Terry Crapo, the older brother of U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, was Idaho’s House Majority Leader from 1968-1972, and led bipartisan efforts to support EMS. His work was foundational to establishing the Idaho Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (Idaho EMS) in 1973.
Today, Idaho EMS is a statewide system responsible for providing immediate pre-hospital medical care and transporting the sick and injured. Wherever you are in Idaho, your emergency care is coordinated through “StateComm,” Idaho EMS State Communications Center, located in Meridian.
In 2025 in the Idaho Capitol Rotunda, while we released our new book, “Moving Mountains: creating the Nurse Practitioner and Rural EMS,” elsewhere in the building legislators were discussing making EMS an “essential service.” This would be a critical step to committing state resources to supporting struggling first-responder units. Instead, the Legislature voted to move Idaho EMS from the Department of Health and Welfare to the Idaho Military Division (IMD).
We lived through the health care revolution creating EMS and were part of that revolution. Today, a half-century later, we see our state’s emergency safety nets unravelling.
The key point is that Idahoans’ health care depends on our elected leaders. Idahoans need enduring solutions to our health care crisis hitting first and worst in our rural communities.
We don’t expect legislators to read our book and learn from the Stanley Ambulance’s volunteer EMTs. But we do ask that our elected leaders take action to protect their voting constituents who, someday, will call 9-1-1 and need to know that someone, somewhere, will respond to their pleas and screams for help.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Democratic National Committee on Friday sent a letter to Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office warning that the state is on the verge of violating federal voter-protection laws over a potential agreement to share Mississippi voter files with the Department of Justice. 
The state agency, according to the DNC, is about to send the federal government Mississippi’s full voter file, something President Donald Trump’s administration has pressured states to hand over, so the Justice Department can crack down on alleged ineligible voters. 
Ken Martin, the chairman of the DNC, said in a statement that the Trump administration wants to force states such as Mississippi to hand over voter files so it can create a national database with sensitive personal information such as driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, and party affiliation. 
“The DNC won’t stand idly by as the Trump DOJ tries to get access to Mississippi voters’ sensitive information and put eligible voters at risk of being wrongfully purged from Mississippi’s voter rolls, which is why we are calling on the Mississippi Secretary of State to stand up for Mississippians and reject the Trump administration’s illegal agreement,” Martin said.
Watson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The DNC fears that this agreement could result in eligible voters being removed from registration lists, particularly near elections, and put their personal information at risk. 
To address these concerns, the DNC has requested records from Watson’s office about the proposed agreement and any communications with the Justice Department about voter-list maintenance. 
Trump officials, in 2017, made a similar request for voter records from Mississippi. Then-Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican who is currently lieutenant governor, responded to the request by telling them they can “go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Virginia’s employers say the lack of affordable, high-quality child care is hurting businesses, with 88% of survey respondents reporting employee lateness or absences, and 65% reporting reduced work hours, according to results published last month by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, the Richmond Fed and the Virginia Chamber Foundation. 
The findings come as state lawmakers prepare to address child care and other issues facing the commonwealth during the 2026 General Assembly Session. VPM reported in October that nearly 14,000 children were on a wait list for the Child Care Subsidy Program alone.
Kathy Glazer, president of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, said the survey’s findings are a clear indicator of risks to Virginia’s economy and workforce. Results indicate that the highest disruption is to hospitality, food service, retail, trade and transportation and health care industries.
“When child care is unaffordable or unavailable, it constrains our workforce, weakens productivity, and slows economic growth,” Glazer said in a statement. “Addressing child care access and affordability must remain a top priority if Virginia wants to stay competitive and continue attracting working families and top-tier businesses to our state.”
The survey gathered responses from 308 Virginia employers. More than eight in ten say that child care challenges hinder hiring and retention. Additionally, 41% report that employees turn down job offers or promotions because of child care concerns.
Other findings include families facing a severe shortage of available, affordable child care options, with 65% of employers saying their workers struggle to find open slots and more than 85% citing cost as a major burden.
Employers said they want to help, but cost is a barrier, with fewer than 20% of businesses currently offering support. 
Results indicated that many employers are open to offering solutions like child care referral services, cost-sharing models, employer-sponsored care and child care vouchers or subsidies.
“The lack of cost-effective childcare options in Virginia is a barrier to workforce participation, and employers want to be part of the solution,” said Keith Martin, interim president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber Foundation. “This was a consistent theme we heard from employers statewide while developing Blueprint Virginia 2035, which makes clear that strengthening our workforce requires solutions which include prioritizing state funding for quality, affordable childcare through efforts like the proposed Employee Child Care Assistance Pilot Program.”
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, is carrying the Employee Child Care Assistance Program proposal, otherwise known as Senate Bill 3. The program would allow employers to receive state matching funds to help pay for an employee’s child care. 
Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, filed the companion measure, House Bill 18.
Also in the Senate, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton,  filed Senate Bill 20, expanding Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program so more families can qualify based on income. Under the proposal, the Virginia Department of Education would be directed to develop and implement a phased reduction model for the Child Care Subsidy Program that gradually reduces the amount of help a family receives as they start to earn more. 
The bills closely align with Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s plan to strengthen child care in the commonwealth. Her plan also seeks to help more Virginians enter the early child care sector and improve worker retention.
Lawmakers are likely to file additional bills and budget proposals to address child care this month.
The General Assembly Session begins on Wednesday in Richmond and will run until at least mid-March.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
Reducing SNAP error rates
New requirements in the latest federal funding package mandate that states have to significantly reduce the error rate of calculating and distributing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in order to still be able to receive the funding. The Virginia Mercury filed FOIA requests with the Department of Social Services and the Department of Health to glean information on how the state is working to prevent under or over paying recipients as gubernatorial administrations prepare to pass the torch.
Public records revealed the state is considering a $1.7 million contract with a company called KPMG that offers tax, audit, and advisory services. The company would help local social services offices improve payment accuracy.
Records also showed a group called the Virginia League for Social Service Executives expressed concerns about whether smaller offices would be able to handle the additional administrative burden. Out-going Gov. Glenn Youngkin earmarked $2.4 million in his budget that would go towards hiring 14 people to assist in those endeavors. It is not certain that Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will keep that money in the final budget.
Lack of state funding could raise Richmond water bills following 2025 water crisis
One year after the city of Richmond and surrounding counties went days without water following a winter storm that knocked out power and triggered a series of failures at the water treatment plant, the possibility of residents’ water bills rising looms on the horizon.
Following the crisis, the city made a number of changes, including creating a 10-year plan for water system upgrades. That plan cost totals $1.4 billion over a decade to improve the treatment plant, pumps, pipes and other projects across the city.
Mayor Danny Avula sent a request to Gov. Glenn Youngkin for $80 million in the state budget to help offset some of the cost that will ultimately be placed on water customers to cover the price of those projects. But Youngkin did not include the request in his final budget proposal. 
The Richmonder requested documents that show just how much bills will be impacted if the state funds remain out of the budget. The mayor’s office rejected the request, citing them as mayoral working papers. Avula said in a press conference that conversations with the incoming administration are still occurring in hopes of the funding making it into the final version of the budget.



				The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.			


Potential racism and retaliation at Red Onion State Prison
Allegations of racism and abuse were raised by inmates at Red Onion State Prison in 2024 which launched an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General into claims of physical and sexual abuse, inhumane treament, and poor living conditions.
In records obtained by the Virginia Mercury this week, most of the claims have been found “unsubstantiated” by the Correction’s Ombudsman. However, the allegations of racism and retaliation were deemed “inconclusive” which neither proves or disproves their occurrence at the facility.
Office of the State Inspector General representatives visited the prison to conduct interviews about the claims made by inmates who had reportedly burned themselves in protest of the living conditions. Some of the correctional officers interviewed suggested they believed the inmates who burned themselves were attempting to get transferred to facilities closer to family, OSIG’s investigation relayed.
Inmates, their families, and activists have previously accused the prison of over-using solitary confinement. A legislative report in 2024 found that at least one facility in the state was not allowing inmates time out of their cells for the mandated amount of time when in solitary confinement, which in Virginia is referred to as restorative housing.
The new report by OSIG found that Red Onion was not in violation of the rules around the confinement and some inmates had refused the out of cell time. Investigators recommended that the prison make complaints forms more accessible to prisoners and offer additional education and health resources. 
Efforts to reduce FOIA costs makes return to General Assembly
For years, Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, has filed legislation that looks to limit what public agencies can charge for public records and clarifies how agencies can seek court relief when faced with large or complicated requests.
The Virginia Mercury reported earlier this week that Senate Bill 56 would limit agencies to charging the median hourly rate of pay of their employees — or the actual hourly rate of the employee performing the work, whichever is lower — when calculating labor costs for producing public records.
Those in support of the bill believe it will prevent agencies from assigning high-wage workers from processing the requests, which would curb production costs. The bill does carve out some exceptions to the rule.
Roem, a former journalist, has made public records reform a key priority for her term. She said the goal of her latest bill is to make  records more accessible to the public so they may be used as a tool to gain critical information about government agencies.

And I’m absolutely giggly about it.
This was the expected culmination, after all, of a work history that began when I logged shifts at fast-food joints in Washington as a teenager – dodging both grease and occasionally rude customers.  
I know, intellectually, that I derive all sorts of benefits from my federal tax dollars: Military protection. Interstate highways. Health care, which I gained directly after starting Medicare at age 65. (I still fork over monthly premiums, but thank goodness it’s available for senior citizens. Attacks on Obamacare for younger Americans are petty and threaten lives.)
Now, though, the money set aside for Social Security was finally coming back to me. I’ve wagered that I should start collecting those benefits now.
Happy birthday, Social Security. Unless Congress acts, full benefits end in 7 years.

The pending insolvency of the system is a looming threat. By 2032, Social Security won’t be able to pay out full retirement benefits without significant changes. Among the proposals is ending the cap on earnings subject to the Social Security tax, which currently is $184,500.
Of course, the program is popular among seniors, who are a reliable voting bloc. Do-nothing lawmakers won’t stay in Congress much longer if they don’t act.
This Baby Boomer could’ve waited until turning almost 67 to gain full retirement, and thus more cash monthly. But I was chastened by the fact the Black men in my immediate family didn’t make it past 70, and that life expectancy among African-American men is lower than other subgroups.
So today, I’m relishing the GIF a friend sent me after I told him the news about starting my benefits now. The fictional character Carlton Banks breaks out in his eponymous dance.
I don’t care how corny it is. I love getting paid, for the taxes I’ve already contributed over decades.

A 2022 report by the Greater Ohio Policy Center said that the state labor force declined by 91,000 between 2000 and 2020 — a pretty good indicator that a weak job market has been to blame for the Buckeye State’s slowing population growth.
In a survey conducted by Scioto Analysis in late December, economists agreed jobs and growth are linked. Asked whether they agreed that “Employment opportunities are a major contributor to Ohio’s current population-growth trend,” 20 agreed, one disagreed and two were uncertain.
In the comment section of the survey, Kathryn Wilson of Kent State University said the places in Ohio where population is growing confirm the relationship between economic opportunity and population trends. Unlike most other counties, Franklin and five others in Central Ohio are expected to grow in population, some robustly.
“Employment opportunities are a contributor on both sides of the ledger,” Wilson wrote. “Areas around Columbus that are seeing growth in population are also seeing job growth. Other areas of the state with less job growth are seeing a net migration out of people.”
Andy Welki of John Carroll University put it more succinctly.

“Self interest drives individual choices,” he wrote. “People follow economic opportunities.”
The sour news about Ohio’s growth comes after the state’s Republican leadership has spent billions on promises that those expenditures would create jobs. 
In 2011, then-Gov. John Kasich led the effort to create JobsOhio, which now has a large, highly paid staff. The organization claims it is a private company, but it was created by the legislature.
Without competitive bidding, it was allowed to lease the state liquor franchise for less than it was worth. And a year ago, a board under now-Gov. Mike DeWine extended the lease to 2053 — without requiring JobsOhio to pay taxpayers any additional money.
Taxpayers have now foregone well over $1 billion that they would have received from the liquor franchise. JobsOhio has awarded that money in business incentives, but it has struggled to show that it’s created any jobs.
DeWine also has provided billions to a Central Ohio chipmaker for a project that may never become reality. In addition, his administration has provided incentives to low-employment data centers that one analysis said cost taxpayers $1 million for each job created.
In addition to all that, Kasich in 2013 signed into law a tax break for limited liability companies that is heavily tilted in favor of wealthy Ohioans. Again, the promise was that it would create jobs.
That tax break costs Ohioans about $1 billion a year. But Ohio now has the nation’s sixth-highest unemployment. So that, too, appears to not be working.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220909__R611245-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 05:11:45.557728

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)With food insecurity on the rise, Maine lawmakers are scrambling to ensure they have a sense of how many people are going hungry after the federal government’s recent cancellation of a key food insecurity survey.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Household Food Security Report, started under former President Bill Clinton, measured rates of food insecurity across the country every year for three decades. Food banks, state departments and nonprofits used the results of that survey to inform their efforts to address hunger. 
Last September, the department announced it was ending the survey, which experts said at the time would mean that when it comes to hunger, they would be flying blind.
On the first day of the legislative session, Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren) introduced LD 2040, which would institute a statewide survey to collect information from households to help guide food assistance programs. Maine has not collected this kind of state-level data before, and this survey would be an opportunity to gain detailed data about what communities and demographics are most acutely impacted by food insecurity, Pluecker said.
“The result would be to understand our state’s food insecurity more accurately so that we can make better decisions,” he said at a public hearing before the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee on Wednesday. 
“It’s about accountability to Maine people who go to bed hungry, and responsibility to taxpayers funding anti-hunger programs,” Pluecker said. “We owe both groups clear answers about whether our efforts at ending hunger are working.”
The proposal is for a limited pilot study ending in 2028, unless reauthorized. The study will mostly rely on private philanthropy, except for a $500 state contribution.
The bill was backed by the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future as well as several anti-hunger organizations, including Good Shepherd Food Bank, Full Plates Full Potential, and Maine Children’s Alliance. No one during the hearing spoke against it.
Maine experts say feds ‘hiding the evidence’ by eliminating key food security survey

Over the last decade, federal data has helped guide the state’s planning in its roadmap to end hunger by 2030, said Anna Korsen, deputy director of Full Plates Full Potential and co-chair of the advisory committee charged with implementing the roadmap.  
In her testimony before the committee, Korsen said that access to reliable data allowed advocates to make major strides in reducing hunger in Maine. COVID-era programs to address hunger, including expanded nutrition benefits, free school meals for all, and the Child Tax Credit expansion resulted in “rapid and dramatic declines” in food insecurity for families and children, she said. 
But Maine still has the highest rate of childhood food insecurity in New England, with one in five kids unsure of where their next meal will come from. In rural areas like Aroostook County, that number jumps to one in four children.
Based on the latest USDA survey data released a week ago — the last release due to the program’s cancellation — overall hunger is increasing across the country and in Maine. Nationally, 13.7% of households were food insecure in 2024. While the report did not break down state-level data, between 2022 and 2024, an average of 12.9% of Maine households lacked adequate access to food, increasing from 9.5% between 2019 and 2021.
Alex Carter, senior policy advocate at Maine Equal Justice, said with the survey cancelled, it will be harder to track trends and evaluate the impacts of policy, including the “likely increases in food insecurity that will result from the expected loss and changes to SNAP benefits.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThere will be some fresh faces under the Gold Dome when lawmakers reconvene next week for the 2026 legislative session. 
That’s thanks to a series of off-year special elections held to replace state lawmakers who have died, resigned or been appointed to other political offices. At least three representatives will make their House debut, and another three legislators will join the Senate to finish out the remainder of their predecessor’s two-year legislative term.
There are also more special elections to come in the new year, after two lawmakers recently announced they were leaving the state Legislature. Former Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, resigned her seat days before she was charged with fraudulently receiving nearly $14,000 in unemployment benefits. Former Rep. Lynn Heffner, an Augusta Democrat, also resigned Monday citing damage to her home from Hurricane Helene and the state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent. Details about the elections to replace the two representatives have not yet been announced.
Here’s a look at the newcomers.
House District 23
The newest lawmaker in a Cherokee County-based district will be Republican Bill Fincher, who defeated Democrat Scott Sanders during a runoff election Tuesday, maintaining the GOP’s hold over the district.
Fincher, a former district attorney who now owns an RV park, received over 70% of the vote according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office. He will replace Republican state Rep. Mandi Ballinger of Canton, who died in October after a long battle with cancer.
In an interview, Fincher told the Georgia Recorder that he was “absolutely humbled” by the support of the voters in his district. His top priorities will be capping property taxes, reducing traffic around metro Atlanta and lowering the cost of insurance premiums.
The district, which includes Canton, part of northern Holly Springs and the surrounding unincorporated areas, heavily favors a Republican. 
House District 106

Democrat Muhammad Akbar Ali, a graphic designer and former first vice chair of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, is headed to the Gold Dome after defeating fellow Democrat Marqus Cole during a runoff election for a southwest Gwinnett County state House seat.
Ali focused his campaign on issues like lowering the cost of living, supporting public schools and protecting the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ Georgians. He received a slew of endorsements from key figures in Georgia’s Democratic establishment, including House Minority Caucus Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, and former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes.
The district’s previous representative, Snellville Democrat Shelly Hutchinson, stepped down from the state Legislature earlier to care for a family member. She later endorsed Ali.
At 21, Ali is set to become the youngest state legislator currently serving in Georgia, stealing the title of youngest lawmaker from Democratic Rep. Bryce Berry of Atlanta.

In a stunning upset, Democrats flipped a northeast Georgia House seat, gaining control of an Athens-area district for the first time since 2019.
Eric Gisler, a tech executive and small business owner, will replace former state Rep. Marcus Wiedower, a Watkinsville Republican who abruptly resigned from his seat to focus on his work as vice president of external affairs at the real estate firm Hillpointe. 
The district, which covers parts of Clarke and Oconee counties, has historically leaned conservative. Wiedower won his last election with 61% of the vote.
In an interview, Gisler credited his campaign’s success to a strong ground game, as well as his focus on issues like health care access and the rising cost of living, which he said likely appealed to some Republican voters.
Senate District 18
Voters have yet to select a replacement for state Sen. John F. Kennedy, a Macon Republican who resigned in December to focus on his campaign for lieutenant governor.
The district encompasses Crawford, Monroe, Peach and Upson counties, as well as part of Bibb and Houston counties. Six candidates — five Republicans and one Democrat — have qualified for the seat. They include former state Rep. Lauren Daniel, former Forsyth Mayor Eric Wilson and former Fort Valley Mayor Pro Tem LeMario Brown.
The election will be held on Jan. 20, roughly a week after the start of the 2026 legislative session, and early voting for the race will begin on Dec. 29. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be held on Feb. 17.
Senate District 21

Republican state Sen. Jason Dickerson, the president of a private investment firm, will replace former Alpharetta Republican state Sen. Brandon Beach after securing a victory in what was perhaps the most contentious legislative special election of 2025.
Beach, who had represented the district since 2013, resigned from the Senate after President Donald Trump appointed him to serve as the 46th U.S. Treasurer. The district, which includes parts of Fulton and Cherokee counties, is predominantly Republican, with Beach receiving upwards of 70% of the vote against a Democratic challenger in 2024.
But Democrats rejoiced after Debra Shigley, an Alpharetta mom, attorney and small business owner, racked up nearly 40% of the vote in a seven-way special election. Her campaign also received door-knocking help from high-profile Democrats like Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin and U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff.
The district’s Republican base quickly coalesced around Dickerson in the runoff, and he ultimately won the seat with over 60% of the vote, though Democrats cheered the gains made in the conservative district. 
Senate District 35
Democrat Jaha Howard, a dentist and former Cobb County School Board member, is headed to the state Capitol, representing a metro Atlanta district that includes portions of Cobb and Fulton counties.
Howard narrowly defeated former Democratic state Rep. Roger Bruce, who retired from the state Legislature in 2024, during a special election runoff on Dec. 16. He will replace former state Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat who resigned from the state Senate in September to focus on his campaign for governor.
According to his campaign website, Howard plans to prioritize supporting small businesses, reducing barriers to health care access and increasing literacy rates.
This is not Howard’s first foray into politics; he has also been a candidate for state school superintendent and ran for a seat on the Cobb County commission last year. During a previous bid for state Senate in 2017, however, he came under fire for sexist and homophobic comments he posted on social media between 2011 and 2014. Last year, he told the Georgia Recorder he has worked to gain voters’ trust in his commitment to LGBTQ and women’s rights.
He also received an endorsement from state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, one of the two openly gay lawmakers in the chamber.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0221.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 05:11:45.557728

(Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)VANDALIA, Mo. — Kathy Briggs slipped her arms through the thick straps of a brand-new baby carrier, tugging it over her beige shirt as two other women stood beside her, tightening buckles and adjusting the padded waistband.
The carrier was still stiff from its packaging, and Briggs shifted her feet as one of the women gently lifted then-6-month-old Melody into the front pouch.
Melody’s gray-blue eyes tracked the women’s hands, and her wispy blond hair — gathered into a tiny pink bow — bobbed slightly with the movement. She blinked up at the adults.
“Put your foot in there,” one of the women said, guiding Melody’s leg through the opening.
“She’s just a little chunk,” the other woman said.
Briggs’ eyes widened, and she squealed, half laughing, as Melody settled against her chest. Across the room, a few women looked up from boxes of newly arrived donations — tiny onesies and hip carriers still wrapped in plastic.
Someone let out a soft “aww.” Briggs, 29, bounced on her heels, testing the weight, her palms hovering protectively near Melody’s back.
For a moment, the room felt like any early childhood nursery: adult chatter and baby babbles, women comparing baby gear and swapping soothing techniques.
Yet the jangling of keys and the watchful eyes of uniformed officers were a reminder that this colorful corner of the world existed not in a day care, but inside a women’s prison in rural Missouri.
Programs like this one allow babies inside prisons — a rare and controversial approach that forces states to confront how punishment, public safety and early childhood development collide. As more women enter state prisons while pregnant, lawmakers and corrections officials are expanding prison nursery programs, betting that keeping mothers and infants together can reduce trauma and recidivism — even as critics question whether any prison can ever be an appropriate place for a child.

Missouri’s program, which opened last February at the Women’s Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center, is the ninth nursery program currently operating inside of a prison in the country. The program was adopted into state law in 2022.
Each year, thousands of pregnant offenders are admitted to local jails and state prisons — most for nonviolent crimes. In 2023, the latest year with data available, about 2% of women who were admitted to state prisons were pregnant, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The number of incarcerated women has climbed sharply over the past several decades, making them one of the fastest-growing segments of the prison population. Some experts say the trend has forced states to confront a basic reality: Most correctional facilities were never designed to accommodate new mothers.


“Routine aspects of prison operations just really don’t consider the distinct needs of women, and particularly not of pregnant women,” said Alycia Welch, the associate director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. Welch researches carceral conditions and oversight with a focus on women’s experiences.
Federal reports and research have found that pregnant inmates face systemic barriers to timely care — from guards controlling access to medical treatment to logistical delays and medical fees. Shackling during pregnancy and childbirth persists despite restrictions in at least 42 states.
The programs benefit relatively few women, and some criminal justice advocates say they reinforce the notion that incarceration — rather than community-based drug treatment or diversion — should remain the default response for pregnant women in the criminal legal system.
Some research suggests the nurseries can strengthen early bonding, improve maternal mental health and support the transition from incarceration back into the community after new mothers have time to parent their infants in a structured, supportive environment.
“This community just lifts us up,” Briggs said.
Inside Missouri’s nursery program
The room Kaley McDowell shares with her infant daughter, Kimber, is arranged for two mothers and two babies — twin beds on each wall, a pair of cribs nearby and space left open for feeding, rocking and play.
McDowell’s rocking chair sits in the corner, draped with a warm, butter yellow blanket. She settled into the rocker with Kimber in her arms just as a soft, classical melody drifted from one of the crib-soother toys. Kimber curled tightly against her chest; her cheek pressed into her mother’s shirt.
“She thinks she’s gonna eat now,” McDowell joked, shifting her baby upright on her thighs as the two rocked slowly back and forth. She then set Kimber down so the child could try standing.
Kimber steadied herself, then reached down toward her tiny toes as if surprised to find them there.
Kaley McDowell helps her daughter Kimber stand while sitting in a rocking chair in their room — their favorite spot in the nursery unit. Each mom-and-baby room can accommodate up to two mothers, with a total capacity of 14 mom and baby pairs. (Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)
McDowell, 34, is a girl mom through and through. All four of her daughters — ages 13, 9, 2 and now-7-month-old Kimber — have “K” names, a small bit of continuity she’s proud of.
Inside the nursery unit, she’s the experienced mom, the one other women seek out for advice.
McDowell isn’t set for release until August, which means Kimber will leave the nursery around 15 months old. In the meantime, McDowell is taking classes to get her GED diploma and hopes to earn her license as a certified nurse assistant.
Missouri’s prison nursery program allows eligible women to live with their newborns for up to 18 months. Women must have no more than 18 months remaining on their sentence at the time of delivery, and those who have committed violent sexual offenses or crimes against children cannot participate.
Prison officials also review disciplinary history, physical and mental health, and engagement in programming before approving someone for one of the unit’s seven bedrooms, which collectively can house up to 14 babies at a time.

About two dozen infants are expected to cycle through the nursery each year, and staff anticipate that number will climb — a sign of growing demand for the program.
“I have watched moms transform their lives,” said Kim Perkins, the nursery’s program manager.
Across the day, the nursery fills with the kinds of small, steady interactions that shape early childhood: Mothers reading baby books, caregivers rocking fussy infants, babies sprawled across play mats surrounded by stuffed animals. Correctional officers and nursery staff also often help, whether by holding a wiggly baby or fetching supplies.
“They like to come and steal the babies when they can,” McDowell said. “They’re like our in-house grandmas.”
The unit’s officers also are trained to expect round-the-clock movement, and the team includes male officers, so infants grow accustomed to hearing different voices.

“It’s going to be a good thing for these women,” said Lisa Unger, one of the unit’s correctional officers. While she was initially apprehensive about the program, she said she has watched women genuinely change over time with the support they receive.
When mothers cook group meals — something that happens at least once a week — the unit feels briefly like a crowded family kitchen, with women passing plates, joking and handing off infants so someone else can finish stirring a pot.
Movement across the unit is tightly restricted, though. Babies are not allowed upstairs to the sleeping and living quarters of caregivers — incarcerated women trained for the role — and mothers go there only to “shop” in the storage room stocked with donated clothing. When the weather is nice and staffing allows, the mothers can take their babies outside to the play area. The babies do not enter other parts of the prison.
Turning point
For much of her life, Kathy Briggs did not imagine a future that included her. She was first incarcerated at 15, and has now been in and out of incarceration three times.
Addiction shaped nearly every corner of her adulthood — where she slept and whom she trusted. Some nights were spent in drug houses, others on the street. She lost two pregnancies.
New report urges more individualized justice system responses for women

At her lowest point, Briggs tattooed “DNR” — which stands for “do not resuscitate” — above her left eye.
When Briggs learned she was expecting again — this time while in county jail awaiting adjudication — she doubted her ability to stay sober, to find housing, to understand motherhood at all. When she learned she was carrying twins, her panic deepened.
Who would take them? Who would trust her with them?
The turning point came with a sentence delivered calmly from the bench. Facing drug possession and firearm-related charges, Briggs expected another familiar outcome and that she’d be released shortly. Instead, the judge told her she would go to prison — and have her babies there.
Briggs protested — babies did not belong in prison. But the judge insisted. More importantly, he told her he believed in her. It was the first time, she said, anyone in a position of authority had made her feel like she could overcome her past.
She arrived at prison seven months pregnant.
At first, she had considered adoption, but then she learned she was carrying two babies — whom she has nicknamed “Little Lyric” and “Mighty Melody,” inspired by the music that always made her feel free.

The infants’ play space is awash in color: Rugs patterned with swirling motifs and florals; shelves crammed with books, dolls and stacking toys; rocking chairs with tufted pillows. A baby swing clicks rhythmically in one corner. Near a window overlooking an outdoor play area, a potted plant soaks up the morning sun.
Inside the nursery, Briggs’ daughters, whom she calls her “best friends,” thrive. Their father also is incarcerated, and the nursery staff are working to make sure he can receive regular updates and photos of the girls.
“Some of us didn’t grow up with good families or a lot of love,” Briggs said. “Here, they’re teaching us how to grow with our babies, and that is such a beautiful thing.”
Some of the program’s caregivers say the strength of the unit comes from the fact that no one is raising a baby in isolation — and that some caregivers bring their own lived experience as mothers to guide the others.
One morning, caregiver Tara Carroll sat on the floor, sorting a pile of donated baby clothes while several women gathered around her — some seated at a nearby table, others standing and talking among themselves.

She organized the outfits by size, slipping the clothes onto tiny colorful hangers. As she logged each item, a few of the women began matching tops and bottoms, holding them up for one another to weigh in.
“This one will fit her, and it’s got cute little pants and a snowflake,” Carroll told one mother.
“That’s cuuuuuute,” another mom chimed in.
Carroll, 34, has been incarcerated for several years on property-related charges, and she remembers what it was like before the nursery existed.
In 2022, she delivered her now-3-year-old daughter, Dillon Rayee, at a nearby hospital and spent 48 hours with her before her husband took their newborn home.
“It was heart-wrenching, and I promised my daughter that I would do everything that I could to come home to her,” Carroll said. She hopes to use her experience in the prison to become a doula.
Until the nursery opened, her birth experience was the norm: a day or two with a newborn, then the baby went into foster care or with family and the mother returned to her cell. For Carroll, helping the women in the unit now — guiding them through feedings, showing them how to swaddle, offering advice during long nights — feels like a way of honoring her promise to her daughter.
Policies across the states
Across the country, fewer than a dozen states operate nursery programs that allow incarcerated mothers to live with their newborns.
New York operates the nation’s oldest prison nursery, which opened in the early 1900s at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility. The program allows up to 25 incarcerated mothers to live with their infants — typically until age 1 — under a system governed by state law and administered by a nonprofit provider, Hour Children.
Newer programs — in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Ohio, Washington state and West Virginia — vary widely in size, eligibility and funding. Many rely heavily on nonprofit partners or donations to cover essentials such as diapers, cribs and parenting classes.
Incarcerated women often don’t have enough period products

Nebraska’s program, which launched in 1994, allows mothers to participate if their parole eligibility date or release date falls within 18 months of their child’s birth.
Rosita Vizcarra, 29, said the program has been a “blessing,” giving her the chance to bond with her now-9-month-old son, Liam, while also learning how to be a better parent to her two older daughters.
“He’s crawling and starting to stand,” Vizcarra wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform. “He’s such a happy baby.”
Miranda Messenger, 37, told Stateline in a message that the program has given her what she and her now 4-month-old son, Kyle, need to succeed and stay connected to her support system while separated from her three older children.
“It’s gonna help Miranda tenfold,” said Shannon Fune, Kyle’s father, who has been able to visit the pair a few times. “I was a little bit jealous or disappointed that I wasn’t gonna be there.”
A 2018 study of Nebraska’s program found participation was associated with a 28% reduction in recidivism within three years of the initial offense and a 39% reduction in returns to prison custody within 20 years over the 20-year period of the study. The author, Joseph R. Carlson, a former professor at the University of Nebraska, also estimated that the program saved the state more than $6 million between 1994 and 2012.
A handful of states — Kansas, North Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin — are considering or expanding nursery programs. Idaho and Wyoming explored nursery plans in recent years, but abandoned them due to space, budget and staffing issues, according to state corrections officials.
Many other states offer other programs they say benefit incarcerated mothers, such as doula programs during pregnancy or during labor and delivery, extended visitation for young children or mother-child facilities based in communities rather than a prison.
Although interest in programs for pregnant and postpartum women in the criminal legal system has grown, experts across the country say there is still not enough research to know how well these programs work — and even basic data on the number and experiences or outcomes of incarcerated pregnant people remains limited.
“It’s, for me, really unfortunate that we are doing this without evidence to inform the policies we’re putting in place,” said Rebecca Shlafer, a child psychologist and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. Shlafer also evaluated the implementation of Minnesota’s 2021 Healthy Start Act, which allows pregnant and postpartum women to participate in community-based alternatives.
‘A real patchwork’
It’s hard to know exactly how many pregnant people enter jails and prisons each year. The federal government does not require correctional systems to track pregnancy data, and reporting varies widely by state.
By the end of 2023, 305 pregnant women were housed in state prisons, according to the latest federal data, which was released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in April. At least 75 women lived in prison nurseries or residential programs with their infants in 2023.










Some of us didn't grow up with good families or a lot of love.


– Kathy Briggs, an incarcerated mother in Missouri


A 2019 study of incarcerated pregnant women — drawing from both state and federal facilities — estimated roughly 58,000 admissions to prisons and jails between 2016 and 2017. The study, conducted by the Advocacy and Research on Reproductive Wellness of Incarcerated People group and published in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Public Health, is considered the first national investigation into pregnancy frequency and outcomes in prisons.
There are no federal standards for prison nursery programs, and each state sets its own rules — who qualifies, how long mothers can stay, what staffing and safety protocols look like and what reentry support is offered.
US families shoulder nearly $350B in annual costs tied to incarceration, report finds

Studies of long-running programs in Nebraska and New York found that mothers who participated were less likely to return to prison than similar women who weren’t admitted. But those results, some experts say, may be shaped by the programs’ strict eligibility rules: Nurseries typically accept people with lower-level offenses and short sentences.
A study published in April in the peer-reviewed Women & Criminal Justice journal found that the existence of prison nursery programs caused stress and anxiety for those who weren’t eligible after giving birth, leaving them feeling like unfit mothers, and diverted resources from other ways to help incarcerated moms maintain bonds with their babies.
“We can think outside the prison walls for how to keep moms and babies together in ways that still maintain safety and accountability,” said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, a medical anthropologist and an obstetrician-gynecologist at Johns Hopkins University. Sufrin also leads the Advocacy and Research on Reproductive Wellness of Incarcerated People group.
Critics of prison nurseries argue that the correctional environment is fundamentally ill-suited to meet the health, developmental and emotional needs of pregnant or postpartum women and their infants.
Prisons are usually not staffed with maternal health experts or pediatricians, and medical care is often inconsistent. The environment itself limits babies’ movement and ability to form relationships with other family members. The children can’t go outdoors every day.
Financial stability also is a major concern. Some of the existing prison nursery programs nationwide primarily depend on donations or nonprofit support instead of consistent state funding. Critics argue that this makes nurseries a fragile, resource-heavy solution that helps only a small number of women while reinforcing the broader system of incarceration rather than providing a reliable, scalable alternative.
“It’s a real patchwork out there, and every state is different, but again, just not ideal tohave women and babies in these settings,” said Erin McClain, a research associate and the assistant director of the University of North Carolina Collaborative for Maternal and Infant Health, a research center focusing on high-risk pregnancies and infants.

A path forward
Briggs is set to leave Missouri’s Women’s Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center for a halfway house, again with her babies, later this month. She has thought extensively about what she’ll one day tell her daughters about their first few months of life — and about how far she has come from the days when her “DNR” tattoo reflected a very different outlook.
“I want to live life, and I want to show them that they can live a good life,” Briggs said. “I want to be the light that makes them feel warm.”
Inside the program, she learned how to care for her daughters and, just as critically, how to care for herself, she said. For someone who had grown up without much love or guidance, the nursery became a place where both were taught, deliberately and daily.
She hopes to return someday to help others navigate the early months of parenthood behind bars.
“More mothers in this situation deserve an opportunity to learn to be a better mother.”

Pepper spoke highly of Acton, referring to her time helping lead the state during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I’ve greatly admired her leadership in a tough time, watched her save lives, took her marching orders, and as I’ve gotten to see her run, especially get involved, I just think she’s an incredibly deep candidate,” Pepper said.
Acton has been going around the state listening to people share their stories. 
“This is part of something that matters a lot to us, hearing from folks what is really going on in their life,” she said. 
Republican frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy tapped Ohio Senate President Rob McColley as his running mate earlier this week. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who appointed Acton as ODH director in 2019, endorsed Ramaswamy on Wednesday. 
Pepper said he and Acton are the change candidates. 
“Both of us are outsiders to politics in different ways,” Pepper said. “The status quo of Ohio is not working for so many people. …  I think most people want to see something different.” 
Housing affordability was a common topic that was touched on by most of the six panelists on the roundtable. 
“Affordable housing is an enormous obstacle for the people that we work with,” said Matt Heaggans, owner of Preston’s: A Burger Joint in Columbus. “We see the impacts of that on people every day and the way that it gets people off track.”
Derrick Smith, a Columbus realtor with Keller Williams, explained how about one of out every three people he works with has an older family member provide assistance to help them buy a house. 
“First time buyers are where we really need to help,” he said. 
Acton experienced homelessness as a child growing up in the Youngstown area. 
“I can tell you that housing is going to be a big issue for me,” she said. 
Acton said she hears about the rising costs of living when traveling across the state, something she said she has experienced herself. 
“I don’t live not far from here and our electric bill went up $150 this summer,” she said. “…  Rent is high, everything is high. Every one of our health care costs is going up right now.”
Harvest Pizzeria owner Chris Crader shared his concerns about the rising costs of goods. 
“You can only raise your prices so much until you price your pizza out of affordability,” he said. 
In response, Acton and Pepper took turns blaming gerrymandering. 
“What happens when you have a super gerrymandered situation?” Acton asked. “Corruption takes hold and and that’s absolutely what this election is going to be about.”  
If a state is failing in multiple areas, something else is wrong, Pepper said. 
“What’s going wrong is we have a Statehouse, it’s gerrymandered,” he said.
Ohioans are ready for change, Acton said. 
“One of the reasons I’m running for governor is I just couldn’t look the other way anymore,” she said. “People are struggling. The state keeps going backwards on every measure.” 
This is a crisis moment for so many communities, Pepper said. 
“The issues we just heard about, broader economic issues, young people leaving, direct costs, challenges everyone faces,” he said. “In terms of stepping in, I think it’s a time for us and for so many others to get involved to try and change what is a troubling direction for a country, but especially for this state.”

The only two individuals who have stood trial for their role in the largest utility corruption scandal in Ohio’s history have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their cases and reverse their convictions.


If the court accepts their case and ultimately rules in favor of the defendants, it would also likely affect two former FirstEnergy Corp. officials currently facing criminal charges in federal court as part of the multiyear House Bill 6 bailout scheme.


Such a precedent could have implications far beyond the state — and beyond the utility sector, too.


A win for the defendants could thwart any attempt to bring criminal charges against other individuals or companies that make large campaign contributions to a federal or state candidate in return for official action, such as awards of government contracts or preferred access to natural resources.


As part of the HB 6 saga, FirstEnergy and its affiliates funneled approximately $60 million through dark money groups to the tax-exempt organization Generation Now, which acted in coordination with Larry Householder’s official campaign to win reelection to the Ohio House of Representatives in 2018 and become speaker in 2019. In return, Householder used his power as speaker to push through a 2019 law to bail out two nuclear plants and two coal plants. Householder, lobbyist Matt Borges, and others then spent millions more of the FirstEnergy companies’ money to block a referendum effort to wipe out the law.


In sum, the scandal has cost Ohio ratepayers approximately half a billion dollars and delayed the state’s energy transition by gutting standards for energy efficiency and renewables and subsidizing the two 1950s-era coal plants.


 A questionable appeal

Federal agents arrested Householder, Borges, and three others in July 2020, and the government charged them with violating the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Although two individuals and Generation Now entered into plea deals and another defendant died, Householder and Borges went to trial. Jurors found them guilty in March 2023. That June, U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges received a five-year sentence.


FirstEnergy admitted its criminal liability in a 2021 court filing. Two of its former executives now face criminal charges in both federal and state courts, with the trial on the state charges set to start late this month. Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld both Borges’ and Householder’s convictions.


In petitions filed December 22, both convicted felons ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review their cases. Householder basically argues that the First Amendment protects companies giving money to candidates, and maintains that he can’t be criminally liable because his actions in connection with HB 6 carried out a campaign promise to FirstEnergy.


“That FirstEnergy had expectations attendant to the millions of dollars they donated to Householder’s 501(c)(4) is echoed by millions of Americans who make far more modest contributions to candidates — but who also expect that their candidate will come through for them,” the petition states. Letting the convictions stand would chill ​“the free exchange of ideas that the First Amendment protects, particularly in the arena of political speech,” it adds.

Borges makes similar arguments and then says that if Householder can’t be criminally liable, then neither can Borges be guilty of a criminal conspiracy under RICO.


The Department of Justice currently has until January 28 to respond to the defendants’ petitions. Four yes votes will be required from the sitting justices for the full court to hear the case.


Neither of the petitions notes that FirstEnergy’s contributions and any promises made by Householder were all secret. Money went through groups that don’t have to publicly report their donors. And Householder did not publicize an intent to push through a nuclear and coal bailout law that would have cost Ohioans more than $1 billion if all parts of it had gone into effect.


The petitions also gloss over the fact that Generation Now needed to avoid coordination with Householder’s campaign in order to avoid federal reporting and campaign finance limits, under the Supreme Court’s infamous Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission decision. Evidence at trial also showed that Householder spent some of the money for his personal benefit.


Although review of the cases is discretionary, the defendants’ arguments are already raising ire among some critics.


“Householder and Borges lamely suggest their political bribery, for which a jury of their peers found them guilty, should be excused because corruption ​‘happens every day.’ They hope the Supreme Court will turn a blind eye to bribery,” said Dick Munson, a former lobbyist for the Environmental Defense Fund who examined the HB 6 cases and other utility scandals in his 2025 book.


Yet several decisions by the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts have already weakened federal law on corruption.


After the Citizens United case paved the way for companies to give unlimited amounts to organizations that don’t have to publicly report their donors, those organizations became ripe for use in concealing the true purpose of funds. David DeVillers, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, called the case against Householder, Borges, and the others ​“likely the largest bribery money-laundering scheme ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio.”


Ashley Brown, a former commissioner of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio who was the founding executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, also noted a more recent trend of the current Supreme Court ​“to just completely disregard findings of fact in the lower courts, casually casting them aside in order to make what I regard as policy, or perhaps simply partisan, statements.”


Consequently, he said, ​“what may appear to be a slam dunk in the Householder case to most of us may be seen quite differently by the SCOTUS majority.”

(Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)If you were to make your personal Mount Rushmore of Kansas comedians, who would be on it?
The first three answers for me come quickly.
First (and second), I nominate the pair of Jason Sudeikis and Paul Rudd for their Shawnee Mission West pedigree and rise to super stardom in movies and television.
For Sudeikis, maybe your favorites include his sketches on “Saturday Night Live,” his turn as a soccer coach on “Ted Lasso” or the absurdity of “Horrible Bosses.”
My playlist for Rudd starts with his big stepbrother role in “Clueless” and marches along with his characters in “40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.”
Third, I am drafting University of Kansas grad Rob Riggle. The best goofy movies of the last few decades are on his resume: “The Hangover,” “The Other Guys,” and “Step Brothers.” (Unrelated to his bona fides, but helpful for my love of his work: We shared the same weekly waiting room outside our daughters’ dance class 15 years ago.)
My fourth slot in the Kansas comedy Mount Rushmore? 
Someone who has been making Hollywood headlines this week: Nikki Glaser.
Glaser, who graduated from KU after growing her standup career with jaunts to Kansas City, will host the Golden Globes for the second straight year Sunday. The broadcast, beginning at 7 p.m. on CBS, likely will kick off with the former Jayhawk delivering her monologue, which will likely toggle between roasting and toasting the biggest stars of movie and television.
Last year, she poked fun at …

The movie “Wicked”: “Everyone loved ‘Wicked.’ My boyfriend loved ‘Wicked.’ My boyfriend’s boyfriend loved ‘Wicked.’ ”
The mustache of actor Timothée Chalamet: “Can I just say you have the most gorgeous eyelashes … on your upper lip?”
The endless scandals of Hollywood: “I predict five years from now, when you are watching old clips of this show on YouTube, you’ll see someone in one of the crowd shots, and you’ll go, ‘That was before they caught that guy!’ ”

While Glaser grew up and now lives in the St. Louis area, she transferred to KU after visiting during a Final Four basketball weekend.
“It was the best weekend of my life,” she has said.
Majoring in English, Glaser graduated in 2006 as a woman obsessed with standup comedy. She asked her parents to support her for eight years while she refined her act.
Aside from her material for the Golden Globes, Glaser’s comedy is often unfairly labeled as simply sexual. Netflix tags her 2019 special as “no filter” and “raunchy.” Strutting the stage in a short skirt and talking about oral sex certainly steers people to that conclusion.
In 2016, Glaser told the University Daily Kansan that her comedy aims to make young women feel more confident and positive about sex.
“I know those kids are watching porn, I know those kids are seeing violent films and tons of sex — so they know what’s happening, and I would like to give them a different perspective on that stuff,” Glaser said.
So we arrive at one of my least proud parenting moments: I hit play on her 2022 stand-up special one Friday night sitting beside my daughter. I think we lasted a few minutes uncomfortably squirming in our seats as Glaser described her sex life before I nervously flicked off the TV.
Glaser, it turns out, was more ready for that talk than our family.
Glaser punctured the pop culture bubble with her 2024 roast of Tom Brady, offering a parade of jokes that burst onto social media and made headlines. Those punchlines, which skewered Brady for leaving his family and being so hot, made viewers blush or sputter — or both.
However, Glaser’s recent interviews and most recent special has shown both vulnerability and deeper meaning beyond hooking up and sex.
In lengthy interviews during 2024, she talked about her experiences with depression, eating disorders, suicidal thinking and body image. She sent Terry Gross reeling away from the microphone laughing during an interview on NPR’s “Fresh Air.”
Glaser explained how the atmosphere of the Kansas City and St. Louis comedy clubs encouraged dirty jokes. She told Gross how she would challenge herself to find out “how can you get groans? How can we offend the crowd? That was the goal, was just to say the grossest, most offensive thing.”
“So that was kind of my training ground,” she continued. “And obviously, it was more the way men talked offstage, I would say, than onstage, that made me think, ‘I just don’t want to be a part of this locker room talk where someone’s mocking me.’ ”
Glaser has also said that comedy can come from saying dark things that she shouldn’t say out loud.
“That’s always been the goal is just to mention the unmentionable,” Glaser told Gross. “And as I’ve dealt with, like, addictions and just problems with my mental health, it’s like — that’s always the answer to solving it, is admitting that there’s a problem. So it’s like, I kind of stumbled into comedy as a way to cope with all these feelings.”
Track the names of her comedy albums to see the recent change. From 2019’s “BANGIN’” to 2022’s “Good Clean Filth” to 2024’s “Someday You’ll Die.” The final special earned her 2024 Comedian of the Year from the New York Times humor columnist.
In a 2024 interview with Howard Stern, she talked about how her college years — both at KU and the University of Colorado — were times when she suffered the most psychologically, but also when she found a calling that saved her: standup comedy.
In her words, she “caught” anorexia as a teenager. Hoping to look thin for a date, she skipped all of her meals that day. Hearing from a friend that she looked great cemented the habit that would eventually threaten her life.
“The first time I did standup, I got off stage and I called my dad and I cried. We both cried,” she said. “They thought they were going to lose me. They had wrung their hands with it and given up because I wasn’t going to eat, and there was nothing they could really do with it. I was like, ‘I’ve gotta beat this because now I have something that I actually want to do and that I am good at. I have something to live for.’ ”
One of my favorite clips that I found while bouncing around the internet today on a Glaser tour was a 2019 appearance on KCTV’s “Better Kansas City.”
The production values are a lightyear away from the Golden Globes. Glaser sits on a comfy couch in an athleisure outfit with her hair pulled back in a casual ponytail. A gigantic, shiny leather chair holds the interviewer, who smiles as Glaser delivers these ambitious yet sarcastic, silly yet prophetic lines.
“I’m a really big deal,” Glaser said. “People might not know that. If you’re watching at home, like, I am going to be very famous very soon. I’m already more famous than I ever planned on being, which is not that famous. But, like, now’s the time to see me because I’m about to blow up. … Things are about to happen for me in a bigger way.”
As a longtime fan, it’s gratifying seeing Glaser explode in popularity now — at a moment when she is not just sexual on stage but intimate, not just candid in interviews but emotional.
The Golden Globes will be a fascinating showcase for a comedian with Kansas connections who is at the peak of her power.
One last note: This four-person comedy hall of fame is mine alone. So, I know that I am leaving out great folks. Here are some honorable mentions:

Del Close: A comedy innovator and mentor for many. I simply don’t know his work as well, despite his Manhattan, Kansas, roots.
Bridget Everett: I simply adore this second Manhattan honorable mention, including her willingness to be interviewed by me.
Mandy Patinkin: What a role in the “Princess Bride,” but the earnestness of his other work makes me see him as a dramatic actor.
Heidi Gardner: She has star power galore, but her biggest Kansas connection is two years at KU. I gift her to Missouri, where she belongs.
Terry Kiser: He starred in “Weekend at Bernie’s” and went to KU? That’s tempting, but can’t compete with the other filmographies.
Eric Stonestreet: I struggled the most here. Stonestreet is Kansas through and through and starred on “Modern Family.” Wish Mount Rushmore had five presidents for his sake.

(Official White House photo by Oliver Contreras)Ohio is a state built on strong communities and practical problem-solving. From church-run food programs to community organizations helping families stay afloat, our communities rely on organizations that step up when government agencies fall short.
That’s why the findings of a recent survey sponsored by Freedom and Faith Defense Project raise serious concerns as we head toward the 2026 Senate race.
According to the survey, if the 2026 congressional elections were held today, Ohio swing voters would choose a Democratic candidate by seven points. That shift alone is noteworthy in a state known for political balance. But the data also reveals why voters are moving: they see Washington overstepping, and they want elected leaders to push back.
A plurality of Ohio swing voters, 34%, believe that charities, community organizations, and religious organizations should face more general regulation. But when the question becomes specific, whether they support President Trump and Republicans in Congress increasing federal control over these groups, 47% say they oppose the idea, compared to just 22% who support it.
Ohioans know the difference between reasonable oversight and political intrusion.
The concern grows even sharper when it comes to the federal government’s recent actions. The survey shows that 60% of Ohio swing voters say the most concerning step Washington has taken is directing federal agencies to investigate and prosecute privately funded charities and religious groups for allegedly supporting domestic terrorism, often based on vague standards and limited due process.
Anyone familiar with our state’s community organizations understands why this alarms people. These are the organizations running after-school programs, providing addiction support in communities devastated by opioids, aiding struggling families, and filling gaps that government programs miss. They are not political actors, but they risk being treated like enemies if Washington’s approach continues.
The survey also found overwhelming opposition to one of the most extreme federal ideas floated in recent years: forcing banks to close accounts based on political or religious beliefs. Seventy-three percent of Ohio swing voters oppose such a policy. That level of consensus crosses every ideological line.
Ohio voters are signaling that they want leaders who will protect the independence of local charities and faith-based organizations, not leaders who will allow Washington to use its power to pressure or silence them.
This is not a partisan issue. It’s a community issue. Ohioans are rejecting the idea that federal bureaucrats should decide which ministries, community organizations, or religious groups are acceptable. They reject the notion that political winds in Washington should influence whether a local charity keeps its bank account or faces investigation.
As someone who has seen firsthand how essential these organizations are to families across Ohio, I believe we must take this moment seriously. Our next senators and representatives must commit to protecting the freedom of community organizations to serve, speak, and operate without fear of political retaliation.
The message from Ohio voters could not be clearer: Washington should support our local charities, ministries, and community organizations, not target them.

Brown",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/09/theres-no-one-that-doesnt-love-steny-official-maryland-reacts-to-hoyers-retirement/,"Tributes poured in for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), who will step down after 60 years in public office, with official Maryland recalling a friend, mentor, colleague, dedicated public servant and natural politician who left his stamp on state and national politics.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Rep. Steny hoyer (D-5th) embrace before Moore and the state's congressional delegation met Monday on Capitol Hill. Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) is on the right and U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D) is in the background on the left. Photo by Josh Kurtz.Lisa Bianco was a campaign staffer for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) from 2006 to 2012, when he was House Majority Leader, and said trying to introduce him to new people at that time posed a unique challenge.
“I used to joke that it was really hard to staff him because I’d run up and say, ‘Mr. Hoyer, I want to introduce you to so-and-so,’ and he’d say ‘Oh, of course I know them,’” said Bianco, who now works with the lobbying firm Perry Jacobson.
“He connects so well with people and it’s because it’s genuine, and it’s because he really cares about them,” she said. “He’s really invested in them, and he really is a true public servant.”
Hers was one of the many stories about Hoyer that came from Maryland’s political and community leaders Thursday after he announced from the floor of the House that he will not seek reelection this year to a 24th term in Congress. They remembered a friend, a mentor, a colleague, a dedicated public servant and a natural politician who left his stamp on state and national politics in a 60-year career.
Former Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md), whose working relationship with Hoyer dates back to 1967 when they were both in the General Assembly, called him a “loyal friend” and a decent card player in Hearts, but said one of Hoyer’s most important roles is mentor.
“We have so many new members in the Maryland Congressional delegation. He wanted to be able to help them as they started their congressional careers,” Cardin said. “Steny gives of himself every moment. And is effective in representing his people and in doing a lot of really good things. That’s a combination that’s going to be hard to duplicate.”
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) knows that from first-hand experience. Elfreth was a one-time intern in Hoyer’s office, but said she still relied on him when she became a colleague this year.

“He’s been someone I can consistently turn to, especially [during] tough moments and tough days on the floor,” Elfreth said. “I won’t know how to react or feel about the chaos down here, and I can find him on the floor, sit down and get his take on it. And inevitably, he has seen, in his six-decade career, something similar happen.”
Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), said in a social media post it would take “an entire novel” to summarize the congressman’s impact on the 5th district. In an interview Thursday, Alsobrooks recalled Hoyer was the first phone call she got after her 2010 victory as Prince George’s County state’s attorney.
“Someone handed me a phone and said, ‘You have a phone call.’ And it was the first call I received that night, and it was Steny Hoyer calling to congratulate me,” Alsobrooks said. “And from there, he has told me, any time you put your name up for office, I’m going to be there to support you.”
Hoyer was also the first person to suggest that Alsobrooks should seek federal office, about eight years ago.
“He was the person who called me on a Saturday, had me come meet him in an office, and said: ‘You know what, I think you should consider federal office,’” Alsobrooks said. “No one had ever said that to me before.”
When House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) served on the College Park City Council, from 2003-06, the city was still part of Hoyer’s 5th District.
“He’s someone that is highly respected, loved by all of us. Someone that has delivered for Maryland, has brought resources that are present in the community,” Peña-Melnyk said during an interview in her office in Annapolis. “There’s no one that doesn’t love Steny. He’s so charismatic. A hard worker, and has put Maryland on the map.”
‘A citizen again’
Hoyer’s influence in Maryland politics began in 1966 at age 27 after winning a seat in the state Senate. Nine years later, he became the youngest president in that chamber.
He was elected to the House in a special election in 1981 to represent the district that currently includes portions of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all three Southern Maryland counties of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s.
During that time, he rose to serve as No. 2 Democrat in the House.
‘We must respect and love one another’: Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring

During that time, he also had a hand in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), for the Affordable Care Act and helping former President Joe Biden (D) get the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021.
“We would not have the Americans with Disabilities Act without Steny Hoyer. We would not have the Affordable Care Act without him helping Speaker Pelosi whip those votes. We wouldn’t have the Democratic Caucus as it is, without a Steny Hoyer,” Elfreth said.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a statement that “Steny Hoyer’s fingerprints have been on countless pieces of historic policy achievements.” His impact on the 5th District is unmistakable, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.)
“If you sort of drive through his congressional district and look out both sides of the window, you’re going to see something that Steny Hoyer helped make happen,” Van Hollen said.
One of Hoyer’s top achievements for Maryland was leading the effort to get the General Services Administration to relocate the aging FBI headquarters from Washington, D.C., to a site in Greenbelt, after 10 years of studies and battling Virginia officials who wanted the headquarters built in Springfield, Virginia.
But that achievement is in peril after President Donald Trump (R) announced last year that FBI headquarters, and its 6,000 employees, would stay in downtown Washington, D.C. A Republican-controlled Senate committee approved a resolution in October to help make it happen.
About a week later in November, Hoyer joined Gov. Wes Moore (D), Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and others to announce the state had sued the administration to stop an action that would “unlawfully sabotage a multiyear collaborative effort” to relocate the facility to Greenbelt.
Hoyer said in an interview Thursday he will continue to challenge the Trump administration over the FBI move.
“The reason why the site is being changed has nothing to do with the suitability for the FBI, and everything to do with the animus that the president of the United Sates directs towards the FBI, and frankly towards Prince George’s County,” he said. “I’m going to try keep to convincing my colleagues in Congress that a short-term political decision is harmful in this case.”
Thursday’s announcement by Hoyer, 86, follows a similar announcement by 85-year-old Pelosi, the Baltimore-born Democrat who has represented California in the House for more than three decades. Pelosi will also step down at the end of her term in January 2027.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
During part of his 10-minute speech, Hoyer choked up a few times. He had a quick reply when asked what brought that on.
“The past 65 years,” he said. “I have been involved in an enterprise that I really enjoy. I love the interface with the public. I love the interface with the fellow members of the state Senate, or state Board of Higher Education, or the Congress of the United States.”
Hoyer continued: “I love working on behalf of communities and people to try to make their lives better and make the communities more successful. When you’re ending that and walking into a much slower pace of life, which my wife is going to enjoy. It was emotional. When you do something for a long time and you like it, and you decide to walk away voluntarily … it has an emotional tug on you.”

“We never flinched,” said Beck, who threw for 268 yards and two touchdowns with an interception. “In the face of adversity, when we had to respond, we responded.”

The 10th-ranked Hurricanes (13-2) didn’t play in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game and were a somewhat controversial CFP pick – at least outside of South Florida – yet proved they belong. They will face either top-ranked Indiana or No. 5 Oregon in the national title game on Jan. 19.
Miami held Texas A&M and reigning national champion Ohio State to a combined 17 points to reach the CFP semifinals. Then the Hurricanes shut down the high-scoring Rebels (13-2) for three quarters in the desert before pulling it out in a wild fourth.

Trinidad Chambliss, a year removed from winning a Division II title at Ferris State, led the Rebels down the field and found Dae’Quan Wright for a 24-yard touchdown with 3:13 left.
Then it was Beck’s turn. He won a national title as a backup at Georgia before two productive seasons as the Bulldogs’ starter. Beck kept the Hurricanes calm amid the storm, leading them down the field for the winning score — and a shot at a national title on their home field at Hard Rock Stadium. Beck is 37-5 as a starter, including two seasons at Georgia.
“He’s hungry, he’s driven, he’s a great human being, and all he wants to do is to see his teammates have success,” said Mario Cristobal, in his fourth season coaching his alma mater. “And that’s what we witnessed tonight.”

Chambliss completed two passes to get Ole Miss to the Miami 35 with 6 seconds left, but his heave to the end zone fell incomplete as time expired.
The sixth-seeded Rebels lost their coach before the playoff, but not their cool.
If anything, Lane Kiffin’s decision to bolt for LSU seemed to harden Ole Miss’ resolve, pushing the Rebels to the best season in school history — and within a game of their first national championship game.
Ole Miss took the lead on Lucas Caneiro’s fourth field goal, from 21 yards, and seemed poised to continue its improbable run with Chambliss’ TD pass to Wright.

The Rebels couldn’t hold back the Hurricanes on their final drive, but what a run it was.
With Pete Golding calling the shots after being promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach, and most of the assistants sticking around, the Rebels blew out Tulane to open the playoff and took down mighty Georgia in the CFP quarterfinals.
They faced a different kind of storm in the Hurricanes.
Miami has rekindled memories of its 2001 national championship team behind a defense that went from porous to nearly impenetrable in its first season under coordinator Corey Hetherman.
The Hurricanes walled up early in the Fiesta Bowl, holding Ole Miss to minus-1 yard.

One play revved up the Rebels and their rowdy fans.
Kewan Lacy, the nation’s third-leading rusher, burst through a hole up the middle for a 73-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter — the longest run allowed by Miami’s defense since 2018.
The Hurricanes seemed content to grind away at the Rebels in small chunks offensively, setting up CharMar Brown’s 4-yard touchdown run and a field goal.
Miami unlocked the deep game just before halftime, taking advantage of a busted coverage for a 52-yard touchdown pass from Beck to Keelan Marion.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)A federal judge ruled this week that Florida violated the constitutional rights of hundreds of thousands of people it had removed from the Medicaid rolls following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, when it sent beneficiaries “vague, confusing and often incorrect and misleading” termination letters.
In a 273-page ruling in the class action, U.S. District Judge Marcia Morales Howard ordered the state in the next two months to send appropriate Medicaid termination notices to roughly 500,000 low-income people whose benefits the state terminated for financial reasons following the pandemic and were not subsequently re-enrolled in the safety-net health care program.
The notice must advise the people of the court’s ruling and, at a minimum, must include “an unambiguous statement” explaining the financial reasons behind the terminations and to whom the decision applies. 
“Such notice will ensure that all Class Members have the information needed to determine whether the State’s decision to terminate their Medicaid benefits was correct,” she wrote. “Class Members who believe the State made an error may then pursue the available administrative remedies to correct that error.”
Those “remedies” include an opportunity to request an administrative appeal of their termination, which would enable someone to temporarily be re-enrolled in Medicaid pending the outcome of the hearing. The notice must include information about administrative procedures permitting the payment of past medical bills if an error is found.

Howard in her ruling also barred the Department of Children and Families — the Florida agency that determines whether people qualify for Medicaid — from terminating someone’s benefits for financial eligibility unless it provides proper notice. 
That notice must include must include, at a minimum the enrollee’s household size, the state-determined countable household income; the eligibility category in which the enrollee had been receiving benefits, and, if it changed, the reason for the change. 
The DCF did not immediately comment on the ruling or whether it plans to appeal the decision. 
“Welcome news”
Joan Alker executive director and co-founder of the Center for Children and Families (CCF) and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy.
Center for Children and Families Executive Director Joan Alker said Thursday she still was reading the lengthy ruling but that she wasn’t surprised by the judge’s conclusions.
Alker, who has spent more than 20 years studying Florida’s Medicaid program, said the state has a “really complicated” Medicaid system, which includes the optional Medicaid expansion for children called Kidcare. The more complicated the system, she said, the more important it is for termination letters to be easily understood.
“I think it’s welcome news for families that, here, the judge recognized that this was a very serious problem that families were facing,” she said. “And again, I’ll say that I found the notices extremely difficult to understand and, obviously, I’m a health policy professor who’s been working on this stuff for decades.”
Medicaid is a safety net health care program jointly administered and paid for by the state and federal governments. Just under 4 million people were enrolled in Medicaid in Florida as of Nov. 30, 2025, the latest available data.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government increased by 6.2% its contributions to the Medicaid program. The increased funding came with the caveat that states couldn’t disenroll people during the pandemic.
The policy ballooned Florida’s Medicaid caseload from 3.8 million people in March 2020, before to the pandemic, to more than  5.75 million in March 2023. 
Congress agreed the continuous eligibility requirement would end March 31, 2023, and that, post-pandemic, states could return their Medicaid programs to their normal operations. That process was known as Medicaid “unwinding.”
Florida started its Medicaid unwinding on April 1, 2023, and by the following year DCF redetermined the Medicaid eligibility of more than 4 million people.
Attorneys for Florida Health Justice Project and the National Health Law Program filed the lawsuit in Jacksonville in 2023 on behalf of people who erroneously lost benefits. Howard agreed to certify it as a class action in 2024.
“This ruling is a victory for the millions of Floridians who rely on Medicaid for essential health care. Medicaid agencies inevitably make mistakes when deciding eligibility. Clear, easy-to-understand notices are essential to catch and correct those mistakes before someone loses health care. The Court’s decision will ensure that Floridians have that critical protection from now on,”  Sarah Grusin, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program. said in a prepared statement Thursday.
“It also underscores that states cannot shirk their constitutional obligations. Florida has known about the problems with their notices for years but has not addressed them, citing the cost and complexity of making changes to the computer system that generates notices. But as the Court emphasized, state officials cannot justify violating the constitutional rights of their citizens because they claim the fix is too expensive.”

“Poorest of the poor”
There are two broad category groups: “SSI-Related Medicaid” for people who are aged, blind, or disabled in the community, and “Family-Related Medicaid” for children, parents, and other caretakers of children, pregnant women, and former foster children under the age of 26.
The lawsuit focuses on “Family Related Medicaid” beneficiaries, whom Howard described as some of the state’s “most vulnerable citizens.”
“They are primarily pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children. And as is evident from the applicable income standards, these individuals are the poorest of the poor,” Howard said. “Prior to terminating the Medicaid benefits on which these individuals depend, the Constitution requires the State of Florida to provide them with adequate notice. The State of Florida is violating this constitutional requirement. “
Regardless of the eligibility group, residents also must meet certain income requirements, which vary by, among other things, age and household composition. 
The complicated details of how household income is derived are laid out in policy manuals which, Howard noted in her ruling, are “plainly designed for internal use by those who have been taught how to use it … .” 
Howard’s lengthy ruling also touches on the DCF call center operations and its website.
Florida wrongly kicked postpartum women and their newborns out of Medicaid

Using April 2024 as an example, Howard noted, the call center received more than 1.9 million phone calls, of which 593,923 were resolved with interactive voice response system through which people can self serve.
Another 1.38 million-plus callers asked to speak with an agent for a variety of reasons, including long wait times and abandoned phone calls; only 32% ( 444,319 callers) who requested to speak with a live agent succeeded. Upon reaching an agent, those interactions lasted for an average of nine minutes and 28 seconds, including the time the agent spent working on the case after the call ended. 
Meanwhile, termination letters referred resident to the DCF website to learn more about eligibility requirements, but Howard noted in her ruling that the webpage didn’t provide all the information people needed or the links to get the information. In some instances, information on DCF’s homepage was incorrect or incomplete. 
“The length of this Order might suggest that the question before the Court — whether the State’s notices are constitutionally adequate — is overly complex or a razor close call. It is neither. The length of this Order is not reflective of the complexity of the legal issue, it is reflective of the complexity and unreasonably confusing nature of the notices. It is driven by the need to address the complete inadequacy and borderline incomprehensibility of the notices and the inadequacy of the other resources identified as remedying the failure of the NOCAs [notices of case action] at issue,” she wrote.
“As detailed in this Order, the Court’s review of the evidence and the notices — their structure, the confusing, contradictory, and often misleading reasons they provide, and the lack of alternate available sources for the necessary information — inescapably leads to the conclusion that the State’s notices are fundamentally insufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.”

The first time I walked into a Connecticut drive-thru, I realized something that shocked my younger self: I missed home because I missed the food. Connecticut may pride itself on being the Pizza Capital of the United States, but for anyone raised in the South, that crown doesn’t solve the state’s biggest problem — it lacks the fast-food culture that keeps everyday meals fun, comforting and quick. 



Before Nutmeggers fire their ovens to defend New Haven, let me acknowledge the obvious: Connecticut has world-class pizza. The state is so proud of it that the governor’s office issued a press release doubling down on the title, even noting that there are 1,376 pizza restaurants statewide and 63 in New Haven alone.
And yes, the pies are incredible. Many are handmade, cooked in old ovens and worth the wait. 
But that’s the point: You have to wait. A lot. 
Most weekends, you’ll stand in line at Pepe’s longer than it takes to drive from New Britain to Hartford. Connecticut pizza may be extraordinary, but it’s not fast food. And it can’t replace what the South does best: comfort meals you can get in minutes. 
As a North Carolina native now living in Connecticut, here are three things this state needs to truly level up its food game: 

 A legendary fast-food chain — ideally Bojangles.

Southerners don’t go to Bojangles. We return to it. It’s fried chicken that tastes like home, biscuits you can’t replicate, and seasoned fries that make road trips worth it. 

Max Frazier

Connecticut may not realize it, but people here miss it too. Some residents literally drive from Connecticut to North Carolina just for Bojangles, as shown in this Reddit thread from transplanted Southerners longing for a “Bojangles fix.” Another Reddit post raves about trying Bojangles for the first time. 
Even YouTube creators have jumped in, praising the chain with videos like this review of its famous chicken and biscuits. 
There’s also a full breakdown of the chain’s significance in “The Untold Truth of Bojangles,” which you can read here. For an outside perspective, a Connecticut-based writer included Bojangles in a ranking of the best Southern chains.
And recently, Bojangles made business news when reports suggested the company is up for sale — a reminder of how culturally important it is to its fans.
Bottom line: Bojangles has more than 800 locations across 17 states, a loyal fan base and a flavor profile the Northeast simply doesn’t match. 

 More variety. The South’s fast-food universe is huge.

A writer who lived in both New England and the South described the contrast clearly in this Business Insider piece: “The fast-food options are seemingly endless in the South.”
North Carolina has Cook Out, Zaxby’s, Biscuitville, Smithfield’s Chicken ’N Bar-B-Q, and more. Connecticut has far fewer regional chains, meaning fewer signature flavors and fewer low-cost comfort foods. It’s not just about fried chicken — it’s about choice. 

 A stronger culture of quick, flavorful meals.

Fast food in N.C. isn’t just food — it’s rhythm. It’s grabbing a Cajun Filet Biscuit before school, hitting Cook Out after a late game or stopping at Bojangles on road trips because you know exactly what that first bite will taste like. Connecticut leans heavily on sit-down meals and pizza culture. Great traditions, but not always practical for families, students or workers looking for fast, inexpensive meals on the go. 
The Counterargument: But Connecticut Has Pizza. 
True — Connecticut has some of the best pizza in the country, and locals love it fiercely. But pizza isn’t filling the same role Bojangles does in North Carolina. It’s not a drive-thru meal; it’s not a cultural touchstone, and it doesn’t come with a sweet tea strong enough to fix a bad day. Pizza can be phenomenal while still leaving a gap in the food landscape. 
The Solution 
It’s time for Connecticut to welcome a major Southern chain, ideally Bojangles, and embrace the culture that comes with it. Even a single location would bring new flavors, new customers, new jobs and maybe even a new sense of identity around quick comfort food. Connecticut doesn’t have to stop loving pizza. But it can expand its palate — and its drive-thru options. 
Because here’s the truth that no Connecticut resident wants to hear from a Southerner: Your pizza is amazing. But you have no idea how good life can be with a Bo-Berry Biscuit.

CT DOT is considering it” outlined a DOT proposal to widen the section of Interstate 95 in Stamford. In a time of great progress for our small state, we are apparently back to an era of regressivism. 
After the signing of HB 8002, we can now finally see the future of Connecticut housing plans. Front and center of this bill was the focus on transit oriented development, something that this administration has been focused on. This is great news for people living in our cities who understand the need for safe and pedestrian-first streets.
It has been too long in this nation that we put automobiles first, and finally, we have hit a turning point where they will continue to rule no longer. The discussion of another lane being added to our interstate is an absurd attack on our cities and societies. The “one more lane” mentality lent us the destruction of much of our downtown areas in Stamford, Bridgeport, New Haven, and most notably, Hartford. The highway has tormented our society, and we should not continue to support these massive superhighway projects. Our state has vowed to do better for the people, not the automobiles. Cars are not your taxpayers; we are –the 3.6 million Nutmeggers who call this state home.
There is a consensus among planners that adding one more lane will never and has never fixed traffic; the only solution is getting people off the roads in the first place by way of transit. Instead of adding a lane of the highway at a cost of $10 million per mile, the state could make dedicated busways across our state that will improve the roads for the thousands (and growing) that use our buses every day. The effect that would have on commuters would benefit more people than any highway infrastructure spending ever could. Planning and adding paint reading “Bus Only” to our streets is much more cost-effective than appending to an already enormous concrete structure that divides communities.
The people of Connecticut want our tax dollars to be spent in ways that improve our lives for the best value, exactly what state government should look like. Our state has been here for us recently when our federal government let us down; the state cannot afford to lose the trust of the people like it had eight years ago. 
They must continue their course of good. I hope that common sense will prevail and shut down the discussion of this for the last time because, “Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need [more] roads!”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)At a protest Thursday in the neighborhood where an immigration officer killed Renee Nicole Good Wednesday, Omar Dasea-Torres said he joined the demonstration even though he fears for his own safety despite his legal status.
“I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing right now, taking families,” Dasea-Torres said.
Over a thousand people joined Dasea-Torres Thursday. They walked the streets under a steady, cold rain, blocking traffic, blocks away from where Good, 37, was fatally shot Wednesday morning by a federal immigration agent who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune.
Many protestors likely have vivid memories of days of demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd, less than a mile from here.
Minneapolis residents have borne the brunt of the latest wave of immigration agents — said to be 2,000 — sent to Minnesota this week by the Department of Homeland Security.
No federal or local law enforcement appeared to be present at the Thursday evening protest. Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the Minnesota National Guard “out of an abundance of caution” to be prepared to help local law enforcement keep order.

Protests have been ongoing since the shooting. Protesters gathered at the scene immediately after the shooting; later that evening, thousands gathered to mourn Good in an evening vigil and a protest against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
Early Thursday morning, protesters clashed with federal agents at the Whipple Building, the federal building ICE has been using. The Star Tribune reported that agents threw some protesters to the ground and detained them; one protester was detained for throwing an apple core at a squad car.
And later that morning, more than 100 multifaith religious leaders huddled around the site of the shooting, which has been turned into a memorial for Good, to make three demands: that ICE leave Minnesota; that the federal government allow state investigators access to evidence for an independent state investigation; and that Congress also investigate the shooting.
A speech written by Jovita Morales from the Minnesota Immigrant Movement opened the Thursday evening protest, which was jointly organized and publicized on social media by local chapters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, 50501 and the Democratic Socialists of America.
“The incident in which an ICE agent took the life of our community member and a young woman demonstrates a complete lack of preparation and serious negligence. We demand justice through an investigation,” said Ivonne Hernandez, who delivered the speech on behalf of Morales.
On Wednesday, the feds kicked Minnesota criminal investigators off what was initially a joint investigation. The maneuver has drawn sharp criticism from local officials and protesters, who demanded an investigation independent from the federal government, whose top officials have already publicly drawn conclusions that contradict existing video evidence.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday that Good “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.” A video provided to the Reformer shows an officer positioning himself in front of the vehicle and firing three shots through the windshield as Good attempted to turn the car away from the officer.
Ben Andrews wasn’t aware of the protest in advance but saw it passing by his house. Andrews said he’s been receiving neighborhood notifications of ICE presence “semi-regularly.”
“This used to be a great neighborhood. This neighborhood was going up. All this ICE sh*t doesn’t make anybody better,” Andrews said.

(Photo by Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — More than 150 people gathered Thursday night in front of the Statehouse to protest the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and an agent’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis. 
Organizers from the South Carolina chapters of 50501 and the Party for Socialism and Liberation gave brief speeches before leading most of the crowd on a 0.6-mile march to Columbia City Hall and back. 
Police cars blocked off portions of Main Street as the crowd walked, chanting slogans condemning Wednesday’s killing of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three who was shot through the windshield by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Police cars also followed the walkers. 
The protest in the state capital remained peaceful and lasted for about two hours. 
It began along Gervais Street on the sidewalk in front of the Statehouse, with people waving American flags and holding signs with slogans including “stop ICE terror” and “stop attacking U.S. citizens.” People honked their horns as they drove by.
Samantha Rainwater of Columbia, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told the SC Daily Gazette that the group marched to city hall to discourage Columbia leaders from signing agreements with ICE or expanding its presence in the city.
Across South Carolina, 19 counties, 10 cities and two state law enforcement agencies participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, named for the section of a 1996 law that authorized it. They do not include Columbia or Richland County. The most recent participant, Elloree Police Department in Orangeburg County, signed on Wednesday, according to ICE’s website.
Minnesota and national leaders have disagreed sharply on the circumstances surrounding Good’s death, which has prompted large protests in Minneapolis and across the country. 
Video of the shooting shared with the Minnesota Reformer, an affiliate of the Gazette, shows officers approaching a vehicle stopped in the middle of a snowy road. One yells at her to get out and tries to open the door. Good slowly backs up, then pulls forward as she begins to drive away. An officer at the front of the vehicle, identified in court records as Jonathan Ross, shoots three times. 
At a news conference Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the officer acted in self-defense. She alleged Good was attempting to kill him with her vehicle, which she called an “act of domestic terrorism.” Vice President JD Vance continued Thursday to call it self-defense.
Sigourney Howell, a 27-year-old EMT who lives in Sumter, said she came to the protest because she worries about what’s next for America. What can be seen and heard on video doesn’t match what officials are saying, she said.
Brenda Peake said she came from Rock Hill to join the Statehouse protest because she believes the government is lying about what happened to Good, and she couldn’t stay quiet. 
“You look at the videos and you can see that she’s trying to get away,” said the 77-year-old, who used to work for the North Carolina Department of Corrections. “As a female, I know if a guy in a mask and a big gun came up to my car, I would try to get away. It’s just an instinct.”

Spencer Cox and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz sign an agreement giving Utah a greater role in managing national forest land, at the Utah Capitol on Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo courtesy of Gov. Spencer Cox's office). Utah has had more than 7 million acres of national forest for over a century but not the say it wanted in managing them. That changed Thursday morning when the state finalized a new agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, intended in part to expand logging. 
“This is something we’ve been working for — wanting — literally, for generations in our state,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said at the state Capitol before signing the document. “And now the moment is here where we can be involved on the front end of these decisions.”
Utah is the third state to formalize such an agreement with the Forest Service this year, following Idaho and Montana. The compacts come after President Donald Trump directed federal agencies in March to speed approval of logging projects and set goals for timber sales, calling it a way to reduce wildfire risk. 
Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz joined Cox at the Capitol to sign the agreement. He said it provides the state “a seat at the table, side by side,” rather than simply a chance to give input in how the lands are managed.
“The term I like is cooperative federalism, but there’s a role for the states to manage federal lands, and that’s what we’re doing here today,” Schultz said.

Conservation groups blasted the agreement as Utah’s latest move to assume greater control of public lands. They said it sets the stage for a vast expansion of commercial logging.  
“They’re just using wildfire as an excuse to manage in a way that gives money to the timber industry,” said Laura Welp with the Western Watersheds Project. 
Welp said supporters of the new arrangement overstate the benefits of removing timber in reducing wildfire. She noted the influence of weather, high winds, drought and climate change. Habitat restoration, which involves smaller-scale operations, can be used to manage risk, she said, rather than big commercial logging projects. 
Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said the change “sets the stage for Utah officials to have both a heavy hand and the loudest voice in how our national forests are managed, crowding out all other stakeholders. That’s not how this is supposed to work, and we’ll be watching closely to see how the agreement plays out on the ground.”
Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, rejected the notion that the deal is a gift to the timber industry. 
“I wouldn’t agree with that,” he said. “I mean, certainly, we take our environment very seriously. We care for it. It’s part of who we are.” 
In April, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins declared a crisis on national forest lands, citing severe wildfires and other stressors “compounded by too little active management.” Rollins directed the Forest Service to expand agreements with states “to bring the full power of our partners to help address this emergency.”
Before Thursday, Utah and the Forest Service have long had more limited compacts, Ferry told reporters after the event.   
Thursday’s version goes further than Idaho’s and Montana’s, making Utah a partner in decisions about logging, cattle grazing, recreation, wildlife and forest restoration, Ferry said.

Leland Pollock, a rancher and chair of the Garfield County Commission, attended the announcement and looked on as Cox and Schulz signed the agreement. He’s long advocated for reduced federal oversight of public lands, including the downsizing of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. 
Asked if he sees the new framework as a step toward greater state control of other public lands like national monuments, Pollock laughed, saying, “Oh, hell, no, don’t say that.” 
“We’re not going to make the forest unhealthy or worse,” he said. “We’re going to make it better.” 
The agreement applies to more than 8 million acres of national forest and adjacent land in Utah. It does not pertain to other vast stretches of federally managed land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service.

(Justin Taylor/The Current GA/Catchlight Local/Report for America)The seven Democratic candidates vying to become governor addressed Coastal Georgia voters Thursday in the first major policy forum of the election year, with each aiming to distinguish themselves amid a crowded race for the state’s top job.
Georgia Democrats are hoping that the lack of incumbent — current Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, will leave office at the end of 2026 due to term limits — and rising economic difficulties will boost their party’s chances of winning the powerful position for the first time in more than 20 years.
The seven Democrats who took the stage were former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; Olu Brown, a businessman and retired pastor; former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan; former state Sen. Jason Esteves, who also runs three family businesses; state Rep. Derrick Jackson, a U.S Navy veteran and former General Electric official; community activist and state Rep. Ruwa Romman; and former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

While the group presented a diverse range of ages, race, professional experience and socioeconomic backgrounds, the candidates sounded very similar when it came to policy positions, leaving it unclear how they will ultimately differentiate themselves for party faithful who vote in the May primary.
The one-hour event held at Savannah’s Jonesville Baptist Church allowed candidates to introduce themselves and highlight their credentials to run the state, yet covered only four main topics: health care, economic development and workforce training, the Trump administration and housing.
The format allowed for one-minute answers and discouraged criticism or debate among the candidates. Candidates’ answers, as a result, sounded very similar. Everyone promised to expand Medicaid as a way to help increase health care coverage, a policy that Gov. Kemp and the Republican-led legislature have rejected although 40 other states have adopted. Each person proposed expanding an affordable housing fund and rental assistance to help improve home ownership and help Georgians build stable futures. They also all agreed that technical training and community college should be free to all adults in the state.
Time did not allow for expansive discussions of how to pay for these programs, but many candidates suggested using some of Georgia’s $14 billion budget surplus for these efforts.
Organizers said they chose the format to promote civility and thoughtful answers for the top concerns of Coastal Georgia voters. Organizers were also unabashed in reminding candidates that any victory to statewide office would require engagement from voters outside of Atlanta.
“Chatham County is one of the largest counties in the state, and the 1st Congressional District is a big part of Georgia’s economy and growth. We want folks to take us as a region seriously,” Chatham County Commissioner Aaron “Adot” Whitely, chairman of the Democratic Party of Chatham County.

Ahead of the forum, two of the area’s most influential Democrats got roaring standing ovations from the approximately 1,000 attendees in the church sanctuary: Alicia Johnson, the Savannah native and new member of the Public Service Commission whose electoral victory in November made her the first Black woman to win a statewide race in Georgia, and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson. The two officials are not related, and both are expected to help turn out the vote, both in the spring primary and in November, for all Democrats running for state office.
Bottoms, the former Atlanta mayor, is a close ally and friend of the Savannah leader. While he has not formally endorsed her, she used her closing statement to call him out by name on the stage.
Johnson, however, confirmed to The Current after the forum that he had not made a decision about which candidate he would back. “Several of the candidates are friends of mine,” the mayor said.
The Democratic forum was the first in a planned “Savannah Debate Series” being organized by the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Savannah Black Chamber of Commerce, the Chatham County Democratic Party and the Chatham County Republican Party, as well as local news station WJCL. The group plans to hold a Republican gubernatorial forum in the spring, followed by a general election debate between the party nominees for the governor’s race later this year.
March 6 is the last day for candidates to qualify to run for the November election. Primaries to select the Democratic and Republican nominees for governor, as well as other state offices, and U.S. Senator will take place on May 19.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A trio of bills targeting local cooperation with federal immigration agents and expanding protections for immigrants is expected to go before the full Legislature Monday after they advanced through two legislative committees Thursday.
The package of bills is being fast-tracked after a similar measure languished for more than a year. Senate President Nicholas Scutari told reporters that he plans to support them, though he worries about the proposals making New Jersey a target of the federal government.
“I fear for the people that are advocating for this getting what they ask for, and maybe it’s not exactly what they expect. I think it could have unintended consequences for lots of folks,” Scutari said Thursday ahead of the bills clearing committees.

The bills’ advancement came a day after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis during a civil immigration enforcement operation. Sen. Britnee Timberlake (D-Essex) said that the “killing of a young, 37-year-old mother, American citizen, white woman, blonde hair, shows that this can happen to everyone.”
“What the federal government is directing for ICE to carry out is wrong, and I do believe and look for a day in the future where history will speak for itself and that those who are carrying out these illegal acts will find themselves in the same position as those who carried out the illegal acts in Nazi Germany through the Nuremberg trials,” Timberlake said. “It’s wrong what we’re seeing, and these bills are just a slight step in the right direction to try to protect our citizens as much as we can.”
The legislation was passed late Thursday in the Assembly Appropriations Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee with opposition from the Republicans on both panels.
“This just promotes lawlessness and makes our state less safe,” said Assemblyman Greg Myhre (R-Ocean).
The White House last week issued a statement criticizing the Legislature for moving the bills and saying the body should “focus on protecting law-abiding citizens, not the criminal aliens who kill them.”
The package of bills includes legislation to codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, an attorney general order that limits cooperation between federal immigration authorities and New Jersey law enforcement. The bill would bar police officers from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” like stopping someone based on their suspected citizenship status; require agencies to develop procedures for certain visa requests; and mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences of some charges and convictions.
The second measure would require the state to develop policies for “sensitive locations” — like some health care centers, schools, and shelters — that would prohibit federal civil immigration enforcement on the premises. The third bill would bar government entities and health care facilities from asking for certain personal information, like immigration status, in some cases.
Immigrant advocates have been urging lawmakers to codify the protections for immigrants, pointing to the drastic increase in immigration enforcement and the fact that any future attorney general could withdraw the directive.
Dozens of people testified Thursday during the hourslong hearings, and the vote in the Assembly came just before 9 p.m. Witnesses shared stories of immigrant residents who fear federal agents, children who have come home to find their parents were arrested, and businesses that have suffered as a result of the fear of authorities.
“Laws like this are necessary to build a firewall against an unaccountable, militarized deportation force. But we’re under no illusions that this will be enough. The federal administration will keep coming, and New Jersey will need to stay ready with additional protections as new threats emerge,” said Nedia Morsy, director of immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey.
The bills will likely go before the Senate and Assembly on Monday. Gov. Phil Murphy, whose final day in office is Jan. 20, declined to say Thursday whether he would sign or veto them.
Republican legislators voiced concerns about the bills regulating the federal government, which is barred by the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause. Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson), a sponsor of the bill, waved away that criticism.
“Counties sued us, Trump administration 1.0 sued us — sequels are often worse, and I would say this one definitely is — but the U.S. District Court of New Jersey upheld the directive. The 3rd Circuit affirmed it,” he said. “This is legal, and Congress can regulate the conduct of private actors, but they can’t make the states use their resources to do the job of federal immigration enforcement.”
Timberlake added: “They can bring in their own resources to do it.”

Josh Shapiro speaks at a rally in Philadelphia where he and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis kicked off their 2026 reelection campaign, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Kicking off their campaign for a second term, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis offered a vision where Pennsylvanians have abundant opportunities for success, affordable and safe communities and the rights and freedoms they value.
At rallies Thursday in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Shapiro and Davis revisited their successes and the work left to do as the commonwealth and the nation face foundational challenges amid what the governor called “chaos and the toxicity” in the nation’s capital.
“We’ve got more people to help, and we’ve got more problems to solve,” Shapiro told the crowd gathered at a youth basketball center in Philadelphia. “And so with a servant’s heart and an ear to your concerns, progress made, and with a hunger to do more for you, I am here to announce that I am running for reelection as governor of this great commonwealth.”
But Shapiro said he could not tout the administration’s success without acknowledging that Pennsylvania families are suffering because of the Republican-controlled federal government’s cuts to food assistance and health insurance tax credits.
“Some politicians who know better — are too cowardly to speak up. They abandoned their principles … and in an attempt to position themselves to be better off, they leave a whole lot of others behind,” he said, noting that nearly 500,000 Pennsylvanians will be unable to afford health insurance and more than 100,000 will lose SNAP benefits.
During his speech, Shapiro had to pause several times as the crowd in Philadelphia — about 1,000, according to the campaign’s estimate — spontaneously chanted an earthier version of the campaign catchphrase “get stuff done.” Shapiro used the slogan several times as he outlined accomplishments during his first three years in the governor’s office.

They included the state response to the Interstate 95 disaster that defined the early months of his term, to increases in education funding approaching 30%, eliminating red tape involved in starting a business and hiring 2,000 new state troopers, attracting $35 billion in new private investments and eliminating a college degree requirement for 92% of state jobs. 
“I’m running for reelection to continue that work, and I’m running for reelection because I have never backed down from a fight,” he said, adding, “Right now, we are in a battle to protect the very foundation upon which the place we call home was founded.”
With prices for food, energy, vehicles and other goods soaring, businesses and families are struggling and farmers without markets for their products, Shapiro said the federal government’s actions threaten to erode progress in the commonwealth.
He added that he feels Pennsylvanians’ worries about feeding their families and being stripped of their rights.
“Every step of the way, I’ve stood up for my fellow Pennsylvanians, sometimes in a court of law, and other times by simply refusing to back down, refusing to cast certain Pennsylvanians aside, and always by speaking truth to power,” Shapiro said.
Davis said the campaign wasn’t about him and Shapiro but the potential of state government when it invests and believes its people.
“It’s about being honest and clear eyed and honest about what this moment calls for and the leadership it takes to meet it, because things are very different from when Josh and I were first elected,” Davis said. 
“The stakes are higher than they’ve ever been and we all have a choice to make — follow the politics of fear and division coming from politicians in Washington,” Davis said. “Or we can stand up for our freedom, make our own choices and show the nation what’s possible when great leadership is at the helm.”
Elected in 2022, Shapiro already carried formidable political clout as the sitting state attorney general in his first gubernatorial run. He stood out nationally by suing the first Trump administration over its policies and companies that profited from the broad adoption of opioid painkillers that led to an epidemic of overdose deaths. Shapiro was also a Montgomery County commissioner and a state representative.

Davis was in his second term as a state representative in Allegheny County representing his hometown of McKeesport when he became the commonwealth’s first Black lieutenant governor.
They defeated state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Frankllin), a Trump loyalist and election denier who has introduced legislation to outlaw chemtrails, by 15 points or nearly 800,000 votes. Mastriano announced Wednesday that he would not run for governor again, telling supporters in a livestream with his wife Rebbie, that “God has not called us to run …  this year.”
State Treasurer Stacy Garrity is the likely 2026 Republican nominee to challenge Shapiro. Garrity, who called on state lawmakers to decertify the 2020 election results, is campaigning on her success in returning unclaimed money and property held by the state and her expansion of education savings accounts. 
But her campaign has also indicated that it plans to attack Shapiro on a Philadelphia stabbing case his office reviewed in 2018, when he was attorney general. Shapiro said his office reached the same conclusion as the Philadelphia medical examiner’s office, which has since walked back its conclusion that 27-year-old Ellen Greenburg’s death was suicide despite the finding of 27 stab wounds.
The Shapiro administration has failed to achieve some of the tentpole goals he talked about in the 2022 campaign, including school vouchers – a key goal of Republican lawmakers.

Good, a 37-year-old award-winning poet and mother, was shot and killed Wednesday. Her death has sparked national outrage, touching off protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country.
CCB Plaza in downtown Durham began to fill up with protesters just before dark. Many of them chanted protest slogans and carried signs condemning the shooting death of Good, as well as President Trump’s invasion of Venezuela and what they believe are the president’s attacks on democracy.
Sharon Jamison attended the rally to protest ICE, whom she contends is “kidnapping and murdering” people. Jamison said she hopes the protest in Durham and others across the country will eventually bring change.
“The hope is that over time, with enough protests, we can take momentum into the midterm elections and really flip things around and vote people out who are anti-democracy,” Jamison said. 
“She [Good] was a defender of immigrant rights. She was a mother,” said Alex Trejo, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation. “She was killed, murdered by an ICE agent named Jonathan Ross. The video evidence confirms this was a cold-blooded killing,” 
Trejo said any claim that Ross acted in self-defense is an “outrageous lie.” He said Democratic leaders must aggressively pursue justice.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has alleged Good refused a command to get out of her vehicle before she tried to run over and kill Ross. Noem contends Good committed an act of “domestic terrorism” and is backing Ross’ decision to shoot and kill her.
Noem’s account of the shooting has been disputed by Minneapolis officials and Gov. Tim Walz, as well as by many media organizations who have reviewed several videos of the encounter by observers and bystanders.
The shooting death in Minneapolis comes amid ramped up immigration enforcement actions in the city. The Trump administration has targeted Somali Americans, whom he has said are “destroying” the country. He has deployed 2,000 federal agents to the city in the wake of alleged fraud by members of the Somali community.  
North Carolina was also recently targeted by DHS for immigration enforcement, resulting in more than 100 arrests and sparking protests by immigrant advocates.
Poet Williams, director of Durham Beyond Policing, a grassroots campaign to divest from policing and prisons, said he has grown tired of law enforcement killings.
“It sickens me in the deepest part of my spirit each and every time one of us becomes a new hashtag or headline,” Williams said. “Where does the cycle end?",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5194-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 21:57:46.646339

Nick Begich, R-Alaska, speaks during the commissioning ceremony for the Coast Guard icebreaker Storis on Sunday, Aug. 10, 2025, in Juneau, Alaska. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. House of Representatives voted 230-196 on Thursday to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years and reverse massive cost increases that went into effect with the new year.
The reversal must still be approved by the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump before becoming effective.
Alaska’s lone member of the House, Republican Rep. Nick Begich III, voted against the extension, as did 195 other Republicans.
Seventeen Republicans voted for the extension of subsidies that were enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, joining all of the chamber’s Democrats. 
The House’s Republican leaders opposed the extension, but a handful of Republicans signed a petition in December to force a vote.
Begich did not sign that petition, and on Wednesday, he joined other Republicans in an unsuccessful procedural vote intended to block Thursday’s decision.
In a written statement explaining his vote on Thursday, Begich said extending subsidies would not fix the problems he sees with the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  “The health insurance system created by Democrats under Obamacare has proven completely unaffordable for the American healthcare customer,” the statement said. “An extension of Obamacare COVID subsidies does not fix what is broken.”
He said he would like to see reforms to the Affordable Care Act, without which he said the extension “has no credible pathway forward in the Senate.”
In December, Begich voted in favor of a Republican-proposed alternative to the extension. That alternative, which focuses on drug costs, would not stop or reverse the new cost increases and has thus far been rejected by the Senate. 
The Congressional Budget Office reported that the alternative would reduce health insurance premiums for insured Americans but would also reduce the number of Americans who are insured. 
“I remain committed to working on reforms that lower costs, expand access, and improve outcomes for all Americans,” Begich said in his statement. “Temporary extensions without meaningful reform are not the solution. Real reform that puts patients first is.”
In December, Alaska’s two U.S. Senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — both Republicans — joined Senate Democrats in an unsuccessful attempt to advance a condition-free extension similar to the one passed by the House on Thursday.
That was a change in position for Sullivan, who had previously opposed extensions that were not coupled with changes to the Affordable Care Act.
Begich and Sullivan are each up for election this fall. Sullivan does not have a Democratic Party-backed opponent yet, but former U.S. House Rep. Mary Peltola is widely expected to enter the race this month.
Begich is being opposed by Anchorage pastor Matt Schultz. Alaska Democratic Party Chair Eric Croft said by email that Thursday’s vote will be a campaign issue in the fall.
“After allowing lifesaving ACA tax credits to expire on December 31, Nick Begich doubled down on his betrayal of Alaska families and blocked the extension of these credits,” he wrote. “We cannot afford these health care price hikes, and we won’t forget about Nick Begich’s betrayal this November.”

The vigil in Hartford was taking place on the west side of the Abraham Ribicoff Court House on Main Street after 6 p.m. when the disruption occurred at the back of the court house, along South Prospect Street.
It is unclear who provoked the confrontation, but witnesses saw two vehicles, a gray sedan and a white van, emerge from the garage. A number of people got in front of the gray sedan, under the impression that a detainee was being taken away, witnesses said. The sedan pushed through the group. One woman was knocked over by the vehicle.
“I had to, like, pick her up to prevent her from getting run over,” Arjun Patel told the CT Mirror. 
One witness said they were pepper-sprayed by a masked person who had been behind the vehicle.

A white van with New Hampshire license plates then drove out of the garage. A protester threw an object at the van, which broke the left-rear window. The van stopped, shifted into reverse and accelerated, scattering some protesters, then drove north on Prospect Street.
At least half a dozen people were pepper-sprayed during the confrontation.
Attempts to reach federal officials with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were unsuccessful.

Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday. 
A Hartford Police official said agents with either ICE or Federal Protective Services, a law enforcement agency within DHS, were driving the vehicles. The official said the person knocked down by the vehicle declined medical treatment.
No one was arrested, he said.

Sally Grossman came to the vigil Thursday night from Windsor, expecting it to be peaceful. When she heard shouts from the other side of the building from protesters calling for support, she ran to help. She was standing in front of one of the vehicles when she was pepper-sprayed, she said.
Grossman said she was shocked at how the night turned out. “I brought my 8-year-old daughter with me, and my mom. I’ve never been to a violent protest at all,” she said, while struggling to keep her eyes open. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”
The vigil continued on the west side of the courthouse, where leaders of numerous civil rights groups gave speeches. Several hundred people attended the vigil.
Dan Piper, a teacher who spoke at the vigil, told those gathered that the federal officials are hoping to silence dissent. 
“Their only hope is that the most unspeakable brutality that they commit will scare us into going home and being quiet,” he said. “Will we rise to the challenge? I believe we will. You have convinced me we will, as have many millions across this country.”

Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, was in the crowd and said that the death of Renee Good was terrifying and demonstrates the capacity of ICE to act violently. 
“I think something like this happening really calls for a clear decision from leaders. We are not where we’ve been,” she said.
Many of the event’s attendees were confused about — or ignorant of — what had occurred on the other side of the court house.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, attended the vigil and said he avoided the area where the confrontation happened with federal vehicles.
“I still don’t know a lot about what happened here tonight other than, obviously, there were some protesters who were looking to be more confrontational. But the vast majority of people here were looking to express their concerns peacefully,” he said. “I just don’t know yet what happened, and I don’t feel equipped to comment on it, but I hope everyone is safe.”

The move would concentrate more power over K-12 schools with the governor, who appoints the school board.","In summary
Newsom proposed shifting oversight of the Department of Education from the superintendent to the State Board of Education. The move would concentrate more power over K-12 schools with the governor, who appoints the school board. 


State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said he was blindsided by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal Thursday to curtail the superintendent’s duties and he disagrees with it, although it’s unclear what he can do to stop it.
“Tony Thurmond is proud and grateful to work with Gov. Newsom. They’re both champions of public education,” said Elizabeth Sanders, spokeswoman for the California Department of Education, which Thurmond heads. Sanders was speaking on behalf of the superintendent.
“Unfortunately, on this particular issue they are not aligned.”
In his State of the State address on Thursday, Newsom proposed shifting oversight of the Department of Education, a 2,000-employee state agency, from the superintendent to the State Board of Education. The move would concentrate more power over K-12 schools with the governor, who appoints the school board. 
The superintendent would remain an elected position, but with diminished and less defined duties. 
Referencing a December report from Policy Analysis for California Education, Newsom’s aim is to simplify California’s convoluted system of K-12 school governance. Currently, education leadership comes from the governor, the Legislature, the State Board of Education, the superintendent and the Department of Education — who may or may not have the same vision for how to best run schools and teach children. At the local level, school boards and county offices of education also have a good deal of power over budgets and day-to-day school operations.
The result of the many-headed leadership structure is that schools often don’t know which policies to follow, according to the PACE report. Guidelines can be contradictory, redundant or just plain incoherent, researchers found.
A slew of education advocacy groups have supported Newsom’s proposal, saying it will clarify a system that’s been confusing and inefficient for a century. California is one of only a handful of states with such an education governance model.
‘Unnecessary disruption’
Thurmond’s staff had a few hints that an announcement might be forthcoming, but otherwise was caught off guard by Newsom’s proposal, Sanders said. They also hadn’t talked to PACE researchers about their report.
Thurmond questions the point of the change, Sanders said.
“It’s unclear how this would benefit students and families,” Sanders said. “It’s an unnecessary disruption. … We should be staying focused on creating results for students.”
If the governor really wanted to help schools, he should pour more money into K-12 education. The Department of Education has been underfunded for years, she noted, and schools could use more funds for initiatives like tutoring and mandatory kindergarten.
John Affeldt, managing attorney at Public Advocates, a nonprofit law firm focused on education, also questioned the value of Newsom’s proposal. It would take power away from the voters and give it to the governor, which might be great if the governor supports public education but may backfire if a governor doesn’t, he said.
“It might improve the governance structure a bit, but I’m not sure it’s worth the tradeoff,” Affeldt said. “It might be a lot of political theater for not much real change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/100425_Gov-Candidate-Forum_ZM_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 20:57:13.205075

Less than 48 hours after the Montana Supreme Court stopped a first-of-its-kind constitutional measure that would prohibit corporations from spending money on political candidates or ballot issues, the Transparent Election Initiative in Montana resubmitted a revised proposal that its leaders said honored the court’s ruling and simplified the motion.
The organization also submitted a similar measure for a statutory initiative, which wasn’t originally part of what the group calls “The Montana Plan,” but will be done to ensure Montanans can vote on the concept in the November election.
A constitutional ballot initiative that receives a majority of votes would change the Montana Constitution while an initiative would modify state statute. Montana voters can propose and vote on laws except those which appropriate money, a power reserved only to the Legislature.
Transparent Election Initiative leader Jeff Mangan, who was formerly the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, said he still prefers the constitutional initiative because it would establish the concept in the highest law in the state. However, because the time for signature gathering is narrowing, the initiative process that would amend state law is also an alternative he wants to keep available, because the threshold is lower.
On Tuesday, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that the original proposal submitted by TEI violated a constitutional rule that limits a ballot initiative to a single-subject. A unanimous Supreme Court said that the measure contained several provisions that could be seen as reaching into more than just money in politics and corporate spending powers.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan on Thursday, after the newly reformulated documents were submitted to the Montana Secretary of State, that he took the court’s advice to heart and simplified the measure.
Previously, the initiative curtailed corporate spending in politics by revoking corporations’ powers granted by the state, then reinstating them, but excluding the power to spend on political campaigns.
Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, had successfully argued to the state’s highest court that the provision contained more than a single-subject — an argument with which the court agreed.
Now, the summary text of the measures makes clear that artificial persons and corporations do not have “political spending power.” Meanwhile, it says that political committees and “natural persons” can still spend money on politics. It also specifies that if a state-chartered business would spend politically, those corporations could lose limited liability status and be subject to punishment.
Mangan said this modification helps simplify the measure, clarifying that corporations cannot spend money on politics without risking losing the power to do business in Montana or fines.
Montana has been a historical leader in trying to curb the power of corporations and their ability to spend money in elections for more than a century. Lawmakers, voters and courts wrestled with the issue before the passage of the Corrupt Practices Act in 1912, which began a history of chasing corporate money from Treasure State politics. Montana’s efforts also were key in the controversial “Citizens United” ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said that corporations were artificial persons and entitled to spend money on political campaigns because that act is an expression of free speech and association. Montana argued that its law that stated corporations were not people, I-166, was legal and necessary given the state’s history — an argument that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected in a split decision.
The Transparent Election Initiative is taking a new, different tact: It’s targeting corporations through their charters. Because companies and corporations must be granted charters, or legal status by the state, they must comply with state laws regarding how business is conducted. This measure would limit those corporate rights to operate and bar political spending.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan that his previous attempt to craft ballot language may have been a case of wanting to “cross every T and dot every I” to ensure it was complete and would pass muster, but the effort may have been too complicated. Instead, the new proposals simplify and condense the aims, he said.
The organization also submitted a statutory initiative along with the constitutional issue to the state. He said that’s because of the time it will likely take for the review process at the Secretary of State’s Office as well as a required review at the Montana Attorney General’s Office. Those processes, and any legal challenges that follow, will continue to shorten the window for signature collecting. Both initiative and constitutional ballot would need to have enough signatures submitted to the state by June 19 in order to make the November election.
For constitutional ballots, Montana requires “the petition must be signed by at least 10%  of the qualified electors in the state at large, including at 10% in each of at least two-fifths (40) of the legislative districts,” according to Montana law.
For statutory initiatives, Montana requires a lower threshold: “At least 5% of the qualified electors in each of at least one-third of the legislative representative districts (34)  and the total number of signers must be at least 5% of the total qualified electors of the state.”
“Everywhere I go around the state, people just want their elections back,” Mangan said. “Montanans deserve a fair shot at voting on whether corporations should be allowed to dominate our political process. Today’s filings provide a pathway.”

Federal agents reportedly shot and injured two people in east Portland on Thursday afternoon, according to the Portland Police Bureau.
Police had few immediate details to share about the incident, which occurred the day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis.
Like Minneapolis, Oregon’s largest city has been the subject of an intense immigration crackdown by federal agents in recent months. While a federal judge stymied President Donald Trump’s efforts to mobilize the Oregon National Guard and deploy guardsmen from other states to Portland, federal officials revealed in court in December that they’ve brought ICE agents from around the country to the metro as part of a major operation.
“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” Portland Police Chief Bob Day said in a statement. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”
Police received reports of a shooting on the 10200 block of Southeast Main Street at 2:18 p.m. Six minutes later, they received a call for help from a man at Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside, a few blocks away.
They found a man and woman with apparent gunshot wounds. Emergency responders transported both people to the hospital and their condition is unknown, according to police.
Portland Mayor Keith Wilson called on ICE to immediately pause its operations in Portland and urged residents to remain calm.
“We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts. Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences,” Wilson said. “As mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.”
U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, also urged her constituents to stay calm and said local law enforcement must be able to conduct a full investigation.
“ICE has done nothing but inject terror, chaos, and cruelty into our communities,” Dexter said. “Trump’s immigration machine is using violence to control our communities—straight out of the authoritarian playbook. ICE must immediately end all active operations in Portland.”
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, added that he was monitoring reports, and that “Trump’s deployment of federal agents in my hometown is clearly inflaming violence — and must end.”

Nevada originally won early approval for the state’s internet deployment plan in January 2025 through the Biden administration, but by June the Trump administration rescinded approval of Nevada’s plan, along with plans from Louisiana and Delaware, which had also received early approval.
The Trump administration issued new guidance for spending the federal funding, ordering states to focus more on satellite providers and less on fiber optics, and to spend less overall.
Nevada filed its final Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) proposal to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in September last year, which has now been approved according to the governor’s office. 
“A commitment was made to connect every Nevadan to reliable, high-speed internet, and it remains one of my top priorities. With this final approval from the NTIA, I am proud to announce that we are delivering on that promise,” said Gov. Joe Lombardo in a statement.
The approval will unlock more than $170 million of Nevada’s $416 million total BEAD allocation for projects across the state as part of the High-Speed Nevada Initiative’s third phase. Deployment of BEAD projects is expected to begin in mid-2026 with construction of various projects happening over the next four years. 
The High-Speed Nevada Initiative will connect reliable high-speed internet to underserved rural communities throughout the state using a mix of technologies, including fiber-optic, hybrid-fiber-coax, licensed fixed wireless, and satellite broadband, said the governor’s office.
The Governor’s Office of Science, Innovation and Technology (OSIT), said they also plan to leverage more than $65 million in private sector investments as part of the BEAD deployment. 
“I am proud of the work our team has done, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring affordable, reliable high-speed internet is accessible to all Nevadans, regardless of where they live. With NTIA approval of Nevada’s BEAD proposal, we are now one step closer to deployment and realizing our goals,” d Britta Appel, Director of OSIT.

Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, announces his 2026 campaign for governor during an event on June 30, 2025, at the David Lust Accelerator Building in Rapid City. (Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Republican governor candidate Dusty Johnson wants to give first-time homebuyers two years without property taxes and also wants to provide $400 annual property tax credits to all other homeowners in the state, he announced Thursday.
“Property taxes have become a problem for every South Dakota homeowner, and I feel duty-bound to provide relief to all of them,” Johnson said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight.
Johnson is serving the remainder of his term in the U.S. House while he seeks the Republican nomination for governor in June’s primary election. His proposal comes as lawmakers prepare to debate a heap of other property tax ideas during the legislative session that begins Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Homeowners’ property tax payments rose nearly 40% from 2020 to 2024, causing many to demand relief.

Johnson would pay for his proposal with $110 million in estimated annual revenue that will be available when the state sales tax rate goes back to 4.5%. Lawmakers reduced it to 4.2% in 2023 but scheduled the reduction to sunset after June 30, 2027.
“It’s important that the relief is fiscally responsible,” Johnson said. “There are a lot of plans out there. There are a lot of people promising the moon, but they can’t actually make the math work.”
Johnson said each homeowner would see the credit on their county property tax statement.
Johnson’s campaign said there are about 260,000 homeowner-occupied parcels in South Dakota, making a $400 credit for each come to about $104 million. The campaign said there are about 1,500 first-time homeowners every year who pay an average of $2,000 in property taxes, which comes to $3 million annually, or $6 million for the first two years.
Among the other property tax relief ideas that could be considered by lawmakers this winter are 19 proposed by a task force over the summer.
Hansen: Johnson tries to ‘take credit for others’ plans’
State House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, served on the task force and is seeking the Republican nomination for governor. He accused Johnson of stealing the sales tax idea from the task force.
One of the task force recommendations, from Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, would capture the revenue from the scheduled sales tax increase and place it in a “local effort replacement fund” to replace a portion of property taxes paid to school districts. The recommendation does not specify a plan for $400 credits or a two-year property tax holiday for first-time homebuyers.
Hansen also pointed to a social media post of his from Nov. 3 when he proposed the “preservation of $105 million in sales tax relief dedicated to property tax cuts.”
“Dusty Johnson can try to take credit for others’ plans all day, but the reality is he didn’t do the work to create this plan,” Hansen said in a statement. “This proposal was adopted by the property tax task force this summer, which I created and helped lead. Over two months ago I announced this proposal as just one aspect of a larger plan to significantly reduce property taxes. A vote on this plan is already coming this legislative session.”

Hansen has also endorsed taking money from a state housing infrastructure fund and state reserve funds to provide $120 million of property tax relief to homeowners through $500 credits; cutting state spending by 5% and using the $123 million of savings for property tax cuts; and dedicating 25% of future state revenue growth to property tax relief.
Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, said Johnson’s plan “does nothing to actually confront the problems negatively impacting South Dakota.”
“Shifting from one tax to another doesn’t alleviate the burden on residents. It makes it worse,” Doeden said. “The state should be seeking to lower the tax burden on South Dakota families, not create an increase.”
Doeden has pledged to eliminate property taxes by utilizing savings from the creation of a state Department of Government Efficiency, by implementing “more fair and equitable” ways to generate revenue, and by growing the economy to widen the tax base.
Gov. Rhoden supports optional county sales tax
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden is serving the remainder of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s term after she departed to serve in the Trump Cabinet. Rhoden is also running to keep his job, and has already signed one property tax relief proposal into law after legislators approved it in March.
The multifaceted law, which took effect in July, is intended to slow property tax increases. It places tighter limits on the growth of property assessments and local government budgets for five years, exempts some home improvements from affecting assessments, and makes more elderly and disabled people eligible for property tax assessment freezes by raising limits on their income and home values.
Governor: ‘Not much I’ve seen that I could support’ in legislative property tax proposals

Rhoden has additionally proposed an optional half-percent sales tax for counties, which they could use to reduce the county portion of owner-occupied property taxes on homes. Counties are not currently allowed to levy sales taxes.
Rhoden said Thursday in a statement that “South Dakotans deserve a meaningful property tax cut, and my plan delivers it.”
“A blanket statewide sales tax increase delivers less relief for the South Dakota communities who need it most,” Rhoden said. “My plan empowers voters in each county to make their own decisions, and to deliver a bigger property tax cut for homeowners if they choose.”
County commissioners could impose Rhoden’s proposed county sales tax, and citizens could gather petition signatures to send the decision to local voters.
Johnson said Rhoden’s plan “passes the buck” to county commissions. He also said it could transfer tax benefits from rural counties to urban counties, pointing to greater taxable sales in larger cities.
South Dakota Searchlight asked Johnson to square his property tax proposal with his earlier pledge to make schools the state’s top budget priority. He said long-term school funding depends on economic growth, and lower homeownership costs would help achieve that goal.
Johnson said homeowners who already qualify for state relief programs, such as elderly and disabled people, would still get the $400 credit.

Brad Little to navigate revenue shortfalls and pass a balanced budget.

Setting a revenue projection is an important step in the annual budget setting process legislators undertake because the Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a deficit where expenses exceed revenues. Without a revenue projection, legislators don’t have a clear estimate of how much money the state can afford to spend while setting state agency budgets.
“We’re going to try to tackle the revenue projection right away,” Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, said Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
 Last year, legislators waited to set revenue projection until late in the session

But last year, legislators did not set an official revenue projection to base the state budget around until March 5, which was 59 days into the legislative session. By that point, legislators had already passed major tax cuts and set major budgets before they set the revenue projection – a move that was criticized by some members of both political parties. 
But Anthon – the top ranking Republican in the Idaho Senate – said legislative leaders don’t want to wait that long during the 2026 Idaho legislative session, which begins Monday. 
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”
Balancing and setting the state budget is likely to be one of the top issues during the 2026 legislative session. 
For years, Idaho has enjoyed consecutive budget surpluses as high as $2 billion.
But after five years of the Idaho Legislature passing income tax cuts that reduced state revenue by up to $4 billion, Idaho is facing projected budget deficits in the current fiscal year 2026 and next year in fiscal year 2027.
The latest projection for the current year projects a state budget deficit of $40.3 million. 
For fiscal year 2027, one state estimate projected a state budget deficit of $555.2 million. 
Those projections do not include the added cost of complying with federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would reduce state revenue even further if adopted at the state level.
During a press conference with reporters on Thursday, Little offered a preview of the annual State of the State address, which he will deliver Monday during the first day of the 2026 legislative session. 
Little told reporters he will propose a balanced state budget, and he has committed to Trump that Idaho will conform with the tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act – changes that include no tax on overtime pay or tips for workers, an expanded deduction for seniors and no tax on borrowers’ car loan interest. 
“There is one new pledge I’ll give you right now – we are going to propose a balanced budget,” Little said. 
“I did commit to the president when I met with him that we were going to implement compliance (with the Big Beautiful Bill’s tax changes), and so that’s kind of where I’m coming from,” Little added.
 Idaho governor says he is not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion

While House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said earlier this week he is open to the idea of repealing Medicaid expansion as a tool to reduce state spending, Little told reporters Thursday that he is not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion.
Little cautioned against repealing Medicaid expansion, which more than 60% of Idaho voters approved in the 2018 general election. Little said there would be unintended consequences to repealing Medicaid expansion and said the state took away some of the safety nets that had been in place prior to Medicaid expansion, including the Catastrophic Health Care Fund, or CAT Fund, that provided care for indigent patients with no other health coverage.

“If you look at Medicaid, there’s all kinds of unintended consequences,” Little said. “The raw number for repeal is not the actual number, and the Department of Health Welfare is working on that.”
When asked, Little stopped short of saying he would veto a bill seeking to repeal Medicaid expansion. Instead, Little said he doesn’t comment on what he will do with bills before they arrive on his desk. 
While Little said he was not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said she is still deeply concerned about the impact of the budget cuts Idaho legislators will make to balance the budget. 
“We are in a hole,” Rubel said. “There’s no question about it. We are $555 million below what we need to cover the most basic maintenance budgets to keep the lights on in our agencies.”
Rubel said Idaho has a self-inflicted revenue problem, not a spending problem. Rubel urged Little and the Idaho Legislature to balance the budget by increasing revenue through repealing last year’s income tax cuts and the passage of the new education tax credit, which reimburses families for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
“We don’t have a spending problem,” Rubel said. “There is no fat to cut. In fact, we already fund things at such an incredibly low level that it’s costly in and of itself.”
On Thursday, Little did not reveal any of the specific budget initiatives or cost-cutting measures he will recommend to the Idaho Legislature. Instead Little asked Idahoans to wait for Monday’s State of the State address, when he said he will unveil his proposals. 
Little is scheduled to deliver the address to the Idaho Legislature at 1 p.m. Mountain time Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. The address will be streamed live online, for free, via the Idaho in Session service.

Palestinians have the right to exist, return, thrive and live with full human dignity.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Stevie Paquette: When ethics are questioned, Vermonters deserve answers — not sponsored narratives.","This commentary is by Stevie Paquette, a Colchester resident pursuing a master’s degree in social work, with an interest in ethics, human rights and Palestinian self-determination. 



I am writing this as a Vermonter, a constituent and someone who is openly anti-Zionist and believes in the legitimacy and self-determination of the Palestinian people. I also believe deeply in ethical, transparent government and public accountability. 
When a number of local lawmakers traveled to Israel on an all-expenses-paid trip arranged by foreign political organizations — not to mention an organization that has been accused by the UN of actively committing genocide — I reached out to my representatives with what I thought were reasonable questions. I didn’t demand outrage or resignations. I asked for some transparency. 
Who paid for this trip? Who determined what our elected officials would see? And not see? What political organization curated this experience? Whose perspectives were intentionally excluded in this trip?
I emailed five representatives. One responded. The reply from Rep. Sarita Austin, D-Colchester, was polite, but it largely shifted the conversation away from ethics and toward reminders about Hamas, personal reflections, a ChatGPT-generated history timeline and talking points about coexistence. My main concern — whether our lawmakers should be accepting foreign sponsored political travel at all — went unaddressed. 
Meanwhile, these legislators have continued either to publicly defend the trip or completely ignore calls for answers, acting as if this questioning is somehow out of bounds. 
With renewed reporting and formal ethics complaints now filed, I am reminded that these questions are not extreme. They were necessary. 
This is not about choosing sides in a geopolitical conflict with deep historical roots. It is entirely possible, and I believe morally necessary, to condemn the violence of Hamas, acknowledge the grief and fear experienced by Israelis and still question whether elected officials should travel on trips curated and funded by organizations aligned with a government accused of serious, ongoing human rights violations. 
Those things are not mutually exclusive. 
The concern is about influence, not tourism. 
Sponsored political trips exist because they work. They are designed to create warm positive impressions, establish relationships and loyalty and to take control and frame reality through their own lens. They shape what is seen as “normal” or “inevitable” or “reasonable.” 
When lawmakers accept those invitations, it creates at minimum the appearance of undue influence and at worst risks normalizing and spreading propaganda. 
It also sends a stark and painful message to Vermonters, especially Palestinian Vermonters and those who stand with them, that our government is comfortable participating in experiences curated by the very institutions accused of their oppression. 
To raise these concerns is not antisemitic. It is not anti-Jewish. It is not even anti-Israel. It is simply ethical citizenship. 
And, honestly, transparency should not be this controversial. 
At a minimum, Vermonters should be able to expect full disclosure of who is funding travel, public itineraries, identification of the organizations arranging the meetings and clarity about the political aims of the trip’s sponsors. 
These are basic standards, in many states required, and Vermont should be stronger, not weaker, on ethics. 
When I wrote my representatives, I was not asking them to agree with my politics. I was asking them to model accountability. Instead, I received deflection and silence. 
We deserve better. 
I am anti-Zionist because I believe oppression cannot be justified by fear, history or identity. Palestinians have the right to exist, return, thrive and live with full human dignity. That doesn’t make me naïve, dangerous or unreasonable. It’s pretty simple to place human rights over nationalism. And that principle should be guiding our legislators’ ethics. 
Lawmakers should not be accepting curated, paid-for political travel from any foreign government or advocacy network, regardless of ideology. Not from Israel. Not from anyone. 
If legislators believe such trips are appropriate, then they should be willing and ready to answer, plainly, why and be transparent on details. 
Until then, Vermonters will continue to raise these questions. And we should.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)A top adviser to Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson is back at work with a new title and portfolio.
Sahar Fathi, Ferguson’s policy director when she went on a six-month leave July 1, is returning to a newly created post of chief impact officer. Fathi will report directly to Ferguson and remain a member of his executive leadership team. She had reported to the chief of staff.
Fathi’s focus will be on developing “progressive policy solutions” and she will serve as the primary contact with community organizations and local government leaders. She will also supervise the federal policy team, according to the governor’s office.
“This new role will allow Sahar to focus on progressive, proactive policy work, in direct partnership with community and elected leaders,” Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.
Kenneth Martin, interim policy director during Fathi’s absence, will succeed her in that post.
“I believe policy is a powerful tool in the governor’s mission to make government center the people,” Fathi said in a statement issued by the governor’s office. “That means all the people — especially those who have historically been left behind, and those targeted by the Trump administration. Creating a leadership position explicitly focused on this goal is exactly the kind of innovation that makes me excited to be part of his administration.”
Fathi served as Ferguson’s policy director when he was the state’s attorney general. She was one of the first people he hired after getting elected governor in November 2024. 
As policy director, she oversaw a 20-person staff responsible for developing policy initiatives in support of Ferguson’s agenda.
Her lengthy resume of public service includes working for King County, the Seattle Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs and as a legislative aide to former Seattle City Council member Mike O’Brien, according to online biographies. In 2013, Fathi made The Stranger’s list of The Smartest People in Seattle Politics. 
Martin served as deputy policy director for issues related to the environment, transportation and infrastructure until filling in for Fathi. He led the American Indian Environmental Office in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden and served as deputy assistant secretary for tribal government affairs in the U.S. Department of Transportation under President Barack Obama.
Ferguson’s communications office declined to share Fathi’s salary for the newly created position. She earned $195,000 a year as policy director, according to public records obtained by The Standard. The governor’s office also did not share Martin’s salary.
With Thursday’s announcements, Ferguson will have new leaders in place for his legislative and policy shops when lawmakers return for the 2026 session that begins Monday.
In May, Ferguson named Debbie Driver as legislative director. She served as a transportation policy advisor to former Gov. Jay Inslee and also worked as an analyst with the state House of Representatives. 
She replaced Joyce Bruce, who resigned in March, not long after her deputy, Shawn Lewis, had quit. That left the governor without a legislative team in the final stretch of his first legislative session.
At the time, the governor’s policy team absorbed the legislative work and Fathi served as the primary contact for legislative leadership.
Ferguson cited the added chores when Fathi, whom he said had been “a crucial member” of his team since 2019, took leave.
“After six years and a particularly intense legislative session, in which she took on more than one full-time job, she’s taking a break,” he said.
Meanwhile, Ferguson will be losing a member of his cabinet this month as Joe Nguyen is leaving as director of Washington state’s Department of Commerce to become the new leader of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber. 
Ferguson has not announced who will fill that spot.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/governors-office-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 19:12:29.541653

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)A Henderson man who threw his girlfriend’s three month-old kitten against a wall and then into a parking lot and sent the video to her in an alleged attempt to intimidate her, must stay away from his girlfriend, guns, and “any animals, whatsoever” as his case proceeds, Henderson Justice of the Peace Barbara Schifalacqua ordered Thursday. 
“The court has real concern because of not only the threats made but the video sent in this matter,” Schifalacqua said to Angel Ventura Ayala, who appeared for the hearing via Zoom. Ayala posted bail shortly after his arrest Dec. 16. 
Court records indicate Ayala is charged with one felony count of domestic violence abuse with a deadly weapon and two felony counts of animal abuse with the intent to threaten or terrorize an individual. Reba’s Law, passed last year by the Nevada Legislature, increases the penalty for animal abuse that is intended to threaten or intimidate. 
 An incident report filed by Henderson Police says Ayala, 27, was mad at his girlfriend, 19 year-old Sienna Aldabbagh, and sent her a video of himself throwing the cat. 
Ayala, according to the incident report, can be heard on the video saying “‘you got this, right’ as he is picking up the cat as though he was making sure that the subject was recording. He then says ‘I’ll throw your bitch ass cat’… As Angel walked down the breezeway, he violently threw Suki (the kitten) against the wall toward the parking lot. Angel then picked up the cat a second time and threw it into the parking lot. The cat could be heard crying during the second throw.”
The report states that while Aldabbagh was searching for the kitten near Ayala’s apartment, “Angel pulled a gun from his waistband, racked a round and threatened her with it.” 
The video on social media quickly drew the attention of animal advocates. 
“The links between domestic violence and animal abuse are well-documented and apparent in this case,” Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals, one of several activists who notified police of the allegation, said Thursday. “We’re having a rash of animal cruelty cases, and we are among the worst states in the nation for domestic violence.”  
The cat, which was treated by a veterinarian for minor injuries, was turned over to Henderson Animal Shelter, according to the police report. It’s unknown whether the cat has been retrieved from the shelter. 
Ayala’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 11. His attorney had no comment on the case.
The case is among the first to test Reba’s Law, passed by lawmakers last year after homeless individuals discovered a French bulldog abandoned in a sealed plastic tote in the summer heat behind a commercial building in 2024. The dog died days later. 
Following the arrest of suspects in Reba’s death, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he’d been besieged by citizens calling for stiffer penalties for animal abuse. However, the Current’s review of cases prosecuted by Wolfson revealed the DA rarely sought to impose prison time for offenders. 
Days after Gov. Joe Lombardo signed Reba’s Law, Wolfson cut a plea deal with one of the defendants charged in Reba’s case. 
“O.K. Wolfson, you asked for a new law. Now you’ve got it. What are you going to do with it?” Greisen asked rhetorically. 
The new law increases willful animal abuse or neglect that results in death from a category D felony, punishable by up to four years in prison, to a category B felony, punishable by a minimum of one year and up to six years in prison. It also renders animal abuse or neglect that is intended to threaten, intimidate, or terrorize an individual as a category B felony, also punishable by up to six years behind bars. 
“Is this going to be another case of our weak and ineffective judicial system telling the perpetrator to ‘never do this again,’ receive some sort of probation and/or pay an insignificant fine?” Boulder City resident Fred Voltz said via email of the case involving the cat. “These cases will continue to occur unless the same significant penalties for assault and battery apply to any animal as it would to any human adult or child.”
Animal activists say they are also frustrated by what they call a lack of awareness by law enforcement regarding the provisions of Reba’s Law. 
At a community gathering Tuesday in Summerlin, organized by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police to educate the public about the provisions of Reba’s Law, Det. Nancy Leyva, one of two detectives assigned to animal abuse and neglect cases, stated the law increased the penalty for abuse or neglect resulting in death to 10 years, and said an individual who fails to take action to prevent the malicious act is subject to the same penalty. 
However, both provisions – the 10 year maximum penalty and the effort to hold accountable an individual who fails to act – were removed from the bill following concerns voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union and others. 
Leyva referred the Current to Metro’s public information office, which did not respond.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image-1-8-26-at-4.01 PM-1024x627.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:12:29.541653

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)A plan to expand New Jersey’s corporate tax breaks by billions and grant Newark’s Prudential Center new tax subsidies cleared another hurdle Thursday on its gallop to the governor’s desk.
The Senate’s budget and appropriations committee unanimously approved a bill that still needs to pass both full chambers by Tuesday, when the current two-year legislative session ends, to become law.
The bill advanced despite objections from critics who said raising the state’s current cap on corporate tax credits from $11.5 billion to $14.3 billion, as the bill proposes, is “reckless” during a time of worsening budget constraints.
Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst with New Jersey Policy Perspective, predicted people and community groups around the state would be stiffed in favor of “billionaire sports owners.”
“They are going to be told: ‘Sorry, there’s no money. Sorry, we only have this much for you this year.’ But now, when it comes to raise the cap on corporate subsidies, suddenly checkbooks open, right? Suddenly, it’s: ‘OK, let’s raise the $3 billion’ in the blink of an eye,” Chen said.
Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, urged lawmakers to direct the state Economic Development Authority to show evidence of any benefits such subsidies have generated for the state in the past five years before doling out more.
But Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), a committee member and the bill’s prime sponsor, bristled at the criticism and called the bill necessary for Newark, which is in her legislative district.

“People throughout this state have tropes and stereotypes about the district that I represent. When they come down to the Pru Center for a hockey game or for a mega concert or for some other kind of venue, perhaps in those four hours that they’re down there, they realize the greatness of our great city,” Ruiz said.
Jake Reynolds, who’s president of both the center and the New Jersey Devils, who play there, told lawmakers the facility needs $400 million in repairs and renovations, and the new subsidies would help fund them.

Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) looks on. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Baltimore area officials still want to create some kind of regional body to oversee the area’s water system — just don’t call it a regional water authority.
During the introductory meeting Wednesday of a new work group discussing the matter, Baltimore Comptroller Bill Henry (D), the work group’s chairman, said that a regional water authority is officially off the table.
“That path has since proved prohibitive from several financial and legal perspectives,” Henry said. “Instead, our focus here over the course of the next year will be much more practical, and — hopefully — more achievable.”
During a previous task force convened to discuss the water system — which is largely owned by Baltimore City but serves Baltimore County and other neighboring jurisdictions — officials looked closely at a water authority.
But they discovered several problems that would arise from creating a new, regional entity to handle day-to-day operations for the system, as opposed to Baltimore’s Department of Public Works, which largely runs the system today.
For one thing, the existing debt incurred by the city to run the system would have to be transferred to that new entity, and because much of that debt was incurred when interest rates were substantially lower, doing so would come at an immense cost.

Creating a new entity would also impact employees, who would essentially transfer to a new employer, even if their jobs remained the same. And it would force pension obligations to be relocated as well.
So, Henry says he envisions a new governance structure whereby the city agency would still handle the operations of the system, but it would ultimately answer to a board of officials from around the region, instead of simply Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D).
“Right now, DPW just works for the mayor of Baltimore, right? And the director of DPW does what the mayor says,” Henry said in an interview. “What is on the table to change is: The director would do what this regional entity says they should do.”
It remains to be seen precisely what form the new body could take. The new work group is specifically tasked with evaluating whether a “Rate Board,” tasked only with setting utility bills for water, sewer and stormwater, would be a good fit for the region. Currently, much of that power sits with Baltimore’s Board of Estimates.
There is also likely to be significant political grappling over how such a board might be composed, and how many representatives would come from the city, versus the surrounding counties or other entities.
Per a recently released schedule, the new work group plans to release its final report by the end of this year.
The 13-member Baltimore Regional Water Governance Model Work Group is the second cohort to consider Baltimore’s water system over the past several years. Under a 2024 state law, Scott selects five of the 13 members, with three appointed by the Baltimore County executive, two by the governor, one each by the Maryland Senate president and House speaker, and one from Anne Arundel, Carroll, Harford or Howard counties.
The work group’s decision could cap years of tension between city and county about the control of the water system. Infrastructure woes and billing issues have stirred the pot in recent years, but demographic change also lies at the heart of the matter.
The system was constructed by a far larger Baltimore City, which agreed to expand it outward to service Baltimore County as that jurisdiction grew, and to serve other counties, though to a lesser extent. Today, the size of the county far surpasses that of the city, but the city maintains much of the control.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Environmental and ratepayer advocacy groups have previously expressed concern that, even though the city and counties have cost-sharing agreements, city residents bear too much of the cost, and expressed worry that a regional water authority could seize assets from the city, leaving it worse off financially.
So Jorge Aguilar, southern region director at Food and Water Watch, said he was heartened to learn Wednesday that a regional water authority wasn’t in the cards for Baltimore.
“Based on those findings for the first task force on this issue, it was estimated that the creation of the new authority could result in more than $2 billion in transaction costs and could lead to large water bill hikes, water shut offs, privatization, loss of potential unionized positions within the city and within the county government. So again, really glad that is off the table,” Aguilar said.
“We really do hope that the outcome of your deliberations will be to ensure more equity in the cost allocations between the city and the county, while protecting and expanding local control, union jobs and water affordability,” Aguilar said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC09916-1024x622.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) introduced three medical compact bills ahead of the legislative session, saying the state’s healthcare worker shortage requires the Legislature to enter more than just compacts for doctors and social workers. (Courtesy NM Legislature) After weeks of bipartisan negotiations, state lawmakers this week unveiled legislation intended to make it easier for doctors to practice in New Mexico by entering a multistate medical compact for physicians.
Advocates have lobbied for years that entering the compact — which would allow doctors licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico — will help address the state’s physician shortage, but have faced pushback from some Democratic lawmakers. 
Now one lawmaker from the working group on the issue, Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque), said the proposals intended for this session don’t go far enough.
This week, she introduced three bills that would enter the state into three additional health care compacts and is urging her colleagues to at least consider them.
New Mexico Senate majority leader says medical compact legislation ‘close’ ahead of session

“Our health system is in really bad shape right now,” she told Source NM. “I can’t think of a higher priority for us in the coming session but to address solutions to the problem, and compacts are a part of that.” 
Unlike 44 jurisdictions, including New Mexico’s five border states, New Mexico is neither a member of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact for physicians, nor part of eight other major compacts for paramedics, audiologists, dentists and other specialties, according to Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan advocacy group. 
In response to ongoing pressure from advocates and state Republican lawmakers to allow medical compact legislation a full hearing at the Roundhouse, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) in November convened a six-lawmaker working group composed of Democrats and Republicans in both chambers. 
Members were tasked with crafting legislation that would enter the state into health care licensure compacts amid public outcry over growing wait lists and long drives to access health care across the state. The state lost close to 250 doctors between 2019 and 2024.
Wirth told Source New Mexico that the group, after multiple meetings, succeeded in crafting licensure compact legislation for doctors and social workers, but that other potential compacts need more work and remain “in the pipeline.” Lawmakers are expected to introduce the social worker compact legislation soon.
Wirth has previously described joining compacts as a complex process that requires lawmakers to work closely with managers of each of the licensure organizations individually to ensure legislation meets their requirements but also ensures the state maintains its autonomy. 
But Matthews said she emerged from the working group convinced that joining the compacts is relatively easy and that reconciling the state’s legislation with compact requirements is often a matter of “stylistic” versus “substantive” changes. 
She also is increasingly persuaded the compacts work. She provided Source a list of studies that show immediate increases in health care workers for states that join compacts.
NM Senate Dems unlikely to move on medical compacts for special session

Matthews said she faced pushback in the working group about introducing additional compact bills, but decided, “We need to move forward on this.”
Her legislation would enter New Mexico into compacts for paramedics, counselors and psychologists. 
She told Source she is actively working with managers for each of those compacts, sharing the legislation and seeking assurances that the language meets their requirements. She expects to amend each bill soon after the session starts with any additional notes they provide, she told Source.
Still, Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), one of the sponsors for the physician compact bill, told Source this week that she doesn’t think the Legislature will have enough time to carefully consider each of Matthews’ compacts.
As evidence, she pointed to the amount of work the doctor compact took, saying the lawmakers and compact managers had to toil over language about, for example, liability for compact board members; the state Medical Board’s subpoena power; and protection of health records, particularly for women and transgender people. Doing that for three other compacts during a 30-day session would be impossible, she said. 
“They’re not ready,” she said of Matthews’ compacts. “We have not had any comprehensive meetings with the organizations on that to make sure that any changes that we make will be accepted.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/matthewsroundhouse-1024x512.png,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

“Our wealth divide has done nothing but grown,” said Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, who expressed particular concern at some corporate taxes loosening.

That’s what Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, wants the Vermont tax system to be, she said Thursday morning. But following the passage of federal tax law changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, she said, that lofty goal may have become harder to ensure. And she worries the changes could threaten the state’s tax revenue, too.
The House Committee on Ways and Means, which Kornheiser chairs, has lost no time this week diving into the weeds of new federal tax law as it weighs what state-level changes might be necessary or feasible. In lieu of regaling each other with news from the summer, Kornheiser asked lawmakers to name their favorite thing about working on tax policy while introducing themselves on Tuesday.  
“This year marks the 50th year I’ve been married to a CPA,” offered Rep. Carolyn Branagan, R-Georgia.
A number of the federal changes, particularly to corporate taxes, will flow through to Vermont’s tax calculation processes. Like many other states, Vermont uses parts of the federal tax system as a baseline for levying its own fees on taxpayers. 
Patrick Titterton, an analyst in the state’s Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, told the committee Tuesday that changes to tax policy in the new federal budget are complex, with some likely to decrease revenue and some expected to increase it. In summary, small $1.3 million and $4.9 million decreases are projected in each of the next two fiscal years, Titterton said, while other impacts will be less immediate as some new measures take effect over the course of up to 10 years.
Corporate income tax, a notably fickle revenue source, Titterton said Thursday, is projected to provide roughly 10% of Vermont’s General Fund revenue in the 2026 fiscal year.
State lawmakers have decided before that federal tax changes are not in Vermont’s interest. In a 2018 special session, lawmakers “uncoupled” Vermont’s tax code from certain federal provisions around personal income tax. For now, Kornheiser said the state remains much more bound to Washington, D.C., when it comes to corporate taxes.
For Kornheiser, it’s potentially an equity issue.
“Our wealth divide has done nothing but grown,” she said. “The Trump administration’s tax work just did even more to exacerbate that.”

In the know
Flanked by a real who’s-who of health care advocates today, State Treasurer Mike Pieciak held a press conference championing H.577, a bill that his office has steered that aims to bring down the price of prescription drugs.
The bill, sponsored by House Health Care Committee chair Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex Town, and Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, proposes Vermont join a coalition of states — Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada and Connecticut — to pool drug purchasing power, negotiate lower costs and secure bulk discounts. Joining the group would come at no cost to the state, but the bill would allocate $50,000 for the Treasurer’s Office to develop and promote the program.
If the state were to join, anyone in Vermont could receive a free drug discount card and use it instead of insurance when buying a medication. Pieciak said he especially hopes this helps those whose prescriptions may not be covered by Medicare, individuals who have dropped their commercial insurance or those who opted for a less-comprehensive plan. 
Still to come as the bill works its way through the House Health Care Committee: more discussion on whether paying out-of-pocket can count toward one’s deductible.

On the move
The Senate voted to send a bill that would require disclosures on certain AI-generated media back to its Government Operations Committee on Thursday. The committee will review the changes the House made to the bill, S.23, before that chamber passed the measure last year. The Senate never took up the House’s changes before adjourning for 2025. 
Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, the gov ops chair, said in an interview his committee would take testimony on the House’s revisions next week. He said he did not expect the changes would be controversial and that the bill would likely make it back to the floor.
Both the House and Senate versions of S.23 would require certain publishers of images created using AI — and that depict political candidates — to also attach a message stating that the content is fake. The disclosure requirement would apply to these “deepfakes,” as they’re often called, only when they are published within 90 days of an election.

Too hot to handle
Statehouse regulars who opt to bring their own lunch have probably noticed a change in the building this week — there is no longer a microwave available for public use in the cafeteria. Safe to say, the appliance’s sudden disappearance has been a cause of consternation, if not at least several cold meals of leftover takeout.
Sitting in its place is a rather ominous sign from the Sergeant-at-Arms’ Office:
“The microwave in this location was destroyed,” it reads. “At this time, there are no plans to replace the microwave due to continued maintenance and fire-related issues. Thank you.”
Turns out, “fire-related issues” is a polite way of saying that food-reheaters have been responsible for two of the three total fires in the Statehouse over the past year, Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler said Thursday. The latter of those two conflagrations, she said, caused the appliance’s untimely demise.
Kessler said the fires had taken up a significant amount of emergency responders’ time and resources, which for her outweighed the benefits of keeping the microwave in use. She noted, too, that there are other microwaves located around the building that people can use.
The extent to which those other microwaves are publicly accessible is, sort of, a matter of perspective. It is The People’s House, after all. My advice: Use the one a short walk from the cafeteria in the alcove past the House Commerce and House Corrections rooms.
But maybe follow the advice on the appliance’s door: Use a lid!

Pennie enrollment drops as Congress wrestles with health insurance subsidy vote,Whitney Downard,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/pa-pennie-enrollment-drops-as-congress-wrestles-with-health-insurance-subsidy-vote/,"So far, an estimated 70,000 Pennsylvanians have ended their coverage, with between 465,000 and 472,000 enrolled as of this week.","A Pennie sign seen at the 2026 Pennsylvania Farm Show on Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Thousands of Pennsylvanians have left the state’s only Affordable Care Act marketplace, Pennie, following sharp increases in monthly premiums due to expiring enhanced federal subsidies. 
Pennie numbers continue to fluctuate as the U.S. House voted Thursday to extend benefits for moderate-income enrollees for three more years. The measure moves to the Senate and, if approved, would need to be signed by President Donald Trump before the subsidies take effect. At least 70,000 Pennsylvania residents have left the exchange so far. 
For those still enrolled, rising costs means cutting expenses elsewhere. 
Andrew Gehman, who lives in Franklin County, told the Capital-Star that he’d ended a $12,000 contract with a salesperson after his premium jumped from $70 to $240. Gehman, 40, owns and operates a video production company, 2085 Productions, based in Waynesboro, pitching projects from Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia. 
“It’s essential. I had to go to the emergency room six, seven years ago when I didn’t have health insurance … and I think the hospital bill was $6,000 or $7,000,” Gehman said. “I was out of work at the time, so it was 100% (covered by) financial assistance.”
“But the reality is, this is why you need health insurance,” he continued. “Because the whoopsies, the mistakes, the accidents happen.”










We’re just hearing a lot of anxiety and concern from people around the trade-offs that they’re going to have to make financially and the risk that they have to take with their health if they end up going uninsured.


– Pennie Director Devon Trolley


Gehman said he started his company in 2019, paying “basically nothing” at first for Pennie. Last year, his business made $75,000, which doesn’t include expenses. 
While he has found a way to balance his checkbook, others aren’t so fortunate. Some have reported paying nearly $1,800 a month for their Pennie coverage. 
“You should be able to work full time and afford health insurance,” Gehman said. “… It’s so high now for a lot of people and they have to choose between, ‘Well, do I want to make my mortgage payment or my health insurance?’ Obviously, they’re going to get rid of health insurance.”
 Falling Pennie enrollment

In 2025, 497,000 Pennsylvanians were enrolled in Pennie — a record-breaking amount. During the enrollment period from Nov. 1, 2024 and Jan. 15, 2025, 90,000 people signed up.
But, more than halfway through this cycle’s enrollment period, overall enrollment numbers are down by 20,000 people and nearly 1,000 terminate their coverage each day, according to Pennie Director Devon Trolley. As of this week, between 465,000 and 472,000 Pennsylvanians are enrolled in Pennie.  The open enrollment period for this year was extended to Feb. 1.
“We don’t have a lot of insight into where people ended up,” Trolley said. “Anecdotally, from our call center … we’ve been hearing pretty consistently that cost has been a major factor this year.”

The most significant premium increases hit those over the age of 55, Trolley said, especially those earning above the enhanced subsidy cutoff — roughly $62,600 for a single person or $84,600 for a family of two. 
“Take a 60-year-old couple, for example. In 2025, they were paying about $500 or $600 a month and now, in 2026, their bill is $2,000 to $3,000 a month,” said Trolley. “In some cases, we’re seeing the monthly premiums for that population comprise upwards of 50% of their income.”
Preventative care for this age group can be critical to identifying chronic conditions and is a core part of the services covered by the Affordable Care Act, as detailed by health policy group KFF.
“Without health coverage, you’re not catching those early, you’re not managing chronic conditions,” said Trolley. “And by the time they do hit Medicare at age 65, the population is going to be sicker and more costly (to cover).”
To 61-year-old Scott Cannon, of Luzerne County, insurance is “a necessity” at his age.
“I can’t not have it, but I know some people younger than me who are gambling and not having it,” said Cannon. “I’m worried for them because if something were to happen, it’d be a tough situation.”

Cannon is a videographer whose wife works part time at the local library. Together, their monthly bill used to be $83 — which was “very affordable” — and now costs $283. 
“It’s tough because the price of everything is going up … I do a lot of videos, television commercials and social media videos for businesses and AI is being used by those businesses instead,” said Cannon. “So business is getting harder and harder to find.” 
After 30 years of using the same landline for his business, Cannon opted to cancel that contract to make up the cost difference. 
While renewing the policy for him and his wife was fairly straightforward, getting coverage for their youngest daughter has been a challenge. 
After turning 19 in November, she no longer qualifies for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but might get her own policy through Medicaid. However, a paperwork mixup seems to have closed that pathway, so the Cannons are looking at adding her to the family plan.
“We’re already paying more than we did last year, so now we’re going to add my daughter’s insurance on top of that,” said Cannon. “In the meantime, I don’t think my daughter’s covered.”
 Over in Congress

Though the credits are designed to make coverage more affordable, it comes with a $1 trillion price tag for the federal government, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending the subsidies for those making about the threshold makes up roughly $35 billion of that estimate. 
The enhanced benefit is a recent development — part of a 2021 COVID-19 relief package that passed under former President Joe Biden and expired at the end of 2025. Extending the subsidies is popular across the country, according to KFF polling, but Republicans point to mounting costs for taxpayers. 
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

In the House, votes fell largely along partisan lines, though three swing district Pennsylvanian representatives joined Democrats to advance the bill: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (1st District), Ryan Mackenzie (7th District) and Rob Bresnahan (8th District).
The commonwealth’s seven other Republican lawmakers voted against the measure. 
The U.S. Senate has been working on its own health care package over the interim, and may not take up the House’s effort. 
Not knowing where Congress will land complicates Pennie’s work, Trolley said. A “straight extension” would be the quickest to implement, she added, but “any changes beyond that would take more time to understand.”
“If congressional action does occur, we would make sure to provide some opportunity for people to come back in and change their mind,” said Trolley. “What that looks like really depends on when exactly an extension would occur and what that extension looks like.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8191-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Jared Polis.
Lawmakers, workers and union members crammed into the space outside the governor’s office in the state Capitol on Thursday to announce the return of the so-called Worker Protection Act. The legislative session begins next week.
“We’re back here because the problem did not go away,” Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat who will once again run the bill, said. “You hear politician after politician saying ‘Affordability, affordability, affordability.’ Well, we are here with an actual, real solution to increase worker power and to increase wages.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Alongside Mabrey, the bill will be backed by Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat and Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat.
The bill, like last year’s version, would get rid of a second union election rule, unique to Colorado, to form what’s known as a strong union. After a majority of workers vote to form a union, as outlined in federal law, there is a second election with a 75% threshold for workers to negotiate which employees need to pay dues. The second election does not compel union membership, but it opens the door to discuss whether all employees should pay into the union representation they benefit from.
“That second election just gives employers more time to intimidate workers and shut down organizing efforts before workers ever get a real seat at the table,” Danielson said.










Service workers are the backbone of our communities, but too many of us can't afford to even live where we work. We should not be punished and our vote should not be delayed.


– Josh Reitze, a cook at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater


Colorado is the only state to have a second election requirement, and workers say it can be an arduous process. Josh Reitze, a cook at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater in Denver’s Sloan’s Lake neighborhood, said his union voted to form in 2024 and began negotiations in September of that year. Members are just now waiting for the results of that second election, 15 months since the union was created.
“Service workers are the backbone of our communities, but too many of us can’t afford to even live where we work. We should not be punished and our vote should not be delayed,” Reitze said. “The Worker Protection Act matters because it would stop companies from dragging out the process and using fear to silence its workers.”
Business groups generally support the second election requirement, which has been Colorado law since the 1940s.
Last year, the Worker Protection Act languished in the Legislature as business groups, legislators and unions tried to reach a compromise at the behest of Polis, who said he would not sign a bill that both sides didn’t agree to. Negotiations collapsed, and the bill passed unchanged with every Democrat in support. Polis, also a Democrat, then vetoed it. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s resurgence.
Mabrey told reporters on Thursday that Polis had “not explicitly” said he would veto this year’s bill, but there has not been discussion with the business community in the legislative interim.
“We do not need a task force to figure this out,” Mabrey said. “We need a governor who has the courage to stand with workers.”
This will be the final regular legislative session with Polis as governor. Sen. Michael Bennet and Attorney General Phil Weiser are the Democrats running to replace him, though neither have said whether they support the legislation.
“Maybe if we fail this year, we can get it done next year,” Mabrey said.
The 120-day legislative session begins on Jan. 14. Democrats hold wide majorities in both chambers.

This is the new reality most bus riders have faced since the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) enacted the most significant service reductions in its 59-year history last September, according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of public transit advocates.
The 14-page report looks at the impact of those cuts on both riders and bus operators as the cash-strapped agency closed a multimillion dollar funding gap that originated with Gov. Dan McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget. When the 2025 legislative session ended last June, RIPTA was still $18 million in the red.
A week before McKee is expected to drop his proposed fiscal 2027 budget, Save RIPTA coalition members joined lawmakers in the State House library to go over their new findings and present a laundry list of bills they want introduced in the 2026 General Assembly to get more Rhode Islanders on the bus.
The report found that 75% of RIPTA’s routes lost ridership since September when the cuts took effect.
“We told y’all what would happen,” Liza Burkin, an organizer with Save RIPTA, told the crowd. 
Save RIPTA’s report notes the agency started the second half of 2024 with the appointment of a permanent CEO while being kept afloat by the last of the state’s pandemic aid granted by the federal government.
“Things were looking up — temporarily,” the report states.
But 2025 did not see the same relief given to RIPTA, resulting in reductions on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history. That’s because McKee initially declined to fill a $32.6 million deficit for the agency as he and other state leaders awaited an overdue efficiency study to find ways to cut costs and “right size” operations.
The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue. RIPTA administrators working with McKee’s office found other savings, but it still was not enough to avoid the service reductions.
The report found RIPTA has been less efficient as an agency since the cuts were made last fall. 
In fiscal year 2025, RIPTA spent $183 per service hour on operations. Now it costs the agency over $236 per service hour — a 29% increase.
At the same time, the report found 21 of RIPTA’s routes operate at least once an hour every day — a statistic referred to as a “lowest minimum frequency standard.” Before service cuts were enacted, the coalition’s report found 33 bus lines operated on at least an hourly basis.
“And we wonder why we can’t grow ridership,” Burkin said. “Frequency is the core — you need to go to the bus stop and know another one will come.”
Chrys Santos, a sophomore at the Blackstone Academy Charter School in Pawtucket, told the crowd she was recently an hour-and-a-half late for class after watching two full buses skip by her stop.
“I missed two of my morning classes and my grades in algebra and Spanish went down by five points,” Santos said.
RIPTA’s cuts haven’t been easy on drivers either. Jorge Alves, who has worked as a bus driver for the last 13 years, said he’s had little break time after trips. He said passengers are becoming more agitated as the less frequent buses start to get more crammed.
“It’s become very stressful to work,” Alves said. “The pressure’s always on you to go faster and get more done in the same amount of time.”

Happy new year with a $14 million deficit
RIPTA’s board of directors in December approved a fiscal 2027 budget request that has a nearly $14 million deficit to send to McKee’s office — with hopes it would be filled by the governor and lawmakers.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said the governor intends to plug RIPTA’s gap in his budget recommendation set to be unveiled next week. She did not state how he would like to see the state plug the agency’s deficit.
But even that funding commitment is still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall.
RIPTA once again counts on Gov. McKee to fill its budget gap

“The $13.8 million is required to run service as it currently exists today,” Sara Furbush, a RIPTA spokesperson, said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
To regain lost service, advocates say the state would need to allocate an additional $5 million — something advocates hope the state will provide to RIPTA through a supplemental budget allocation.
Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, and Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, attended the event in the State House library. They intend to sponsor the legislation that will allocate the additional funding.
“Properly funding RIPTA isn’t a drain on our budgets,” Alzate said. “It is an investment in prosperity in an equitable and sustainable Rhode Island.”
Advocates want to see bus service grow, which is why their biggest priority is to get RIPTA an additional $10 million in annual revenue by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account to 20%.
In the state’s most recent budget, lawmakers had granted RIPTA 15% of the account funded by vehicle registration fees.
Legislation to up RIPTA’s share will be sponsored in the House by Rep. Terri Cortvriend, a Portsmouth Democrat. A Senate sponsor has not yet been identified, Burkin told reporters.
“We need to pass these bills to stabilize finances and start to grow and expand RIPTA, not just save it,” Burkin said. “And that starts today.”



6 ways to better bus service in Rhode Island
Advocates outlined a half dozen additional policy priorities to enhance bus service in Rhode Island. They include bills that Save RIPTA hopes will be introduced in the General Assembly soon, organizer Liza Burkin said.

Shift the state’s existing 7% sales tax on rideshare trips toward RIPTA’s paratransit programs. Save RIPTA’s report projects $10 million to $15 million in annual revenue from the tax. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, and in the House by Jennifer Stewart, a Pawtucket Democrat.
Require companies with 500 or more employees to provide transit passes via RIPTA Wave to Work program. Revenue has not yet been calculated. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Jake Bissailion, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Deputy Speaker Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat.
Put a $100 million bond referendum on this year’s ballot. RIPTA would use proceeds toward capital projects such as new bus shelters, creating dedicated bus lanes, and updating fare technology. Legislation will be sponsored in the Senate by Lamis Vargas, a Cranston Democrat, and in the House by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat.
Raise car inspection fees. Proceeds would go into the Highway Maintenance Account. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Vargas. A primary House sponsor has not been identified.
Restructure RIPTA’s board of directors. The coalition wants to see Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. ousted as RIPTA’s board chairman. Lawmakers in 2023 adopted a plan to reorganize the board with the state’s transportation chief heading the board to broaden oversight of the bus agency. Legislation to undo that shakeup would be sponsored in the Senate by Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Tanzi.
Adjust the gas tax to account for inflation every two years. Projections only consider inflation from the previous year. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Stewart.

At left is PSC chair Randy Christmann. (Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two power companies are asking the North Dakota Public Service Commission to make a determination that some local zoning ordinances along a proposed powerline are overly restrictive, which would trigger a new law that says state zoning rules trump local ordinances for transmission lines. 
An attorney representing Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities announced the request Thursday at the start of a hearing on the Jamestown to Ellendale high-voltage powerline project, also known as JETx.
Jason Weiers, manager of transmission policy and contracts for Otter Tail Power, testified that overly restrictive ordinances in townships along the proposed route threaten to make the project unfeasible. 
Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities would jointly construct, own and operate the 92-mile powerline. The companies asked the three-person PSC to find the setback ordinances of some townships overly restrictive, making the state’s 500-foot setback from occupied residences the standard. 
Weiers said Homer and Corwin townships in Stutsman County and Willowbank Township in LaMoure County have passed ordinances requiring that high-voltage powerlines be 2,640 feet, or half a mile, away from an occupied residence. 
Weiers said in Homer Township the setback is essentially a “ban on the development of high-voltage power lines.” In Corwin and Willowbank, the setback makes routing the powerline  “nearly impossible.” 
Three townships in LaMoure County — Russell, Wano and Willowbank — also have passed moratoriums on high-voltage power lines. Weiers said the moratoriums “appear to target the project directly.”
North Dakota using new split hearing option on controversial power line

The Legislature passed a bill in 2025 specifying that state zoning rules can supersede local ordinances. The law took effect Aug. 1. The JETx project was referenced in testimony about the bill. 
The companies say the project is needed to improve grid reliability in the Jamestown area, which has been hit by both winter and summer storms in recent years, forcing power use to be curtailed. 
Rob Frank, director of electric transmission engineering for MDU, said the line connecting to two other high-voltage lines offers “significant reliability benefits” and also would improve transmission into South Dakota. 
The companies hope to start construction later this year with completion in 2028. 
Weiers said the project is estimated to cost $406 million. He said routing around townships with restrictive ordinances could add $24 million to the cost. 
The project would use 502 single pole supports that would be 120 feet to 180 feet tall. 
The PSC set aside two days for a technical hearing on the project, with Otter Tail and MDU officials providing detailed information. 
Next week, the PSC will hold hearings in Ellendale, Edgeley and Jamestown to gather public input. It is the first time the PSC has used a newly established process for holding separate technical and public hearings. 
Weiers said 134 of 173 landowners — 77% — along the route have signed agreements to allow the powerline to run through their property. He said that equates to 76% of the length of the 92 mile line.  
The Public Service Commission previously approved a certificate of need for the project but still needs to approve a route permit.

Commission Chairman Randy Christmann voted against the project last year and Thursday asked more questions. 
“Is it about hooking up to renewables or is it about reliability?” he asked Weiers, referring to wind power in the area. 
Weiers said that the project benefits improved transmission from wind turbines west of Ellendale and grid reliability. 
Christmann asked Frank why easement signings seemed to be low and resistance from townships is unusually high. 
Frank cited “landowner fatigue” to new projects of all kinds but said easement signings were typical for a powerline project. 
“Some landowners are unwilling to sign over property rights for anything,” he said.

Andy Ogles of Tennessee's 5th Congressional District responded by calling for Nashville's mayor to be arrested. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)On Tuesday, after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in Minneapolis at close range by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee’s 5th District didn’t wait too long to weigh in with his opinions. 
If you’ve been following Ogles, who was first elected to Congress in 2022, you won’t be surprised to hear he didn’t offer sympathy. 
No, he posted first on social media that Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell should be arrested. 
“Minneapolis Mayor (Jacob) Frey and Nashville Mayor O’Connell are cut from the same cloth. It’s deeper than rhetoric, its (sic) political decisions intended to betray ICE and Federal partners. ICE agents are in danger because of them. Illegal aliens are NOT our friends. They should be arrested immediately,” wrote Ogles on X and Facebook. 
The reference to Mayor Frey came after he said, in a press conference following the shooting, that ICE needs to “get the f- – – out of Minneapolis.” 
Four hours later, he posted, “Send the (National) Guard to Nashville!” and said that the shooting of Good was justified. 
There’s a lot to unpack here but what stands out — beyond the obviously heinous and inhumane support for the killing of an innocent woman by federal agents — is a sitting congressman’s apparent willingness to call out the military in his own district, for what appears to be no reason other than to mess with the mayor of the largest city in that district. 
Besides the fact that O’Connell has done nothing more than say about May ICE raids in Nashville that “these people don’t share our values,” Ogles’ call for arresting him shines a dangerous spotlight on O’Connell in a period in which political violence is a clear and present danger. 

Pray for our ICE patriots. Democrats continue to demonize the men and women doing everything in their power to make our country safe.
If you put an ICE agent in mortal danger, self-defense is JUSTIFIED. https://t.co/iIALKYhzFz
— Rep. Andy Ogles (@RepOgles) January 7, 2026

Less than a year ago, a man dressed as a police officer murdered Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband after shooting a state senator and his wife. 
Surely, I thought to myself — surely — some members of our federal delegation will respond to the shooting in a more dignified and compassionate way. 
U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen of the Memphis-based 9th Congressional District and the only Democrat in the delegation, issued a statement.
“Today’s incident is just what I feared: out-of-control, masked ICE agents fatally misusing their authority and inflaming our communities. Today, it happened in Minneapolis, but it could be Memphis, which also has an outsized and aggressive ICE presence,” the statement read. 
I decided to check the social media feeds of the other members of Tennessee’s federal delegation, including U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, and found little. 
U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Knoxville’s 2nd Congressional District, used the somber day to call for investigation into the immigration records of his Democratic colleague, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congresswoman who was born in Somalia but emigrated to the U.S. with her family when she was 13. 
To initiate such proceedings at all, but especially on the day an American citizen was gunned down in the district Omar represents, is beyond petty: It’s callous, repugnant and hateful.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially deployed thousands of ICE agents to Minneapolis as part of a Trump administration operation targeting Somalian immigrants, all because an article claimed — with little evidence to support it — that Somalian residents are defrauding public programs in the state and using the money gained to fund terrorist organizations. 
It may be a new low for Burchett, but at least we know where he stands. 
Finding nothing on Wednesday’s social media feeds of Tennessee’s other six U.S. representatives and two senators reflecting on the Minnesota tragedy, I emailed their press secretaries. 
I heard back from only 6th District Rep. John Rose, a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. 
In a statement, Rose said, “What happened in Minneapolis is tragic. No one wants to see a young woman lose her life or children lose their mother. It’s awful.
“But, we must acknowledge the facts. Multiple law enforcement officials were attempting to communicate with Ms. Good who, rather than responding in a reasonable manner, steered her car and accelerated toward a federal law enforcement official,” read the statement.  Life-saving action was taken to prevent the death of that officer.”
I give him credit for responding, although the videos viewed by my colleagues at the Minnesota Reformer do not support this version of events;  from the other members of the delegation, I received nothing: not a “no comment,” much less a tepid “thoughts and prayers” comment of the type our elected officials usually offer. 
Again, I checked their social media accounts on Thursday. 
Blackburn, also running in the Republican gubernatorial primary, called for the denaturalization of anyone “who comes to the United States to steal from the American people” by committing fraud. 
A few months ago, Charlie Kirk, a right wing podcaster, was shot and killed by a private citizen at a speaking event and these same representatives didn’t hesitate to post that they were “devastated” by his murder — which is fine and appropriate. Kirk’s murder was horrendous and lawmakers of both major political persuasions should have, and did, speak out against it and political violence in general. 
Yet, most of the same Tennessee lawmakers that expressed sadness and rage over one killing, expressed not an ounce of empathy for Good’s family or offered solace to their own constituents feeling fear, hurt and sadness.
Know that most, if not all, of these representatives will be reelected in November, and unless electoral trends experience a cataclysmic reversal in the next eight months, Rose or Blackburn will be Tennessee’s next governor.
It’s important to assess their reactions to the killing of a citizen by government agents, because while I hope this is the last such incident, I am fearful it will not be.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A legislative task force on hazing on Louisiana’s college campuses is recommending increased required training for all students — not just those in Greek organizations — and greater penalties for universities that shirk their obligations. 
The task force, named in honor of Southern University student Caleb Wilson, who died in a hazing incident last year, is composed of legislators, public higher education officials and college students. Five people have been indicted in connection with Wilson’s February death during a pledge initiation for the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. The chapter has been removed from Southern’s campus though it has the option to appeal and return.
Members of the task force, created last year by Southern alumnus Rep. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans, met for the final time Thursday. They voted to recommend legislation that would require annual anti-hazing training for public college and university students and advisers to student organizations, who are typically school faculty or staff members. The legislative panel also emphasized the need to require the training for “external advisers” who are not university employees such as those who work with Greek organizations. 
The task force considered a proposal to require training for all faculty and staff, but LSU Vice President and General Counsel Trey Jones, a task force member, raised concerns that a mandate for thousands of employees was overbroad. The task force settled on expanding the requirement to more faculty and staff members, though the legislature will have to determine which employees will be required to take part in the training. 
The group also recommended adopting amnesty policies that would allow students to report hazing without fear of repercussions for violating other university policies. 
The panel also agreed it was key to roll back a 2024 law, Act 416 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, that dramatically increased the standard of evidence required to prove a hazing charge in campus disciplinary proceedings from “preponderance of evidence” to “clear and convincing.” 
Under the old standard, administrators could hold a student responsible if the evidence points to it being at least slightly more likely than not the student is responsible. Even if there is conflicting testimony, a student whistleblower could be punished if the evidence tipped the scale just past a 50% likelihood. 
Now universities need clear and convincing evidence, a standard used in some court cases such as proving fraud or terminating parental rights. The threshold requires evidence that points to the student’s guilt being substantially more probable than not, and it might require multiple witnesses, photos or other reports to firmly convince administrators.
Clearing that bar can be difficult because, unlike in courtroom proceedings, administrators don’t have as much power to gather evidence. 
University officials on the panel said the new standard of evidence makes it nearly impossible to hold students accountable for hazing and could eventually lead to schools not attempting to discipline students for offenses because it could open them up to legal liability. 
The task force also recommended universities include a section on hazing in the annual power-based violence reports they make to the legislature, and that the information is also posted to universities’ websites. Under current law, schools that fail to submit the reports are prohibited from going before the state Bond Commission for two years, effectively limiting them from any of major infrastructure or building projects during that period. The same penalty was  recommended for failure to submit a hazing report. 
The group also highlighted the need to identify dedicated dollars to support hazing prevention, training and reporting. 
Their priorities are likely to be addressed in the upcoming legislative session, which begins March 9. Rep. Vanessa LaFleur, D-Baton Rouge, said lawmakers will meet soon to decide who will sponsor the bills. 
Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said he would also sponsor legislation to clarify the difference between suspending and expelling a student organization.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)An investigation of unlawful computer use and computer-generated pornography sharing by a former employee of the state Division of Motor Vehicles has turned up at least 50 victims, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley announced Thursday.
Mark Rathbun, 68, of Aberdeen, was initially indicted in November for solicitation of rape, possession of child pornography and unauthorized use of computer systems. Those charges related to two victims, one of whom he’d been involved in a “domestic relationship” with, according to court documents.
At the time, Jackley said investigators following up on a tip about child pornography found driver’s license images on some of the 30 electronic devices in Rathbun’s home. Jackley’s office declined to outline any connections there may be between the victims of driver’s license data theft and computer-generated pornography, citing the ongoing investigation.
The investigation was likely to turn up more victims, Jackley said at a November press conference.
Attorney general charges former state employee with computer misuse, child porn, rape solicitation

This week, Rathbun was named in an 85-count indictment that references 50 victims. One of the indictment’s 26 counts of child porn possession relates to a video of an unnamed minor engaged in a sex act; the other 25 are tied to “computer-generated” pornographic images of real children, identified by initials. Some of the children’s initials are tied to multiple images.
Eighteen counts involve the alleged dissemination or sale of computer-generated pornography, again involving imagery of real people identified by initials, some of whom were younger than 17. 
The remaining 40 charges are for unlawful use of computer systems. The indictment lists 10 counts for accessing “confidential driver’s license data or material pertaining to” victims without specifying exactly what information may have been taken. The rest relate to Rathbun’s alleged copying or obtaining of driver’s license image files.
Based on the initials listed in the indictment, two of the alleged victims of driver’s license data theft were also depicted in computer-generated pornography. One victim whose photo was allegedly lifted from the driver’s license system was depicted in 10 separate computer-generated images.
“We continue to review images found on his electronic devices and will reach out to potential victims for notification,” Jackley said in his Thursday news release.
If convicted on all counts, Rathbun faces up to 395 years in prison.
Rathbun is one of numerous former state employees charged with crimes over the past two years. One former Department of Social Services employee named Lonna Carroll was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of $1.8 million from the state across multiple years. Other former state employees have been accused or found guilty of forging food service inspections, falsifying child abuse reports, creating false vehicle titles and issuing themselves a medical marijuana card.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature is taking steps to improve security for its members, including removing requirements in state law for home addresses to be publicly disclosed and initiating security training for all lawmakers. 
Lawmakers on Thursday directed legislative staff to prepare a memo describing how both initiatives can be accomplished following a confidential security briefing from the North Dakota Highway Patrol. 
“We live in a different world than we lived in 10 years ago,” said Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, during a discussion following the confidential briefing. 
The briefing, which presented a threat assessment of the Capitol complex and guidance to legislators who receive threats, prompted both concerns and shrugs from some lawmakers. 
North Dakota lawmakers to hold hearing on security concerns after Minnesota attacks

Reps. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, and Anna Novak, R-Hazen, live in rural communities. They said there is a limit to the security precautions they can take when most of their community can recognize their vehicles or homes on sight. 
“The reality is, especially for those of us in rural areas, everybody knows where we live,” Weisz said. “It’s not like you can have any security sitting out on your farmstead.”
At the same time, they said they appreciated the briefing from law enforcement, which was prompted in part by the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers last June. Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home.
“She was attacked in her home,” Novak said. “That’s the scary part. But I live in a small town, very much pro Second Amendment, and so I feel pretty safe because of that.”
Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also wounded in a shooting at their home, and investigators found a list of other Democratic lawmakers in the vehicle of Vance Boelter, who has been charged with the crimes.
The Highway Patrol did not make any policy recommendations during the confidential session, but the information prompted two proposals from lawmakers. 
In addition to the security training sessions for all legislators and staff at the start of every legislative session, there was also a lot of concern that state law requires lawmakers to include their home addresses on several filings that executive branch agencies are in turn required to make available to the public. 
“They are required to disclose our home address,” said. Rep. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo. “We need to think about where else in code, where else on the web, are we disclosing addresses?”
The committee directed Legislative Council to prepare a list of places in state law that need to be amended in order to change that. John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, encouraged legislators to begin using post office boxes when they have to provide contact information.

The Capitol threat assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities in the building and will not be disclosed to the public. Weisz said the Highway Patrol may ask for additional funding for security during the next regular legislative session but no specifics of the threat assessment were provided. North Dakota installed metal detectors at the public entrance of the Capitol in 2017, a response to Dakota Access Pipeline protests, which also included some demonstrations in Bismarck. The security measure was made permanent after that legislative session. 
While there has not been a notable long-term increase in threats reported by lawmakers to the Highway Patrol, North Dakota is not insulated against potential threats crossing state lines, Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse said. 
“North Dakota isn’t immune from people coming from other states as well,” Clawson Huibregtse said. “Threats that come in to political officials aren’t necessarily always people that are from North Dakota.”
Weisz is one of the lawmakers who has received multiple threats against himself and his family over time. It’s not pleasant, but there isn’t much he can do but take common sense precautions, Weisz said. 
“I’m not gonna live my life in fear,” he said. 
Security costs
Personal security, especially while at home, has been a prominent concern among lawmakers since the Minnesota attacks. Legislative Council removed legislators’ home addresses from the website shortly afterwards. 
Yet while the Highway Patrol provides security at the Capitol complex and can provide assistance at official events elsewhere in the state, there are few options for legislators who desire more protection in their districts or at their homes. The Highway Patrol, authorized to employ 171 officers, does not have the staffing to provide regular assistance to all 141 state lawmakers. 
State lawmakers reconsider costs, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

The North Dakota Ethics Commission, a few weeks after the shooting in the neighboring state, issued an advisory opinion interpreting state law as allowing campaign funds to be used on security expenditures in certain situations. Attorney General Drew Wrigley overruled that in a legal opinion of his own late last year, declaring the advisory opinion void. 
Some states like Minnesota offer stipends to lawmakers for security costs. North Dakota is not one of them. But the National Conference of State Legislatures is planning to launch a new $1.5 million Security Fund next month that may fill some of the gap. 
Bryan Thomas, chief communications officer, said every state legislature will receive funding based on its membership count. The legislatures will have the flexibility to spend the dollars as they see fit, whether on group training sessions or stipends to individuals for small purchases like doorbell cameras, as long as it is broadly available and not limited to a select few lawmakers. 
“There’ll be really flexible dollars that legislatures will have access to, to support their members to help a little bit in their security for themselves and their families,” Thomas said. 
He said there is sufficient funding to provide an average of $200 per legislator across the country. That’s far less than stipends offered by some states, such as Minnesota, which provides a stipend up to $4,500 for home security. But if the program is successful and the organization can identify additional funding, it could continue in future years. 
“$200 doesn’t go a long way, but it certainly helps,” Thomas said.

“Her commitment to public service and her ability to navigate complex policy issues make her uniquely qualified to help navigate important decisions and support increased transparency and accountability for key public investment approved by the Board of Public Works. I am thrilled to welcome her to Team Comptroller,” Lierman’s statement said.
Jones stepped down from the rostrum in December. Lambert, along with Jones’ Chief of Staff Matt Jackson and Communications Director Marty McGowan, were replaced as new House Speaker Joseline Peña Melnyk moved staff from her legislative and committee offices into those senior positions.
Earlier this week, Senate President Bill Ferguson announced Jackson has joined his office.
Also on Wednesday, Lierman announced Thomas Brennan III, a five-year veteran of the office, was promoted to serve as her liaison to the Board of Public Works — a deputy to Lambert.
“It is a pleasure to have Thomas Brennan as our Board of Public Works Liaison. He is an invaluable member of our team whose diligence, expertise, and commitment are invaluable to our approach to board business,” Lierman said in her statement. “I look forward to seeing Thomas grow into his new role and the strong partnership he and Director Lambert will form in the coming year.”

Jan. 8, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Calling affordable child care vital to Nebraska’s workforce, business leaders joined other advocates Thursday in championing a proposed state law to extend current income eligibility levels for a child care subsidy.
Hunter Traynor, executive vice president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry was among dozens gathered at the State Capitol in support of Legislative Bill 304, which would make permanent the income eligibility caps enacted into law in 2021.

Now set to expire in October, income eligibility for the state child care subsidy program was raised from 130% to 185% of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that meant household earnings could be $59,000 instead of $42,000.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, who was part of a bipartisan group of about 20 lawmakers supporting the bill, said she has named LB 304 her priority legislation for the 2026 session.
The bill stalled last year in a committee, as state officials estimated the annual financial impact at about $14 million in general funds. The state’s latest shortfall is estimated at $471 million. DeBoer said Thursday she was working with the Department of Health and Human Services to find the additional funding to support the bill.
“While there is a cost to this child care assistance, the cost to the state of doing nothing is much larger,” she said. “So we will find a fiscal solution.”
Said Traynor: “Passing this legislation would help nearly 3,000 families remain eligible for child care assistance and help employers remain fully staffed in an extremely tight labor market.”
Child care providers and advocacy agencies said that was a conservative number.

Traynor pointed to a recent report estimating the annual state impact of inadequate child care at $1.7 billion in lost business output and $1.6 billion in lost labor income, including both direct and multiplier effects. He said that leads to a loss of nearly $64 million in state income tax revenue and 6,843 jobs. 
The report was prepared for the Nebraska Chamber Foundation in partnership with First Five Nebraska and the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It says that the median annual cost for child care services ranges between $9,000 and $15,000 per child for center-based care.
DeBoer said the state was at a “crisis point” in 2021 when it changed the child care subsidy eligibility levels to help parents remain in the workplace. She said assistance came in other ways as well, including streamlining the process for background checks of child care workers.
“The work isn’t done,” she said.
If the bill does not pass, child care representatives said Nebraska would fall to No. 48 in the nation for access to child care subsidies based on income eligibility. Currently, Nebraska ranks at 38, said First Five Nebraska, a child care advocacy agency. 
Nebraska’s child care assistance program is funded by a mix of federal and state funds for a total of about $110 million a year, First Five said. 
Former Nebraska football player Derek Branch also spoke, urging former Husker defensive back Gov. Jim Pillen to stand by “working families and their children” by supporting the bill.
“Now is not the time to drop the ball,” Branch said.

 ‘My lifeline’

Haley Overman, a widowed mom of three children, said she would be among the families that would lose a child care subsidy if the eligibility income levels were to return to previous levels in October.
“It’s basically my lifeline,” she said, noting that she lost a second income when her husband died. 
Overman, who works in the medical billing industry, said she has a house and car payment and is uncertain of how her family life would change further if she lost the child care subsidy. She said she might have to sell their home. 
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, also among the speakers, also turned to Nebraska’s workforce concerns in voicing support for the bill. 
“This is a practical, Nebraska-focused investment, one that supports work, strengthens families and keeps businesses competitive in both rural and urban communities,” he said.

Melanie Stansbury celebrated the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a measure to renew health insurance subsidies Thursday.,"U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) addresses attendees at an Oct. 20, 2025 Rio Rancho town hall. Stansbury called the Jan. 8, 2026 passage of a proposal to renew and extend health insurance subsidies ‘a huge deal.’ (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-New Mexico) on Thursday called the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a measure to renew health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of 2025 “a huge deal,” in a call with news media.
“These subsidies help to massively expand the number of uninsured individuals to actually have access to health care,” said Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District. The bill advanced on a 230-196 vote, with 17 Republicans joining House Democrats to send it to the Senate.
The expiration of subsidies created by Congress in 2021 for the Affordable Care Act was the main factor in prompting the longest ever federal government shutdown late last year.
Republicans wouldn’t agree to extend subsidies for the cost of health care insurance in state marketplaces, so millions of Americans as of January face increases for the costs of copays, deductibles, and premiums.
Just before the holiday recess, four Republican members joined House Democrats in forcing the vote, defying Republican leadership. On Wednesday — in a new session of Congress — nine Republicans joined Democrats on the procedural action to take up the issue.
Stansbury said the current version of the bill, which extends tax subsidies for the next three years, will likely see changes in the Senate, where similar measures failed to advance in December.
“But it does create a new political pathway and pressure in the Senate and with the White House, especially with Republican support, to get some sort of extension, hopefully, in the coming weeks,” Stansbury said.

While the sticker shock is driving declines for enrollment in other states, New Mexico earlier this week reported a third enrollment increase.
Prior to the subsidies’ expiration, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers in a special legislative session in October, approved $17.3 million to offset the costs of tax credits, covering the portion the federal government paid for 6,000 New Mexicans whose income is more than 400% of the federal poverty level.
Stansbury on Thursday praised the state government’s “very proactive” actions during the special session, but said Congressional action for the extension would be needed to ensure the approximately 27,000 New Mexicans currently requiring state assistance can access health insurance coverage.
In her budget request for the 2027 fiscal year, Lujan Grisham proposed the Legislature allot more than $81 million during the upcoming 2026 Legislative session to “to keep health insurance affordable for New Mexicans.” The Legislative Finance Committee’s version of the budget proposal recommends earmarking $126.6 million to the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund to lower the costs for health care.
In addition to the health care subsidies, Stansbury expressed condolences during the call with news outlets for the family of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed Wednesday by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis.

“Many across the United States, including in New Mexico, are feeling afraid,” Stansbury said. “We’re receiving literally hundreds of calls from New Mexicans right now, who are scared about what might happen next, what the administration might do next, whether or not they’re going to come and invade our community.”
She said she and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) will bring articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, saying the department has “has abused its authority, as committed acts of violence,” and also cited the reports of Noem’s alleged self-dealing in violation of ethics rules.
She told members of the news media that she was not necessarily concerned about an increased presence of immigration authorities in New Mexico. “The risk is there, but we are doing all of the things that we can as both the members of Congress, state officials and local officials to make sure the New Mexicans are safe and that the legal rights of New Mexicans are protected,” she said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa House Democrats said Thursday they plan to propose a constitutional amendment during the upcoming legislative session to prevent future changes to the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System.
Concerns about potential changes arose during discussions by a task force appointed by Gov. Kim Reynolds aimed at saving taxpayer dollars.
Rep. Sean Bagniewski, House minority whip, and Senate Majority Leader Janice Weiner answered questions from reporters about their plans and expectations for the 2026 legislative session at the Iowa Capitol Press Association legislative preview forum Thursday. Republican leaders, House Speaker Pat Grassley, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh and Reynolds, were invited but declined to attend.
The discussion of retirement plans was started by the Iowa DOGE task force, which suggested in August the state might move the public employees’ retirement system from a defined benefits program to a defined contribution program, where both the employee and employer would contribute to the retirement fund.
This proposal was met with significant backlash from public employees and advocates who said the change could endanger IPERS’ solvency. In the task force’s final list of  recommendations submitted to Reynolds, the proposal was changed to suggest Iowa conducts an ongoing study of of public employees’ benefits — which would include examining the viability of a defined contribution plan. If feasible, the task force suggested public employees be allowed to decide if they want to stay on IPERS in its current form or move to a defined contribution plan, while not making changes to IPERS for current public employees.
Several Republican lawmakers have stated there is currently no interest in making changes to IPERS. But Democrats said Thursday that does not mean Iowans should stop paying attention to the issue.
“I keep hearing from Republican colleagues, ‘They don’t have the appetite for it this year,'” Weiner said. “… So my question is, does that mean they’ll have the appetite for it next year, or the year after that? IPERS is a well-run system. It is essential for recruiting and retaining employees for the state of Iowa, for our correctional system, for our law enforcement, our teachers, and we should not meddle with it, period.”
Bagniewski said House Democrats have similar concerns. He pointed to Republicans’ approach in 2017 to changing public sector collective bargaining law and the 2023 Education Savings Account program as examples of policy where Republicans said, “there’s just a proposal, we’re just talking about it, we’re not going to do it. And then all of a sudden, they’re doing it.”
Because Democrats are concerned about Republicans deciding to later move forward with a proposal to change IPERS, Bagniewski said the House minority party plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to “protect IPERS.”
“We’re going to make Iowa Republican put their money where their mouth is,” Bagniewski said. “If they really want to preserve IPERS, then they’re going to have to do it.”
Bagniewski said the proposed constitutional amendment would bar the Legislature from making major changes to the current set-up of IPERS — particularly preventing future changes like the task force’s proposed opt-in or opt-out from the defined benefits program structure. He said this proposal is necessary in order to prevent the Legislature from taking actions that could threaten IPERS stability for both future and current employees.
“The whole system is built on the people who are currently in, paying for the people who retire,” Bagniewski said. So once you take that out, and then you have a deficit, the whole system explodes. So we want to preserve it in its current form by the Constitution.”
Amendments to the state Constitution must be passed by the Iowa Legislature in two consecutive general assemblies, and then go before voters on the next general election ballot. If approved by a simple majority as a ballot measure, the amendment will be adopted.

U.S. District Court Judge Stefan R. Underhill, who is the presiding judge for Diamantis’ upcoming federal trial on corruption charges, suggested that Pattis continue to represent Diamantis at a public defender’s rate.
“If you are asking, then I will do it,” Pattis told the judge during the hearing, which took place Thursday evening on Zoom.
Underhill then said he was going to delay the trial until at least April.
Jury selection for Diamantis’ second corruption trial was supposed to begin on Jan. 30, but Pattis told prosecutors and Underhill that a murder trial that he started this week in New London would not be done by then, and prosecutors said they are preparing for another trial scheduled for March.
Diamantis was found guilty by a jury in October of 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators in his role as head of the state school construction grants office. He remains free on a $500,000 bond.
Diamantis, Connecticut’s former deputy budget director and a former state legislator, was convicted of using his position overseeing the state’s school construction office to enrich himself and his family by accepting bribes from contractors on school projects in Hartford and Tolland.
Underhill delayed sentencing on that case until after the second trial, where he faces charges related to a Medicaid fraud scheme. Diamantis faces up to 12 years in prison for his October convictions.
Pattis had asked to be removed as Diamantis’ attorney last month, claiming that his client owed him at least $65,000, according to court records. Pattis and Diamantis appeared at a closed-door hearing before the U.S. Magistrate S. Dave Vatti last month to present their cases.
Vatti issued an eight-page ruling late Thursday afternoon just minutes before Underhill’s scheduled status conference with Pattis and federal prosecutors. 
“Diamantis’ failure to fulfill the $65,000 payment obligation is substantial under the circumstances,” Vatti wrote.
“He (Diamantis) objects that he has already paid nearly 75% of the total $250,000 fee and he argues that it is not uncommon for courts to deny requests to withdraw as criminal defense counsel where significant fees have already been paid, the client appears unable to make further payments, and substitute counsel would need time to catch up.”
But Vatti ruled Pattis was “not an indentured servant,” and forcing him to in effect represent Diamantis at a second trial for free was unfair.
Diamantis is facing bribery, extortion and filing false statement charges in the next trial, which centers around a $600,000 payment that Diamantis helped hand-deliver to another state agency to get a Medicaid audit of a Bristol eye doctor canceled.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Christopher Ziogas, also a former state representative, hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to the state Department of Social Services in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that the eye doctor Helen Zervas — Ziogas’ fiancée — improperly billed.

After that check was delivered to the Department of Social Services office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period.
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
But in November, Ziogas pleaded guilty to extortion and bribery charges for his part in pressuring state employees to cancel the audit. He admitted in court that he helped Zervas pay Diamantis $100,000 to help stifle the audit.

Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing 70 to 87 months in prison. Zervas also pleaded guilty, although a sentencing date has not yet been set.
While their plea agreements do not indicate that they must testify against Diamantis at his trial, Pattis has said he expects both of them will be witnesses for the government.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_046-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Delaware officials have released an updated 2025 Climate Action Plan, outlining new long-term strategies to address climate and environmental concerns — even as state and federal data show Delaware already meets or exceeds most existing environmental standards.
The plan, finalized in early 2026, identifies transportation, industrial activity, and electrical power generation as the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the state. It sets a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and builds on Delaware’s first Climate Action Plan, released in 2021.
State leaders say the update is necessary to address long-term risks such as sea-level rise, rising temperatures, and more frequent severe storms. However, critics and policy observers question whether the new plan responds to regulatory necessity or advances broader policy objectives at a time when Delaware remains in full environmental compliance.
Air Quality Already Meets Federal Standards
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Delaware currently meets all federal air-quality standards under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
The state’s EPA-approved air-monitoring network tracks pollutants including ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. While particulate readings rose briefly in 2023 due to Canadian wildfire smoke, those incidents were classified as “exceptional events” and did not count against compliance.
Long-term emissions of major air pollutants continue to trend downward, consistent with national reductions driven by cleaner fuels, vehicle standards, and industrial controls.
Water Quality in Compliance, With Ongoing Restoration Efforts
Delaware’s water-quality standards are governed by the federal Clean Water Act and must be reviewed and approved by the EPA every three years. The state’s most recent update took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
DNREC reports Delaware meets federal monitoring and reporting requirements, though it continues long-term restoration efforts in specific watersheds, including the Inland Bays. These efforts operate under EPA-approved Total Maximum Daily Load plans and reflect ongoing improvement work rather than regulatory failure.
Climate Policy Already Exceeds Federal Requirements
Over the past five years, Delaware has adopted climate policies that exceed baseline federal requirements. The 2021 Climate Action Plan and the 2023 Climate Change Solutions Act established binding targets of a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The state publishes annual implementation reports tracking progress on energy-efficiency programs, electric-vehicle incentives, and building standards. Federal law does not require states to adopt statutory emissions targets or formal climate-action plans.
“Climate change is real, and it is affecting Delaware and Delawareans in serious ways,” said Greg Patterson, secretary of DNREC. He said the updated plan focuses on practical outcomes such as cleaner air, reduced flooding, and improved land-use planning — benefits he said can deliver value regardless of one’s views on climate science.
“We are talking about strategies for cleaner air, more walkable communities, less flooding, more trees and forests, productive farmland, and higher-quality wetlands,” Patterson said.
Aligning With Progressive States — Not High-Growth States
Delaware’s net-zero strategy places the state alongside California, Colorado, Illinois, and Maryland, which have adopted similar long-term emissions mandates.
However, Jane Brady, chairperson of A Better Delaware, has noted that most of the nation’s fastest-growing states — including Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arizona — are not pursuing net-zero mandates. Colorado is the lone exception among high-growth states.
Brady has argued that the contrast raises questions about whether net-zero strategies are driven more by political alignment than by demonstrated economic or population-growth outcomes.
“The states experiencing the strongest job and population growth are largely not pursuing net-zero mandates,” Brady has said, pointing out that Delaware already meets federal environmental standards and questioning whether additional climate policies will deliver measurable benefits relative to their costs.
Academic Skepticism on Local Climate Impacts
Some critics also point to statements from former University of Delaware climatologist David Legates, who has questioned whether current global-warming trends pose an immediate or existential threat to life in Delaware.
Legates, who served for decades as Delaware’s state climatologist, has argued that while climate conditions do change over time, there is limited evidence that recent warming trends are endangering human life in the First State. He has noted that challenges such as storms and coastal flooding are longstanding issues that have historically been addressed through infrastructure investment, land-use planning, and emergency preparedness rather than emissions mandates.
Legates has cautioned against framing climate change as a crisis requiring sweeping regulatory or economic action, emphasizing instead adaptation, resilience, and cost-benefit analysis — particularly in states like Delaware that already meet federal environmental standards.
Debate Shifts From Compliance to Policy Direction
Governor Matt Meyer said the updated plan is intended to protect residents while supporting job creation and long-term economic stability. He cited flooding, extreme rainfall, and urban heat as challenges already affecting communities.
Patterson emphasized that the Climate Action Plan is not a fixed mandate but a flexible framework, with scheduled updates in 2027 and 2029 ahead of the next full plan in 2030.
“Actions may change over time based on increased understanding of climate impacts, technology advancements, and stakeholder input,” he said.
With Delaware already meeting federal air and water standards — and exceeding baseline climate-planning expectations — the debate now centers less on environmental compliance and more on how aggressively the state should pursue additional climate policies, at what cost, and with what measurable return for taxpayers, businesses, and families.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01-TheMostPopularBeachesinCoastalDelaware.webp,,,2026-01-08 18:11:49.589037

The woman, 37-year-old Renee Good, was in Minneapolis as a neutral observer of ICE actions during protests of immigration enforcement following a mass deployment of ICE agents in the city.
Salinas’ bill would prohibit ICE personnel from going onto public school grounds and church properties without notice.
“No child or person should fear being abducted or risk having their family ripped apart when they leave their home,” Salinas said in a statement. “We are losing friends, neighbors, caretakers, and community members daily.”
Federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Tennessee National Guard, have been operating a Memphis Safe Task Force since September.
A researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Salinas moved to America from Bolivia with her family when she was 7, and she has often spoken about the welcome they received while obtaining citizenship through a bipartisan bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican.
Salinas pointed out incidents such as the Minneapolis shooting death show “how lawless and dangerous” ICE interactions with the public have become.
“Now is the time that we as Tennesseans come together and to reject fear and violence and recognize our shared humanity. We are all children of God,” she said.
Salinas is likely to run into hurdles from the Republican supermajority as she tries to pass this legislation.
House Republican leaders are considering whether to bring back a bill that would allow public schools to check the citizenship status of all students and either block enrollment or charge tuition.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton said he plans to roll out a package of immigration-related bills.
Asked about the safe haven bill from ICE, Sexton called it “a terrible idea.”

Phil Murphy speaking at Ramsey High School on Jan. 8, 2026, before signing a bill that will ban cellphones in K-12 classrooms beginning next school year. (Photo by Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office.)
New Jersey public school districts will be required to bar their students from using cellphones and other smart devices during school hours under a bill signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy Thursday.
Murphy, a Democrat whose second term ends on Jan. 20, had made banning phones during class a priority of his final year in office. He signed the bill during a ceremony in Ramsey High School, where classrooms have been phone-free for a year already.
Murphy said that within four months of Ramsey High School’s cellphone ban, nearly 80% of teachers reported increased engagement in class and a majority of the faculty observed greater student-to-student interaction, fewer classroom distractions, and more attentive students.
“When you talk to educators and parents in school districts that have enacted similar cellphone bans, you will often hear the same thing. Students are more focused, they’re less anxious, and they are socializing and laughing with each other, not through a screen, but in the hallways and classrooms. So with the legislation I’m signing today, we’re going to fundamentally improve the learning environment for every K-through-12 student by requiring every school district to follow the lead of campuses just like this one,” he said.
Under the new law, the state’s education commission will be required to develop guidelines on restricting the use of cellphones and other internet-enabled devices during regular school hours, on a bus, or during certain school-sanctioned events. Boards of education will then be required to adopt policies consistent with the state guidelines.
The state guidelines will be required to be written within 90 days so the new policies can go into place by the start of the 2026-27 school year.
Students will be able to use their phones in case of an emergency, for translation services, and in cases where the school receives documentation from a health care professional indicating that access to a phone is necessary.
Principals and administrators will also be allowed to make reasonable accommodations for students to use phones for educational purposes.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) is the school superintendent in East Newark, where students have had to surrender their cellphones during the school day for the last five years.
“I’ve heard it from students about the state, that even though it’s hard to let go of the device, that they are thankful for the time that they have in school that they don’t have to worry about it anymore. That they don’t have to compete for the attention. That they don’t have to compete with news of what’s happening in the moment,” Bagolie said.
About 16 states have approved “bell-to-bell” cellphone bans in classrooms.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office at noon on Jan. 20, commended Murphy for signing the bill. During her campaign for governor, Sherrill also said she wanted to limit phones in schools.
“Our young people are facing a mental health crisis — but, we all know that when children put the screens down, their mental health and academic results improve,” Sherrill said in a statement. “I look forward to implementing this important legislation and continuing to make progress on kids’ online safety and holding Big Tech accountable for the content they push toward our kids.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nonpartisan U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn raised $762,000 in the last quarter of 2025, bringing his campaign total for last year to more than $2 million, his team told the Examiner. 
While fundraising reports are still being finalized with the Federal Election Commission, Osborn had 11,857 individual donors in the last quarter, with an average contribution of roughly $37, the campaign says. The Osborn camp says the numbers show the former labor leader is running a “stronger campaign” than his closer-than-expected loss to U.S. Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024. 
Osborn, who has said he is not accepting donations from corporate political action committees but not from union PACs, said his campaign is being “backed by working-class people.” 
Osborn is currently in a heated campaign against Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. Osborn gained national attention for his 2024 bid against Fischer, who beat him by six percentage points in a state where Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly 2 to 1, and nonpartisans make up a growing share of the electorate.

“Pete Ricketts is a billionaire whose war chest will be bankrolled by deep-pocketed corporate interests,” Osborn said. “We have always known that. We have the people behind us, we will always outwork him, and that’s why we will win this U.S. Senate seat.”

Ricketts and his team are trying to paint Osborn as a “fake independent,” pointing to his having received donations and support from Democrats and using fundraising infrastructure often used by Democrats. They’ve also criticized him for paying himself and his wife using campaign funds, which is legal but often comes at a political price.
Will Coup, Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said Osborn is releasing his topline numbers to “avoid scrutiny of what’s actually in his report.”
“Did Osborn continue self-dealing by paying thousands of dollars to a shell company owned by his wife? Did he accept even more funding from Elizabeth Warren and members of the Soros family?” Coup said. “Once again, Fake Dan Osborn is trying to hide his self-dealing, his donors, and his liberal policies from Nebraskans.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Mike Foley is seeking another four-year term as Nebraska auditor of public accounts, embracing a job designed to help root out fraud, inefficiency and misuse of government resources.
At 71, Foley’s political career in Nebraska has spanned a quarter century, starting as a state senator representing south Lincoln in 2001. In the Legislature, he was a social conservative who often emphasized his opposition to abortion. He was also criticized by some for pressing his faith into public positions.
Nebraska State Auditor’s Office. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
After six years making laws, the Republican won back-to-back terms as state auditor. He ran for governor in the 2014 election and lost in the primary to Pete Ricketts, who later named Foley as his running mate, which led to an eight-year stint as lieutenant governor.
Foley then chose to take another shot at the auditor’s post and voters returned him to the office in 2023. After filing paperwork this week for what would be a fourth term as auditor, though not all consecutive, Foley told the Nebraska Examiner he hadn’t seriously considered any other job.
“I enjoy this work. It’s a good fit for me,” he said. “We have a great team and I think we’re making a difference.”
The auditor provides independent investigations of financial activities of state and local governments. Oversight extends to about 2,700 entities and agencies, Foley said. Findings go to policymakers and taxpayers via reports and Internet-based budget and audit databases.
Foley earned his undergraduate degree from State University of New York at Brockport and a master’s degree from Michigan State University.
Before moving to Nebraska, Foley lived two decades in Washington D.C., where he was director of financial analysis for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. He and his wife Susan have six children and four grandchildren.
Foley said he aims to be impartial and “calls it as I see it,” regardless of who is involved.
“I wasn’t hired to look the other way when I find problems,” he said.

Luckert is retiring from the state's highest court. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Justice Eric Rosen formally stepped into the job of chief justice Thursday by framing the delicate work of the state’s highest court as a crucial public service and proclaiming the citizenry’s diversity of perspective strengthened the rule of law rather than challenged it.
Rosen, who joined the Supreme Court in 2005 after serving a dozen years as a Shawnee County District Court judge, said the rule of law endured not because it was rigid but because its principles could be applied fairly in response to the blended reality of people.
“Over the last 20 years, I have learned that the role of this court is both modest and profound,” he said. “We do not make public policy nor do we do we chase public approval. The oath I swore to you today commands our duty is to interpret and apply the law faithfully, to safeguard constitutional privileges and principles and ensure that justice is administered without fear or favor.”
Rosen said the Supreme Court had to be mindful that the court’s decisions impact the lives of 3 million Kansans and shaped public trust in the judicial branch.
“It is a lived reality that people who come before our courts seek fairness and justice,” Rosen said. “It is complemented by a broader richness of viewpoints and backgrounds that strengthens public trust and deepens our understanding of the law’s impact.”
Rosen was the first Jewish person appointed a district court judge in Kansas and the first in state history to serve on the Supreme Court. He also became Kansas’ first Jewish chief justice. He said he was mindful that being Jewish set him apart in ways that at times were isolating and limiting, but reaching each personal legal milestone wasn’t about distinction for its own sake.
“Equal justice under the law is not self-executed. It requires vigilance. It requires humility and a continued commitment to ensuring that our institutions truly belong to everyone they serve,” Rosen said.
Rosen transitioned to acting chief justice in October after Chief Justice Marla Luckert suffered a stroke. On Jan. 1, Rosen assumed the role of chief justice upon Luckert’s resignation from the position. Rosen moved into the job because of a provision of the Kansas Constitution reserving that role for the justice with the most continuous years of service to the court.
Rosen praised Luckert’s tenure as chief justice and told an audience of about 225 people in the Kansas Judicial Center that he appreciated her steady leadership, integrity and commitment to fairness.
He said the Supreme Court had a duty to honor Luckert’s adherence to principles of thoughtful deliberation, respect for different views and an understanding that justice wasn’t static but something that must be tended with care.
“It’s a bittersweet moment for me to embrace my new charge while preparing to wish a close professional colleague and friend a wonderful, well-earned retirement,” Rosen said.
Luckert, who plans to soon retire from the Supreme Court, said she had worked with Rosen for three decades in the district and appellate courts and recognized he “guarded the principles of fair and equal justice for all litigants.” She said people appearing before Rosen were treated with dignity and assured their disputes would be resolved impartially.
Libby Rosen, the chief justice’s wife, introduced her husband and recalled his pursuit of a dream to leave a career as a school social worker to become a lawyer. He went to law school part-time while raising a family, which offered him important lessons in the precision of words. She recalled Rosen asked his 3-year-old son, who was eating an apple, if he could have a bite.
“Eric paused for a second and went over and bit his father,” she said.
Libby Rosen said that after more than 50 years together the state’s chief justice had shown he was a “calm, fair and reasoned partner as long as it didn’t concern technology.”
She said the couple recently began a daily habit of playing Wordle. She said her skills as a nurse led her to finish faster than her husband. The chief justice, however, was deliberative and considered all angles before advancing in each stage of the game, she said.
“He takes much longer to do it, but he gets it right in fewer tries,” Libby Rosen said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Luckert-and-Rosen-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

A key Senate committee on Thursday advanced four bills that would give communities more leeway to soften the blow of sudden tax increases. Two of the bills are authored by senators representing Boston who have drawn Wu’s ire for not backing her approach.
The bills are set for a vote on Thursday, January 15, according to a Senate official, as is another measure that would require ballot question committees to more frequently disclose their fundraising and spending.
The sudden movement of the tax bills sets the stage for another round of finger-pointing and political elbowing about the growing burden of residential property taxes in the state’s capital.
As homeowners faced a series of steep increases, Wu tried on several occasions to secure permission from Beacon Hill to temporarily shift some of the burden to businesses. Her plan had buy-in from the House, but it never gained traction in the Senate and then became a vector for renewed cross-branch tension.
After Wu made her latest ill-fated pitch in December, Senate leaders instead began to move a pair of bills from Sen. Nick Collins of South Boston and Sen. Will Brownsberger of Belmont, whose district also includes part of Boston, taking aim at local property-tax issues.
One of those bills that earned the Senate Ways and Means Committee’s approval Thursday would allow communities to create a “tax shock credit,” designed to ease the impact when a residential property tax levy is set to increase more than 10 percent in a single year. Officials say the relief would be targeted to “the most vulnerable taxpayers,” including taxpayers who have a child 6 years old or younger residing at the home in question, people 65 years or older who own and occupy their homes, and households where a member is enrolled in MassHealth.
The other bill would launch an opt-in rebate program providing an added credit to taxpayers who received the residential tax exemption in the prior year for an owner-occupied property.
Senate President Karen Spilka said the slate ready for action, which also includes two others bills that deal with senior property tax deferrals and exemptions, “puts more tools into the toolboxes of municipalities across the state to give a break to the taxpayers most in need.”
Fueled in large part by a post-pandemic shift to remote work, commercial property values in Boston have plummeted in recent years. That in turn has forced more of the city’s property tax burden onto homeowners, who are alreadystaring down major increases to tax bills that arrive in January.
Even with a Senate vote set for next week, it’s unclear when or even whether the new relief measures will become law. House leaders remain frustrated with the approach the Senate took to Wu’s plan, and they appear skeptical about the Brownsberger-Collins alternatives.
Asked last month if the House had any interest in taking up those Senate’s bills, House Speaker Ron Mariano — who at the time was perched near a third-floor ledge in the State House — quipped, “This may cause me to jump.”
The Senate was “critical of the mayor not giving out enough notice” ahead of her latest tax-shift proposal, Mariano said, according to State House News Service. “These guys pulled these bills right out of their back pocket. So I think that we need to understand what their bills do.”
The dust-up is still producing political fallout. Wu last month called out Collins for not supporting her prior version of the tax-shift plan. Meanwhile, Daniel Lander, a senior policy adviser to Wu, in December launched a Democratic primary challenge against Brownsberger.
While Wu has not weighed in on the race, Lander cited Brownsberger’s opposition to the mayor’s tax plan as a reason he decided to run, according to the Dorchester Reporter.
The 2026 elections are also a key theme in the other major bill the Senate teed up for a vote next week.
That proposal, originally filed by Sen. Sal DiDomenico of Everett, would require campaigns pushing statewide ballot questions to submit reports at least once per month, with a bit more frequency closer to the election.
Current law is notoriously lax when it comes to financial disclosures for ballot questions, whose backers and opponents regularly spend millions or tens of millions of dollars trying to sway voters on impactful policy changes.
In 2026, ballot question campaigns do not need to file their next reports until September, allowing influential and well-funded groups to obscure how much money they are pumping into their efforts — and who their backers are — until just a couple of months before the election.
Lawmakers are growing increasingly skeptical of the ballot question process, which is often used by advocates as political leverage on issues that the Legislature does not want to touch.
As many as 12 statewide questions remain in the running to appear before voters this fall, which would smash the previous record of nine questions in a single election. They cover a wide range of thorny topics, such as whether to cut the state’s income tax rate, impose a strict cap on rents across Massachusetts, and repeal the decade-old voter authorization for recreational marijuana.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-03_transit_worker_bill_signing_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican legislative leaders agreed to pay former Emporia State University president Ken Hush $50,000 to spearhead their efforts to slash spending at public universities.
The five Republican members of the Legislative Coordinating Council, over objections from the panel’s two Democrats, approved a contract Thursday to pay Hush $10,000 per month for five months to be a consultant to the Legislature on higher education budgets. The committee members didn’t mention Hush by name while discussing the deal, but Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, confirmed it was Hush after the meeting.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said Hush would be tasked with finding “efficiencies” in university budgets while the Legislature works to cut annual state spending by $200 million.
Hush retired last month after leading ESU for more than three years. As president, he fired tenured professors without due process and eliminated and added programs without explanation. The so-called “ESU model” cratered student enrollment and required a pair of $9 million bailouts from the Legislature. An investigation by the American Association of University Professors concluded he was unfit to lead.
Hawkins — Hush’s fraternity brother in the early 1980s at ESU — praised Hush’s leadership at ESU during the Thursday meeting.
“He has intimate insight into the higher ed budget arena, and certainly, as everybody knows, we have to be very careful and prudent with the dollars in our budget,” Hawkins said.
The Kansas Board of Regents already initiated plans to evaluate programs and faculty members at the state’s six public universities, and dismiss those who fail to meet expectations. In a brief exchange with reporters, Masterson said the effort was “helpful,” but that he wasn’t sure if it would go far enough. He supported the contract with Hush.
“It’s just valuable to have somebody who’s run a university be able to consult you on some of that, because those are vast budgets with multiple revenue sources,” Masterson said. “It’s gonna be well worth a few dollars spent. And” — he paused to bump this reporter’s shoulder — “we didn’t have a special session this year.”
The comment was in reference to GOP leaders’ failed plans to hold a special session in November 2025 to try to gerrymander U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, out of office. The LCC had allotted $460,000 to fund the special session.
Rep. Blake Carpenter, right, says he has found $100 million in questionable spending by state universities. House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard listens during a Jan. 8, 2026, meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Rep. Blake Carpenter, R-Derby, said he supported the move to hire Hush because he and his staff already identified $100 million in what he considered to be “questionable spending” by universities. He said their findings included $75,000 “in travel reimbursements to a vanilla bean manufacturing tour guide in Africa,” $96,000 “to a nutritionist guru specializing in vegan cookbooks,” and $111,000 “to a social justice head-hunting firm specializing in placing executives into leadership positions and nonprofits.”
“So I think that if we’re able to find about $100 million just on our own over the interim with my staff and I looking through these line items, then I think it makes a lot of sense for us to hire an executive that has run one of these universities,” Carpenter said. “They know how they operate, and they can give specific details as to where and how we can be more efficient with these higher education systems. And I think the $100 million at this point is scratching the surface, and we need to continue to dig.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, both Lenexa Democrats, questioned whether Hush’s work would duplicate the work of the Legislature’s existing budget analysts and research staff.
Sykes also questioned the transparency of handing a costly, no-bid contract to an unnamed consultant without making the plan public in advance of Thursday’s meeting.
“I find it interesting with all the talk we have about finding efficiency in government, and I think we keep growing government, honestly,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1080325-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

The airline’s decision to end the immigration charters was part of a broader financial restructuring that the company unveiled earlier in the week.
Activists in Maryland last summer and fall pressured the state government to end its contract with Avelo at BWI, in protest of the ICE deportation flights taking place across the country and President Donald Trump’s immigration policies more generally. Maryland groups targeting Avelo collected thousands of petition signatures, urging Gov. Wes Moore (D) to cancel the state’s contract with the airline.
Similar protests have been taking place all over the country, in cities where Avelo runs flights.
But the Moore administration, which has criticized Trump’s immigration policies, asserted that the state had no power over any ICE flights out of BWI and did not seek to end its contract with Avelo.
Avelo and Maryland signed a deal in 2022 for the carrier to run a limited number of flights to and from other U.S. cities in and out of BWI, the state-owned airport. The contract enables the state or the airline to walk away with 30 days’ notice.
Even if Maryland had ended its arrangement with Avelo for commercial flights at BWI, that would not have prevented Avelo or other carriers from running detainee flights out of the airport.

The data, released by the Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday, shows a drop of over 7% in positive influenza cases and 40 fewer hospitalizations during the week of Dec. 28, which is the most recently available data.
The drop followed a spike in positive flu cases and hospitalizations over the Christmas holiday week. 
Positive cases hit a peak of nearly 22% positivity during the week of Dec. 21, according to a flu data dashboard operated by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Hospitalizations also peaked that week, reaching 165, according to the dashboard. 
Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said one week of fluctuation is too early to say if cases are truly decreasing. 
Rankin said this week’s dip could be due to a shift in the number of people visiting the doctor or a change in provider reporting with offices having altered hours during the holidays. 
“We have observed an increase in the influenza percent positivity rate in many areas of the state, along with many states across the country,” Rankin said. “This is what we would expect to see this time of year, being in the middle of respiratory season.”
Nationally, the most recent CDC data shows flu cases are elevated and the number of cases continues to increase in most states.
A majority of Oklahoma’s confirmed positive flu cases are a subset of Influenza A strain. Known as the H3N2 subtype, health officials have said the strain is more resistant to the flu shot. 
Rankin said it isn’t too late to get the flu shot. 
“We would encourage individuals to speak with their trusted health care provider to determine if the flu shot is right for them and to bring any concerns or questions they may have to them,” she said in a statement. “Even if the flu shot is not a perfect match to the strain circulating, it can still help to reduce the severity of illness someone may get from the flu.”
The flu dashboard is updated every Thursday, excluding state holidays, using data from the previous Sunday through Saturday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/advocates-federal-cutbacks-could-cost-ct-nearly-1-billion/,"Connecticut Voices for Children projects the impending financial hit at nearly $1 billion, more than double the $500 million emergency fund.","For the first time since Congress and President Donald Trump slashed health care and nutrition assistance last July, Connecticut legislators heard a projection of how much the state stands to lose next fiscal year.
It wasn’t pretty.
Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven-based policy group, used its 25th annual Tax and Budget Forum Thursday to project the impending financial hit at nearly $1 billion, more than double the $500 million emergency fund legislators created in special session to offset vanishing aid from Washington.
The progressive research organization also offered numerous options to mitigate forces it says are pushing thousands of Connecticut residents into poverty or farther below subsistence levels.
The General Assembly could pump hundreds of millions into health care and food assistance by boosting taxes on the wealthy households that are chief beneficiaries of new federal tax cuts financed with human service program cuts, the organization reported.
But, given 2026 is a state election year and tax hikes are unpopular, lawmakers and Gov. Ned Lamont also could achieve similar results by curbing aggressive state savings policies and by working harder to collect the nearly $4 billion in unpaid taxes Connecticut misses out on annually.
“The income and wealth divides are widening by the day, and it’s on full display when some of the most powerful people and corporations are profiting … while many of our neighbors have no choice but to visit a food pantry to feed their families,” Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices, said to open the online forum.
General Assembly must solve next CT budget in February
Since Trump and the GOP-led Congress ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to various human service programs over the next decade to finance $4.5 trillion in tax relief, Connecticut officials have been waiting to learn how big the local hit would be.
Lamont’s budget staff was supposed to issue projections this fall but did not do so, saying it should wait until after Congress resolves the next federal budget — something that still hasn’t happened.
But the General Assembly must begin revising state finances for the 2026-27 fiscal year when its next regular session starts on Feb. 4. State lawmakers have been bracing for the worst.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who has pressed the Lamont administration repeatedly for its analysis of the congressional fiscal mega-bill, said the Connecticut Voices’ tally seems on the mark.
That $1 billion gap reflects not only cuts to Medicaid and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, but also vanishing federal tax assistance to families that purchase health insurance offered through the state exchange.
Connecticut Voices’ analysts assume about 150,000 state residents would lose health insurance, either because policies on the exchange have become unaffordable or due to cuts in federal Medicaid funding.
And though the state Department of Social Services estimated as many as 36,000 residents here would become ineligible for SNAP benefits by March 31 because of new work requirements and other rules changes Congress ordered in July, other changes will continue to tighten the program over the coming decade. By the early 2030s, Connecticut Voices estimates those removed from the program here will approach 58,000.
Considering both cuts to human service programs and federal tax relief, the poorest 20% of households are estimated to lose more than $1,600, on average, in annual resources, while the richest 10% are projected to gain more than $9,200, Connecticut Voices’ analysts project.
The General Assembly this fall set aside $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to backfill vanishing federal aid in certain human service programs. Lamont already has directed $168 million from that fund to assist food pantries, Planned Parenthood and programs to combat homelessness. The administration also dedicated another $70 million to mitigate cutbacks in federal assistance for health insurance premiums.
Lamont’s direct control over the $500 million ends when the General Assembly reconvenes Feb. 4, but Ritter said he expects lawmakers will continue working with the governor to spend the rest of those funds, and possibly more, to soften the harshest cuts to human service programs.
“We have, I think, a responsibility to do the best we can to help our residents,” the speaker said, adding he remains hopeful that if Democrats gain control of at least one chamber of Congress during the November 2026 elections, some of the federal budget policies can be reversed.
Report: Poverty was growing in CT before federal cuts
Connecticut Voices argues in its report that Connecticut’s middle class had been slipping closer to poverty — and its poor falling even further — well before last July.
Over the past three years, the share of Connecticut residents living in or near poverty ticked up from 21.8% to 22.8%, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure, a metric that considers not only household income and expenses but also public assistance benefits.
That is aligned with findings reported last September by the United Way of Connecticut, which found a record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget in 2023.
“If the state does not act, and holding all other factors constant, the new federal policies will lead to even more low- and middle-income households struggling to make ends meet and higher poverty rates,” Connecticut Voices’ research and policy director, Patrick O’Brien, wrote in his report for the forum.
Connecticut is home to some of the most extreme income and wealth inequality in the country.
The top 1% of households nationally, or those who earn more than $730,000 per year according to CNBC, have an average income of $2.27 million per year, about 127 times the average earnings of the poorest 20%, which is $17,870, O’Brien said.  
But in Connecticut the top 1% enjoy a much wider gap, averaging $3.66 million in yearly income or almost 183 times that of the $20,050 earned by the poorest 20%. 
CT could tax the rich – or save less – to help poor and middle class
Given that taxpayers with incomes topping $500,000 per year are slated to receive one-third of the entire federal tax break — which is paid for, in part, with deep cuts to assistance programs — Connecticut Voices’ officials repeated recommendations they’ve made in several recent forums for state tax hikes on some the highest earners.
Adding or adjusting business tax surcharges could raise as much as $110 million per year.
Similarly, placing a surcharge on the capital gains-related earnings of households with overall income that exceeds $500,000 per year would generate $235 million.
Raising the effective tax rate on Connecticut’s largest estates could collect up to an extra $70 million.
And if state officials don’t want to talk tax hikes while running for reelection this year, there are other ways to raise funds, O’Brien noted.
The state has used an aggressive series of budget caps to force unprecedented surpluses since 2017. Unspent dollars have averaged more than $1.8 billion annually over the last eight years, a huge total that represents 8% to 9% of the General Fund. One cap alone that restricts legislators’ ability to spend certain income and business tax receipts has captured an average of $1.5 billion per year.
Connecticut has used those dollars to bolster its reserves and whittle down its pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office.
Many Democrats in the legislature have criticized the caps in recent years, arguing they force excessive surpluses and draw needed funds from health care, education, municipal aid and other core programs.
Connecticut Voices’ analysts say moving between $925 million or more from this savings program and into the budget would eliminate the need for any tax hikes.
They also note the state projects a $3.7 billion annual “tax gap” that reflects the difference between what is owed and collected. If Connecticut were to increase auditing staff sufficient to reduce that gap by even 10%, it would provide almost $400 million extra annually to mitigate losses in federal aid.
But minority Republicans in the General Assembly, as well as many moderate Democrats, are expected to fight many of these proposals.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Thursday that his caucus still favors a major state income tax cut aimed solely at Connecticut’s middle class. The House GOP in October pitched increasing an income tax credit that offsets local property tax bills by as much as $700 per filer.
But Candelora said Republicans aren’t looking to boost taxes on any households or businesses at this time and added Connecticut officials should try to find efficiencies in the existing state budget if they want to identify money to offset federal cutbacks to human service programs.
Lamont, a moderate Democrat, has steadfastly opposed increasing taxes on Connecticut’s wealthy, including finance investments in social programs, arguing that doing so would prompt higher earners to flee the state.
The governor also has been wary about changing any of Connecticut’s budget caps, despite complaints from his fellow Democrats in the legislature.
Lamont did sign the first major state income tax rate cut into law three years ago, which gave middle class families about $300 per year. And his budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, noted the governor recently secured legislative approval for a new endowment to dramatically expand affordable child care, largely by using state surplus dollars.
Collibee didn’t comment on specific proposals from Connecticut Voices but added that “Gov. Lamont is eager to hear any thoughtful ideas that can help make life more affordable for Connecticut families.”
Byrne said that “affordability” is a popular buzz word “that politicians feel compelled to say,” adding that it’s unclear which households’ budgets leaders are trying to assist.
“While the state may not have created the chaos we’re experiencing, it owns it now,” Byrne added. “And so the choices made by elected [state officials] will determine whether federal harms are made worse or mitigated.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0203_SR_HousingPolicy051-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468
,DC,2026-01-08 22:19:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-backs-extension-health-insurance-subsidies-after-dems-force-vote,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House approved a bipartisan bill Thursday to resurrect the enhanced tax credits that expired at the end of last year for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.The 230-196 vote sends the legislation to the Senate, where Republican leadership is unlikely to put it on the floor without considerable changes, which a bipartisan group of senators appears close to finalizing. Seventeen Republicans voted with every Democrat to pass the bill. House GOP leaders didn’t want to bring the bill up in their chamber, but a handful of their own members signed a discharge petition in December, forcing the vote amid rising health care costs. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern said during floor debate on Wednesday evening “it’s about damn time” the chamber took up a bill to address the now-expired tax credits, arguing lawmakers have a “moral obligation to act” to help people afford health insurance.“This Congress musters up the will to spend trillions of dollars on tax breaks for billionaires and to send the Pentagon billions of dollars more than they even asked for. And the administration came up with tens of billions of dollars to bail out Argentina, for God’s sake,” McGovern said. “But somehow helping moms and dads, grandparents and kids afford trips to the doctor is a step too far for this Republican leadership.”New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler said he only backed the bill after Republican leaders declined to bring up a bipartisan two-year compromise bill he helped negotiate last year. “I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Lawler said. Republicans and Democrats, he said, agree that the country’s health care system is in need of a serious overhaul. He called on his colleagues to find solutions to the bigger, more structural issues. “Enough of the blame game on both sides,” Lawler said. “Let’s focus on actually delivering affordable health care for Americans.”Prolonged fight over ACA tax credits Democrats originally established the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits during the coronavirus pandemic in an attempt to get more people health insurance coverage. They set the subsidies to expire at the end of 2025.The debate over the sunset date simmered in the background for much of last year but surged to the forefront in October after Democrats shut down the government and repeatedly demanded GOP leaders negotiate an extension to the expiring enhanced tax credits.The shutdown ended in mid-November after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to give Democrats a vote on a health care bill of their choosing in December. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ultimately decided to bring up a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits without any changes, but it failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance.A proposal from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, both Republicans, that would have provided funding through Health Savings Accounts for some ACA marketplace enrollees during 2026 and 2027 also failed to move toward final passage. A House Republican health care bill passed that chamber last month, but doesn’t have the bipartisan support to move through the Senate and become law. Senate problemsThune said Tuesday any renewal of the enhanced ACA marketplace subsidies would need reforms to move through that chamber.The bill, he said, would need to set income limits on who qualifies for the enhanced tax credit and eliminate ACA health insurance plans that have $0 premiums, a feature Republicans allege allowed insurance companies to enroll people without their knowledge to receive the subsidy. “And then the second component would be some sort of a bridge to (Health Savings Accounts). An expansion of HSAs so that you're getting more money into the pockets of the American people, the patients, if you will, the consumers, as opposed to insurance companies,” Thune said. “And then finally you've got to deal with the Hyde issue.”The Hyde Amendment has been a feature of government spending bills for decades, preventing federal dollars from going to abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape, or incest, or threatens the woman’s life. Republicans want the prohibition to apply to all ACA marketplace health insurance plans without any way for Americans to pay for the coverage themselves, the way they do now. Democrats have rejected the change as a non-starter that would restrict abortion access in blue states. ‘Be a little flexible on Hyde,’ says TrumpPresident Donald Trump waded into that debate this week, telling House Republicans during a policy retreat at the Kennedy Center they must be “flexible” about the Hyde Amendment in order to broker a health care deal that can reach his desk. ""You have to be a little flexible on Hyde. You know that. You’ve got to be a little flexible,” Trump said. “You’ve got to work something. You’ve got to use ingenuity. You’ve got to work. We’re all big fans of everything, but you’ve got to have flexibility.""Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser rebuked Trump for the comment, writing in a statement that to “suggest Republicans should be ‘flexible’ is an abandonment of this decades-long commitment. If Republicans abandon Hyde, they are sure to lose this November.”States have a patchwork of laws addressing abortion coverage in ACA  marketplace health insurance plans, with 25 prohibiting coverage with certain exceptions and 12 requiring abortion coverage, according to analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.“In states that do not bar coverage of abortions on plans available through the Marketplace, insurers may offer a plan that covers abortions beyond the permissible Hyde amendment situations when the pregnancy is a result of rape, or incest or the pregnant person’s life is endangered, but this coverage cannot be paid with federal dollars.”Any ACA marketplace health insurance plan that offers abortion coverage in circumstances outside those three exceptions must charge each enrollee $1 for that coverage, according to KFF.Behind the scenes in the SenateA bipartisan group of senators has been talking behind the scenes for months about how to extend the ACA marketplace subsidies with changes. Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno said Thursday he expects the group, which has agreed on a “framework,” to release a bill next week, though he cautioned that’s just one small step. “We have agreement that we think we have a skeleton of a deal. But it's all fun and games until you have it on paper in a bill form,” Moreno said. “So we have to do that. And then we have to go sell the heck out of it to our conference. And again, look, this is politics. There's people on both sides that want this to fail. So we have to get past that massive mountain.”

Moreno said the tentative plan is to revive the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credit for another two years with modifications.The bill would also: Extend open enrollment for this year until March 1.Cap the enhanced subsidy for people making under 700% of the federal poverty level, or about $109,550 in annual income for one person, according to the guidelines for 2025.Require people eligible for the enhanced tax credit to pay at least $5 per month or $60 per year for their health insurance to ensure the enrollee knows about their coverage.Fine insurance companies $1,000 for “deliberately causing fraud, meaning signing someone up without their consent.”ACA marketplace enrollees eligible for the enhanced tax credit would have a choice in 2027 to either keep the lower premium that stems from the health insurance company receiving the subsidy, or move to a Health Savings Account where they would receive the money from the government. “The final piece, which I think is the biggest sweetener to the whole deal, is putting back in place cost-sharing reduction payments, which, according to (the Congressional Budget Office), reduce premiums for everybody in the exchange by 11% and save the federal government money,” Moreno said, later clarifying that would happen in 2027.  There is not yet a final proposal regarding how ACA marketplace plans handle abortion coverage in states where it's allowed, he said. The handshake agreement, Moreno said, is intended to give Congress time to overhaul the bigger issues facing the country’s health insurance and health care systems in a way that reduces costs.Gang of negotiatorsMoreno said the core group of negotiators, which he nicknamed the EPTCOG gang on his text chain, includes six Democrats and five of his Republican Senate colleagues. There are 24 senators total in the “extended OG” gang. Moreno believes one of his advantages in the negotiations is that he hasn’t been around the Senate that long, having just been elected in 2024. He said senators are also handling the details themselves, instead of deferring much of the work to staff. “This has been principals only. We don't even allow staff in meetings,” Moreno said. “And the idea is if we can't work it out, there's really no point in tasking this with staff.”New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the negotiators, said Wednesday she wasn’t aware of a deadline for the negotiators to release a bill. She also brushed aside the possibility of changes to how the ACA handles abortion coverage. “There is no need to come to a compromise because it's already been dealt with in the Affordable Care Act,” Shaheen said. “There is very specific language on how it is dealt with. And I think that applies to whatever happens with the Affordable Care Act.”Shaheen said Thursday the House vote “provides momentum” for Senate negotiators.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

The No. 2 Republican in the Vermont House, Rep. Casey Toof of St. Albans Town, will resign his seat next week. Toof has served as assistant minority leader since 2023 and has represented his Franklin County town in the chamber since 2019.
The 40-year-old said he’s leaving the House after starting a new job in November as town manager of St. Albans Town. He and his wife also had a third child last July, he said; the combination of the job’s workload, and a larger family, has meant he’s had less time to devote to legislating.
“Working five minutes from home is a lot easier for me to justify than driving to Montpelier every day,” he said Thursday.

Toof has spent his entire tenure assigned to the House Education Committee. Last year, he was one of the voices pushing Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s priorities during the fierce debate over lawmakers’ sweeping education reform plan, Act 73. Toof said the fact that many of the law’s key provisions are still to be hashed out made his decision to leave the Statehouse this year more difficult.
Toof’s resignation does not take effect until Jan. 16, but House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, has already moved him off the education committee. She replaced him with another representative, Milton GOP Rep. Leland Morgan, on Tuesday. Toof was moved, somewhat ceremonially, to the House Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry Committee.
Toof said the shuffling, which he supported, would allow Morgan to participate in some of the education panel’s introductory hearings this week focused on Act 73 and its next steps.
Scott has not yet named Toof’s replacement. Toof’s House leadership role has already been filled, however, by Rep. Mark Higley, R-Lowell, who previously served as second assistant minority leader, Higley said Thursday.
Rep. Tom Burditt, R-Rutland, now has Higley’s old job, Higley said.
In addition to serving in the House, Toof managed Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers’ winning campaign for that office in 2024.
Toof is set to be the fourth House member to resign since the end of the 2025 session in June. Jim Harrison, a Chittenden Republican, stepped down Tuesday; Heather Surprenant, a Barnard Democrat, resigned in September; and Mari Cordes, a Bristol Democrat, resigned in June.

Kelly Ayotte speaks at the Executive Council meeting on Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire child care providers are being urged not to panic by state officials and lawmakers as news spreads that the Trump administration froze federal child care subsidies in five Democratic states earlier this week. 
At an Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, Councilor Joseph Kenney of Wakefield questioned Lori Weaver, commissioner for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, for an update on the status of the state’s federal funding for child care, despite it not being on the agenda. 
“We have not had any of our child care [funding] cut,” Weaver said. “There’s a lot of media out there to do about Minnesota, and there’s been talk of that, but we are still doing business as usual right now. We have no official word, no notice.” 
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced a rule-change proposal for the Child Care Development Fund, the primary source of federal child care funding in New Hampshire. 
If approved, the proposal would allow states to change how payments to child care programs are calculated, from the number of children enrolled to the number of children in attendance each day or week. It would also remove the requirement for states to pay child care providers upfront for care subsidies and reinstate parent-directed vouchers. 
Karen Hebert, director of the division of economic stability, told the council that the department “hasn’t had any changes” to its payment processes and that the proposal could take “weeks or months” to be approved. 
She said if the proposal gets approved, the state Department of Health and Human Services “would then take whatever steps we need to comply with those changes.” 
Providers have said that a change in how payments are distributed could be costly for programs and the families they serve. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte reaffirmed the importance of the Child Care Scholarship Program, which is funded by the Child Care Development Fund, after the council meeting. 
“I can tell you, the Child Care Scholarship Program is really important to me,” Ayotte said. “We have federal money, but also often have some state portion. So we tend to look at things very carefully.” 
Ayotte also said she and Weaver discuss fraud “all the time,” and that New Hampshire “is not Minnesota.” 
Providers were also briefed directly about what is going on at the federal level.
In a meeting with child care providers on Thursday, Jotham Spreeman, administrator of operators at the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start, aimed to clear up “panic” and “concern.” 
“The three main things to keep track of is to continue to maintain those accurate records like you probably already are, comply with any documentation requests with licensing or from [the department], and then prepare in case we [need] extra information,” Spreeman said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1075254-Ayotte-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Six victim advocacy groups announced Thursday a new initiative to help the public better protect kids in response to several high-profile cases of child abuse and sex trafficking that dominated headlines in 2025.
Advocates said the new organization, called the North Dakota HOPE Project, was prompted by events like the criminal conviction of former state Sen. Ray Holmberg, who last March was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a child sex crime.
“For many survivors, 2025 felt like a year of nonstop retraumatization,” Stacy Schaffer, executive director of the 31:8 Project, said in a statement announcing the project. “This initiative is about reminding survivors that help exists — and reminding communities that exploitation is preventable.”

The acronym HOPE stands for healing, outreach, prevention and empowerment.
Greg Kasowski, executive director of the Children’s Advocacy Centers of North Dakota, said his organization served more than 3,000 children and families in 2025. About 1,000 children were “suspected of being abused or interviewed by a forensic interviewer,” he said at a Thursday press conference.
“Each one of those cases could have — should have — been prevented,” he said.
Kasowski called on North Dakotans to learn the signs of sex trafficking and how to respond appropriately.
“We have some opportunities today to make 2026 a year where we stop being reactive, and start being proactive,” he said.
To help educate the public, HOPE Project is hosting a six-part free webinar series that focuses on human trafficking awareness and child online safety.
The first webinar takes place Jan. 13 at 1 p.m. To register, visit the North Dakota HOPE Project’s website.
During the press conference, advocates also called attention to the help available to survivors of abuse, including medical services, shelters and other support. A list of resources is also available on the group’s website.
State program expands services to domestic violence victims

Nikki, a sex trafficking survivor who works on the 31:8 Project’s Survivor Advocacy Committee, said that trafficking thrives in secrecy. 
“I want people to understand that human trafficking is not rare,” she said during the press conference. “I am just one survivor among many.”
Nikki asked to be identified only by first name. The Monitor does not identify victims of sex crimes.
Nikki said survivors like her need “safety, support and understanding.”
“By learning the signs, starting conversations and supporting prevention and survivor centered services we can help ensure that no one has to face exploitation alone,” she said.
Nikki said she’s been able to heal thanks to resources offered by organizations like the ones involved in the North Dakota HOPE Project. She’s now pursuing her bachelor’s degree in social work, she said.
Advocates on Thursday applauded a new law adopted by the 2025 Legislature that requires all sixth, 10th and 12th graders in public schools to undergo education about human trafficking awareness and prevention.
“It is meant to complement, not replace, the broader accountability that we are talking about today,” said Mark Heinert, executive director of Youthworks. 
He noted the need for more training geared toward adults.
 “Youth education is strongest when it’s paired with adults who are paying attention,” Heinert said.
The six organizations working together on the North Dakota HOPE Project are the 31:8 Project, Central Dakota Forensic Nurse Examiners, Children’s Advocacy Centers of North Dakota, North Dakota Domestic & Sexual Violence Coalition, Families Flourish ND and Youthworks.
Sen. Dick Dever, a Bismarck Republican who serves on the Legislature’s Protection and Victim Services Committee, attended the event. The committee this interim session is studying topics including state laws related to crimes against children and human trafficking, and current services available to survivors.
Dever said he’d “like to do whatever we can” to further support organizations like the North Dakota HOPE Project. He noted that in recent years the Legislature has taken steps including establishing the Human Trafficking Commission under the Attorney General’s Office in 2015.

The attorney for a Rutland County man facing a murder charge in a fatal crash that killed an officer is asking a judge to reconsider an order holding his client without bail, citing an internal affairs report that strongly criticizes the actions of police leading to the deadly chase.
David Sleigh, a lawyer for 22-year-old Tate Rheaume, in recent court filings based his request largely on an internal affairs report made public in November. The report noted policy violations by Rutland City officers in the pursuit that led to the death of a fellow officer, 19-year-old Jessica Ebbighausen.
The internal affairs report became public through a court filing by Sleigh in the case against Rheaume, who is facing an aggravated murder charge in the death of Ebbighausen during the high-speed Rutland chase in July 2023.

Sleigh wrote in filings that he learned of the internal affairs investigation conducted by a city police commander through depositions of officers in the case and then subpoenaed it from the city police department.
The internal report stated that Ebbighausen’s death was “preventable” if officers had followed the proper procedures. The policy violations, according to the report, ranged from not having the proper authority to initiate the pursuit to not following procedures while the chase was underway.
“(I)t is now beyond dispute that the initiation and conduct of the pursuit leading to the fatal crash was unlawful and conducted in violation of applicable statutes, rules, and policies,” Sleigh wrote in his recent filings. 
“Disturbingly,” the attorney added, “the findings of the internal investigation were purposefully
withheld from the defense in a deliberate attempt to deprive him of a fair trial.”
Sleigh wrote in the filings in Rutland County Superior criminal court that Rutland City police leadership kept silent about the report’s findings for months.
He cited a Brady letter Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan, the lead prosecutor in the case, issued against retiring Rutland City Police Chief Brian Kilcullen, as well as retired Rutland City Police Commander Sam Delpha, who conducted and authored the report. 
A Brady letter, which gets its name from a national court case, is filed when an officer’s credibility is called into question.
Sullivan wrote in that letter that Kilcullen and Delpha had improperly failed to disclose the findings of the internal affairs report that criticized police officers for their roles in the vehicle pursuit to “shape” the case against Rheaume. However, Sullivan said in a recent court filing that any possible police department policy violations do not negate Rheaume’s criminal responsibility in the case.
“The IA report is replete with evidence that will illuminate the RCPD’s bias and motivation to obscure the truth relating to the fatal crash,” Sleigh wrote in his recent filings. “All of that will be introduced to challenge the credibility of the State’s critical witnesses.”
Kilcullen announced his retirement last month, and has not responded to requests for comment about what prompted that decision to leave.
The pursuit leading to the murder charge against Rheaume, according to police, ended on Woodstock Avenue in Rutland when he slammed nearly head-on into a cruiser driven by Ebbighausen.
Ebbighausen had been with the Rutland City Police Department as a part-time officer and was set to begin training the following month to get her full-time certification. 
Rheaume, 22, was also injured in the crash. He was charged shortly after the incident with grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a resulting death and attempting to elude police leading to a fatal crash.
Several months later, Rheaume was arraigned on the upgraded charges, including the aggravated murder count, and has been held without bail since then. 
The charges were upgraded following additional investigation into the crash by both Vermont and New York state police. According to that investigation, Rheaume engaged in dangerous driving at high speeds on the heavily traveled Woodstock Avenue, also known as Route 4, before the crash.
Rheaume, through an earlier attorney who was representing him at that time, challenged the court order holding him without bail. However, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in August 2024 that Rheaume would remain behind bars while the case against him remained pending. 
Sleigh argued in his filings that the most recent revelations in the internal affairs report “substantially” weakened the state’s case against his client, warranting a striking of the order that Rheaume be held without bail.
In a 16-page response he wrote along with Rutland County Deputy State’s Attorney Daron Raleigh, Sullivan said he opposed Sleigh’s request to the court. According to the prosecutors, the findings of the internal affairs report do not change that it was Rheaume who was driving the truck that struck and killed Ebbighausen.
“Mr. Rheaume was the one who pressed his accelerator until he was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed; Mr. Rheaume was the one who chose to turn into Officer Ebbighausen’s lane of travel; Mr. Rheaume is the one who took no evasive action before hitting Officer Ebbighausen; and Mr. Rheaume is the one who did not brake,” the prosecutors wrote.
“Those actions and inactions by Mr. Rheaume are the natural and continuous sequence of events that killed Officer Ebbighausen,” the prosecutors added. “That sequence of events did not require any actions by another person to come into being.”
Sleigh said Thursday that, should the judge hold a hearing on his request seeking his client’s release, one of the people he would want to testify would be Kilcullen.
Sleigh has called on state and federal authorities to investigate Kilcullen for criminal charges, including obstruction of justice, for his handling of the internal affairs matter and failure to disclose its findings. 
Sullivan declined to comment Thursday.
Rheaume is currently held at the Springfield prison. If convicted of the aggravated murder charge — the most serious state criminal charge — he faces up to life behind bars without the possibility of parole.

Tilted, “A Toast to Our Nation’s 250th Anniversary: Inspired by Founders. Grown by Farmers,” the work was designed and crafted by Jim Victor and Marie Pelton of Conshohocken, who have made 24 butter sculptures for the annual event. 
“It’s an honor to be part of the tradition every year,” said Victor. “Especially for this commemorative year, the 110th Farm show and the 250th anniversary of our nation.”
The butter was donated by Land O’Lakes in Cumberland County. When the Farm Show wraps up, it will be recycled at Reinford Farms in Juniata County, which will convert it into renewable energy in a methane digester. 
Nearly 600,000 Pennsylvanians work in the agricultural industry, which contributes $132.5 billion to the state’s economy annually, according to the state ag department.

Santiago/Getty Images)Despite vows to restrict immigration authorities’ access to Washington state Department of Licensing information, the data sharing continued in a new form, researchers revealed Thursday.
The University of Washington Center for Human Rights reports that federal immigration agents searched Department of Licensing data before stopping drivers at least nine times between August and November.
State officials say they cut off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to this data in mid-November.
In a joint statement, the licensing department and Washington State Patrol said Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action” in the face of the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement tactics.
“But he will do so with reason and care,” the agencies said. “Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law-enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety.”
The researchers say U.S. Customs and Border Protection still has access to the data, but the state argues that’s necessary for the agency’s work at the Canadian border and airports.
The state’s Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, prevents state data from being shared with federal authorities for civil immigration purposes. Washington is one of 19 states that offer driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status.
Concerns over federal access to this state data date back to at least 2018. But the worries have ramped up in the past year as President Donald Trump has pushed for drastic increases in immigration enforcement and deportations. The Trump administration has focused on accessing various troves of state data to apparently fuel its immigration operations. 
Over the summer, KING 5 revealed continued data sharing through the Department of Licensing’s driver and plate database, known as DAPS. The investigation found hundreds of searches of Washington records after Trump retook office, prompting outcries from immigration advocates.
After this, state officials announced they’d stop ICE from accessing Washington’s driver license data through this avenue.
Malou Chávez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s “clear that there are cracks in systems here in Washington state that need fixing to truly protect our communities.”
“Washington, as a welcoming state, cannot and should not aid the federal government in its goal of mass detention, mass deportation by providing access to information, allowing our data to be used for civil immigration enforcement when we have laws specifically prohibiting this from happening,” she told reporters.
How it works
The form of data sharing revealed Thursday forces federal agencies to use a different route than the one that drew scrutiny last year. 
It’s facilitated by a nonprofit that police agencies use to share driver’s license data across states. This allows them to easily search through a platform known as Nlets for information on drivers from out of state that officers pull over. 
A Washington State Patrol platform called ACCESS allows users into the state’s data held by Nlets. The Department of Licensing data shared through this platform includes drivers’ license numbers and photos, home addresses and vehicles’ registered owners, according to the UW researchers.
So, for example, agents could stake out a business, run the license plates of all the cars parked there to get the owners’ names, then look up their immigration statuses and arrest them. 
The UW center’s report includes instances where the licensing department information has been used. 
In one case in November, ICE agents saw a Washington resident in Oregon leaving a Latino grocer. They ran his license plate through the Washington State Patrol system, then searched his name through their own database and found he wasn’t authorized to be in the country, according to the report.
Federal authorities pulled over his vehicle and arrested him, according to researchers.
“These folks are real Washingtonians who have been affected,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. “They are people with lives and families and communities and rights, and they have been harmed by the fact that the DOL allows these agencies to access its data for civil and not criminal immigration enforcement.”
Call for action
In November, Democrats in Congress alerted many states that they were unknowingly sharing information with ICE.
In letters to the states’ governors, they noted Washington, along with Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, had blocked ICE access to their driver’s license data. They wrote that Washington made the move after “engaging with Congressional Democrats.”
Washington state officials said “thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied” since shutting off access to Nlets data on Nov. 19.
But this still leaves the door open for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE subagency, to continue searching Washington’s data, the UW researchers believe. 
Customs and Border Protection conducted the data searches in eight of the nine arrests the center documented. Almost all of the arrests were for civil immigration enforcement, not criminal matters. Though when searching the data, the federal agencies don’t need to note if it’s for a criminal or civil investigation. 
“The state is granting them that access on the good faith assumption that they’re only going to use it for criminal investigations, and the data that we’ve presented here shows that that is not the case,” Godoy said. “They are using it in ways that are contrary to state law.”
The researchers called on the state to block all federal immigration authorities from accessing Washington’s Nlets data. 
“We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety,” reads the statement from the Department of Licensing and state patrol.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
In an executive order in September, Ferguson ordered state agencies to “continue to review their data collection, sharing, and retention policies to ensure they are treating the protection of residents’ personal and private information as a matter of public interest and safety.”
The letters to governors, led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said that in the year preceding Oct. 1, federal immigration authorities searched driver’s license databases roughly 900,000 times across the country. 
The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data. Godoy said the nine cases documented so far “likely represent the tip of the iceberg.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ice-officer-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 17:12:36.355412
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 21:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT minimum wage increases to $16.94. Gov. Lamont celebrates impact,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/minimum-wage-increase-ct/,"The state’s most recent increase, announced in the fall, has pushed CT to one of highest statewide minimum wages in the country.","For more than a decade, business owner Rory Gale has run Hartford Prints!, using her downtown Hartford storefront to sell cards, state-themed apparel and home goods. The business, which recently expanded its longtime location on Pratt Street, has become a popular destination in Hartford, serving as a shining example of the city’s efforts to revitalize downtown. 
Gale said the business’s success is the result of factors ranging from strong community support to local grant funding. At a press conference Thursday morning, Gale said state policy has helped her, too — particularly Connecticut’s indexed minimum wage, which rose to $16.94 on Jan. 1. 
“I have hired so many employees over the years, and feel so proud to be in a state that has a minimum wage like Connecticut,” she said.
Since the state legislature passed a schedule of increases in 2019, Connecticut’s minimum wage has increased annually. In recent years, those increases have been tied to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ federal Employment Cost Index, which measures the changes in the cost of labor for businesses. 
The state’s most recent increase, announced in the fall, has pushed Connecticut to one of highest statewide minimum wages in the country, surpassed only by Washington, which has a wage of $17.13 an hour.
Connecticut state officials said that at a time of increased economic strain across the state and the country, a higher minimum wage helps workers get a foothold they desperately need. 
“You hear about affordability, and a lot of that is bringing down costs, and that’s also about paying people a wage that helps them survive,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday. “That’s what we’re trying to do with this wage right now.”
‘This is not just something for teenagers‘
The minimum wage increase was an early priority during Lamont first term. He’s now campaigning for a third term and seeking the support of labor organizations and workers. The governor said his work to raise the minimum wage has helped many, particularly workers of color who are overrepresented in the state’s minimum wage workforce.
According to state officials, more than 60% of minimum wage workers in Connecticut are women or people of color, with women of color representing a large portion of this group.
“This is not just something for teenagers. This is not just an after school job,” said state labor commissioner Danté Bartolomeo. “This is how they support themselves and how they support their families, and when they’re not making a fair wage, they have to work more and have less quality of life, which leads to all kinds of other complications, stress and health and all of those kinds of things”
Still, the minimum wage increase has long been a source of political division, with state Democrats largely arguing that the increase is a necessary economic justice issue intended to address disparities and help narrow income gaps. State Republicans, meanwhile, have argued that the wage increases will stifle economic growth, harming small business owners who are unable to manage constantly increasing wages.
The minimum wage increase has also been criticized by groups like the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which has argued that the annual rise will negatively affect businesses already dealing with economic uncertainty and rising expenses, potentially encouraging business owners to move to states with friendlier policies.

Lamont however, challenged those arguments. “Going back to 2019, a lot of folks said, ‘If you raise the minimum wage, it’s going to be a parade of horribles,” he said. “‘You’re going to shut down the economy. Unemployment is going to surge. The economy is going to drag to a halt.’” 
Pointing to the state’s recent GDP growth, which rose 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025 and an unemployment rate that continues to be below the national average, Lamont argued that those fears have not come to pass. 
“It’s just the opposite,” he said. “Paying people a decent wage is a show of respect for them.”
There’s still room for new legislation on the issue
Still, even with the state’s improved minimum wage, there is still some unfinished business on the topic. The state’s tipped minimum wage, which covers tipped workers like restaurant and hotel workers as well as a different tipped wage for bartenders, has remained at $6.38 and $8.23 respectively,  for several years.
While there have been efforts to increase those wages to match the indexed minimum wage, including through the growing national One Fair Wage movement, Connecticut has yet to eliminate the tipped minimum wage, with bills in 2023 and 2024 clearing committee but failing to come to the floor of either chamber for a vote.
The current tipped minimum wage has been supported by groups like the Connecticut Restaurant Association, which argues that the current wage structure, which allows for workers to make the tipped minimum wage and add their tips on top, works well for restaurants in the state and allows workers to make far more than the current indexed minimum wage.
Asked about state leaders’ support for changing the tipped minimum wage on Thursday, Bartolomeo noted that the issue is up to state lawmakers to address. “We’ll have to see what the Legislature feels about that this year,” she said.
And while minimum wage increases have helped some of the state’s lowest paid workers, officials acknowledged that the minimum wage is still not enough for one person to truly live on. According to the MIT Living Wage calculator, a “living wage”, defined as a wage that allows a person to meet all of their basic needs, is over $25 an hour for a single adult with no children.
Lamont noted that helping people address those needs, as well as decreasing the state’s rising costs of living remain a priority for his administration. Still, he argued that the new minimum wage is a sign of progress. 
“When we came into office in 2019, this state and this country had been waging what they call a”Fight for $15″—a $15 minimum wage—for many years,” he said. “Connecticut won that fight.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2812-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

(Photo by Getty Images)The Wabanaki Nations will now have exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine.
Gov. Janet Mills announced Thursday that she would allow legislation passed by both chambers last session to become law, despite her administration’s initial opposition to the proposal. 
Mills met with the elected chiefs of Mi’kmaq Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Penobscot Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribes at Indian Township and Sipayik this fall, “who each spoke passionately about the importance of this bill in offering life-changing revenue for Tribal communities, as well as providing a form of economic sovereignty for their Nations,” she said in a statement.
She said while she has concerns about the impact of gambling on public health, she believes online gambling should be regulated, “and I am confident that Maine’s Gambling Control Unit will develop responsible rules and standards to hold providers of this new form of gambling accountable while ensuring that Maine’s tribes benefit from its operations.”
The Wabanaki chiefs applauded the law in statements provided by the governor’s office, thanking Mills and underscoring the economic boon it would provide to their Tribes as well as neighboring rural communities.
Wabanaki leaders reflect on gains as Legislature poised to revisit sovereignty proposals

Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis applauded Mills for working with the Tribes on this issue. “This cooperative approach and open-mindedness have led to passage of a historic Tribal economic bill that will benefit not just the Wabanaki people but all of Maine,” Francis said. “It represents a recognition of and support for economic Tribal self-governance and self-determination.” 
Mi’kmaq Chief Sheila McCormack said, “This bill will provide new and sustainable revenue that will deliver needed resources to invest in our community and provide for the health, welfare, and safety of our citizens.”
Clarissa Sabattis, chief of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, called the new law “an incredible step for all of us.”
“For too long black-market websites have hosted illegal iGaming, with no protection for our youth and vulnerable adults,” Sabattis said. “LD 1164 will create a closely regulated iGaming market with strict controls and will ensure much needed revenues remain in Maine.”
The federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act has made it so the Wabanaki Nations are treated more akin to municipalities than independent nations, one way being that the Tribes are unable to benefit from any federal law passed after 1980, unless they are specifically mentioned in the law.
In 2022, the Maine Legislature amended the Settlement Act to permit Tribes to handle sports betting, so the new law would build off of that earlier expansion signed by Mills. 
In a nod to this history, McCormack said, “For almost 20 years, our Nation struggled to gain the ear of Maine’s governors, but under the leadership of Governor Mills, and her commitment to respectful and open communication, our jurisdiction has been reestablished.”
Mills has not supported every effort to expand sovereignty, opposing sweeping reforms in favor of taking a piecemeal approach to changing the Settlement Act. In June, the governor vetoed legislation that sought to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. 
Nearly half of the candidates vying to replace Mills have pledged to back full sovereignty if they win the gubernatorial election in November.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/internet-gambling-2048x1363-4-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Tim Walz,” Leavitt said. ‘Absolute immunity’The FBI has refused to allow the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation to have access to evidence or other case materials in order to investigate the shooting.  When reporters in the White House briefing room pressed Vance on why the FBI is refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement officials, Vance said it was a federal issue.“The idea that Tim Walz and a bunch of radicals in Minneapolis are going to go after and make this guy's life miserable because he was doing the job that he was asked to do is preposterous,” Vance said. “The unprecedented thing is the idea that a local official can actually prosecute a federal official with absolute immunity.”A federal officer can be prosecuted by local and state authorities if a federal official violates state criminal laws. Absolute immunity is applied to civil liability, and extended to certain positions such as the president, judges and legislatures acting in their official duty. Qualified immunity is usually applied to the conduct of law enforcement and grants them immunity from certain legal actions.Congressional Democrats have decried the shooting and have called for a criminal investigation.",,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Jonathan Steinberg, leader of energy committee, to retire",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/rep-jonathan-steinberg-leader-of-energy-committee-to-retire/,"Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, the Democratic co-chair of the General Assembly’s Energy and Technology Committee, will not seek a ninth term.","Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, the Democratic co-chair of the General Assembly’s Energy and Technology Committee, said Thursday he will not seek a ninth term representing the 136th House District of Westport. 
Steinberg, 69, who said he has held the seat longer than any predecessor, had shared his plans months ago with political allies in Westport, a reliably Democratic shoreline community in Fairfield County.
“I have, up till at this moment, been able to avoid it being broadcast across the globe,” he said.
The moment no longer could be avoided once Matthew Mandell, 65, the executive director of the Westport-Wilton Chamber of Commerce and a member of Westport’s representative town meeting, registered as a candidate for the seat.
“He knew this was my last term, like year ago. So it’s not exactly news. There was, like, a 1% chance that there would become a reason for me to run again,” Steinberg said.
Mandell registered as a candidate Wednesday.
The committee Steinberg leads has become a battleground in recent years over the state’s aggressive regulatory posture towards Eversource and Avangrid and the utilities’ animosity towards Marissa P. Gillett during her tenure as the top regulator.
Gillett resigned in September as chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority amid industry and some legislative complaints over her transparency, veracity and leadership style.
One issue was what role she had in producing an opinion piece harshly critical of the utilities that was published by the Connecticut Mirror under the bylines of Steinberg and his co-chair, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex.
Gillett later admitted deleting an exchange of text messages with Steinberg, though both maintained that she did not help write the piece. Needleman and Steinberg both were defenders of Gillett.
Steinberg said Thursday the controversity played no role in his decision to retire after his current two-year term ends in January 2027.
“It’s been a long time. It’ll be 16 years when this year’s done. I think I’ve had a good run between,” Steinberg said. “My wife retired in October. She’s happily retired at home. I’ll be 70 in a few weeks. Seems like the right time.”
Steinberg is no stranger to legislative controversies. He previously was the co-chair of the Public Health Committee as it drafted and eventually passed legislation repealing the religious exemption on school-age vaccinations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_180-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Former wildlife officials warn Trump-appointed team they can’t haphazardly dispose of refuge land, though many support a review of the embattled national system.
The post Wyoming’s Coursey leads National Wildlife Refuge System audit that’s igniting sell-off worries appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming mule deer advocate is leading a Trump administration review of the National Wildlife Refuge System as former agency officials worry the effort is being rushed and may lead to divesting of federal land owned by all Americans. 
Josh Coursey, a Donald Trump-appointed senior advisor to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik, will undertake a “programmatic comprehensive review” of the 573-unit refuge system, according to Nesvik’s Dec. 16 order. The review also will inventory five marine national monuments, 71 national fish hatcheries and more.
Coursey is the co-founder of Wyoming’s Muley Fanatic Foundation. WyoFile was unable to reach him for an interview before this story published. Nesvik is the former director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

The review of hatcheries, marine monuments and 96 million acres of national refuge land — an area larger than Montana — is being rushed and may not account for the purposes for which various refuges were established, seven former career refuge system officials wrote to Nesvik in a Jan. 5 email obtained by WyoFile.
The retirees, who have hundreds of years of combined experience, warned Coursey that the Fish and Wildlife Service “does not have broad authority to dispose of lands” in the refuge system. 
“With certain limited exceptions, [refuge] lands can be disposed of only by act of Congress,” the retirees wrote. 
The seven retirees, who reached the upper echelon of the Fish and Wildlife Service, signed the email to Nesvik, Coursey and Dave Miko, the agency’s acting deputy director for operations. They include four former deputy directors: Marshall Jones, Gary Frazer, James Kurth and Greg Siekaniec. The other three signers are: retired National Wildlife Refuge System Chief Geoffrey Haskett, Division of Migratory Bird Management Chief Brad Bortner and Megan Durham, a former deputy assistant director of external affairs at Fish and Wildlife.

The ad-hoc group also appears worried that Nesvik’s order signals some refuges or hatcheries might be eliminated. Nesvik asked field managers to “look for refuges or hatcheries established for a purpose that no longer aligns with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] mission.”
Nesvik’s directive calls for “an initial summary of organizational change recommendations” due by Monday with final recommendations due Feb. 15. That’s a rushed timeline, the former officials contend. 
“Such a large and important analysis should certainly be given more time and resources to develop a thoughtful and useful product,” their email reads.
Nesvik responded immediately, according to Jones, one of the deputy directors who signed the email.
“Brian stays on top of his email,” Jones told WyoFile in a Wednesday telephone interview. “I’m very impressed.”
Nesvik wrote, “I appreciate you and the other co-signers’ efforts to provide your initial thoughts and offer your assistance in our review,” according to Jones, who didn’t share the email but read it to WyoFile.
Nesvik sent the email to Durham, one of the retirees.
“You can expect to hear from someone on the team in the coming weeks as we conduct this important work,” Nesvik wrote.
Room for improvement
The ad-hoc group of retirees supports the overall review.
“We think it’s a good idea,” Jones said. “I’m sure there’s always improvements that can be made.”
The National Wildlife Refuge Association’s president is also cautiously standing behind the Coursey-led assessment. 
“It is a good and necessary thing to understand the complexity of the situation,” President Desiree Sorenson-Groves told WyoFile. 
The audit comes on the heels of long-term declines in staffing and funding that have left the whole system “at risk,” with not a single refuge possessing the resources it requires, according to a recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inventory. Since 2010, national wildlife refuges have hemorrhaged more than 30% of their employees, mainly as a result of losing funding, Sorenson-Groves said.
“Before the second Trump administration, the refuge system was already in a dire place,” she said.

Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” exacerbated the situation, further trimming staff at refuges and hatcheries in Wyoming and beyond. Last month, 20 Democratic U.S. senators wrote Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “sound the alarm” on the service’s “staffing crisis.”
“A startling amount of staff and expertise needed to manage the refuge system and protect America’s wildlife have been lost due to the administration’s firings, early retirement programs, and other efforts to push staff out of FWS,” the senators wrote in a Dec. 18 letter. “We ask that you provide Congress with your plan to address FWS’s staffing crisis…”
Meanwhile, Sorenson-Groves is holding out hope that the audit now underway won’t result in recommendations that further whittle away at wildlife refuges, or proposals that would sell them off. 
“If that is the case, then we will deal with that,” she said. “You don’t just divest refuges, as they [the retirees] pointed out in that letter. There’s a process, most of them are public processes, and there would have to be a really good reason.”

Another underpinning to the retirees’ worries is the distinction between the refuge system and the Fish and Wildlife Service itself. That difference appears lost in Nesvik’s order.
“The refuge system has its own organic act that lays out the purposes of the system — the way the system should operate,” Jones said. “It’s not just a subsidiary part of the Fish and Wildlife Service.”
(Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission is “working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people,” according to the agency website.)
The retiree’s email to Nesvik states that federal laws establish specific purposes for individual refuges, “and any review should use these as a guideline, not the overall mission of the FWS.” Federal laws say refuge units should be managed for “the specific purposes for which each refuge was established,” the email says.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act also obligates the U.S. to conserve cross-border avian migrants, the retirees stated. 
‘Things that concern me’
Jones wouldn’t characterize his former colleagues’ views about what’s been called Trump’s anti-environmental agenda, but he has worries.
“It’s not about the political party — it is about the mindset and what people think is important,” Jones said. “There are things that concern me about the current administration. The concerns are very significant now.”
Migratory birds are declining, and even mule deer are another species “in trouble,” Jones said. It’s “a fight” to educate people about the needs of wildlife and make sure those needs are taken into account amid development pressure and pollution that weighs on the natural world, he said.
“The worries don’t magically disappear, depending on what administration is in power in Washington D.C. or state capitols,” he said. “We are passionate advocates of the refuge system [and marine sanctuaries]. These areas are important to the American people for the long-term health of our country’s resources, and they make large financial contributions to the communities involved.”
According to Nesvik’s order, the National Wildlife Refuge System review is to be completed along with “a list of actionable recommendations” no later than Feb. 15. The agency is not soliciting comments from the general public, but it did establish a system so that refuge system staff could anonymously provide feedback. 
The National Wildlife Refuge Association will be weighing in too, using the same approach the retirees did — sending an email.  
“Josh [Coursey] and Dave [Miko], I know that they’re actually interested in hearing feedback,” Sorenson-Groves said. “I’m not jumping to any conclusions because I want to see where they go with this.”

(Screenshot from Zoom)A lawsuit that says the Trump administration violated Colorado’s state sovereignty has been updated to cite additional federal actions the state says are unconstitutional, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.
The Trump administration has “ramped up a widespread campaign of retribution to punish Colorado” in recent weeks, Weiser, a Democrat running for Colorado governor, said in a press call Thursday.
An October lawsuit says President Donald Trump’s decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama is an unconstitutional violation of state sovereignty, since he said he based that decision on how Colorado runs its elections.

Trump’s moves to terminate transportation funding for Colorado, close the National Center for Atmospheric Research, require updated eligibility interviews for people receiving federal food assistance, and deny Federal Emergency Management Agency relief for areas affected by wildfires and flooding also violate state sovereignty, the amended lawsuit says.
“This series of events and the timing, demonstrate and reflect an unmistakable campaign of punishment and threats directed at Colorado to respond to what is the lawful exercise of our sovereign authority,” Weiser said. “And sadly, indications are more might be coming.”
Trump has targeted Colorado because of its use of mail ballots in its elections and because the state has refused to release Tina Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, according to Weiser. The president threatened “harsh measures” if she isn’t released. 










This series of events and the timing, demonstrate and reflect an unmistakable campaign of punishment and threats directed at Colorado to respond to what is the lawful exercise of our sovereign authority.


– Phil Weiser, Colorado attorney general


“Our Constitution’s clear. States have the power to manage elections and administer our criminal justice systems,” Weiser said. “No administration has sought to take away this power and to try to force states to bend to its will.  This administration cannot be allowed to do so either.”
The amended lawsuit does not include the Trump administration’s recent move to block Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and child care funding, but Weiser said to “stay tuned,” indicating a separate lawsuit could be coming.
Weiser’s lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court of Colorado to declare Trump’s “vindictive” actions specifically targeting Colorado unconstitutional and to bar federal agencies from enforcing the actions. 
“I recognize this is a novel request, and that’s because this is an unprecedented administration. We’ve never seen an administration act in a way that is so flatly violating the Constitution and disrespecting state sovereign authority,” Weiser said. “We have to protect our authority, defend the principles we believe in. That’s why we’re going forward in court.”

,California,2026-01-08 21:40:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom touts his successes, swipes at Trump in final State of the State speech",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/newsom-successes-swipes-state-speech/,Newsom denounced Trump's cutbacks in federal child care funds and his refusal to send relief funds after the wildfires in Los Angeles County.,"California’s constitution requires the governor to “report to the Legislature each calendar year on the condition of the state and may make recommendations.”
For the past seven years, Gavin Newsom has reluctantly and minimally honored that command, usually eschewing the traditional January address to a joint legislative session in the Capitol.
But today, entering the final year of his governorship, he delivered a 64-minute, no-script paean to legislators that catalogued his achievements and portrayed the state as a model for the world, while interspersing harsh criticism of President Donald Trump as an autocrat who is undermining democracy.
Thus it was not only a celebratory swan song but a platform of sorts for Newsom’s all-but-certain campaign to succeed Trump in 2028 — implying that a prosperous, inclusive and generous California could become a model for the nation should he occupy the White House.
Newsom only mentioned Trump by name twice, once while denouncing cutbacks in federal child care funds and near the end, excoriating his refusal to send billions of dollars in relief for the deadly wildfires that swept through Los Angeles County exactly a year ago.
Newsom termed it “a complete failure to act” and added, “It’s time for the president of the United States to act like the president of the United States.”
During the speech, Newsom also dropped a few hints about what he wants to happen during his final year as governor — particularly about putting the state’s finances in order. Ever since Newsom erroneously proclaimed in 2022 that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus and he and the Legislature ramped up spending, the budget has been plagued with multibillion-dollar deficits that have been papered over with accounting gimmicks, off-the-books loans and transfers from emergency reserves.
The Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, has projected another $18 billion deficit for 2026-27, perhaps growing to $35 billion thereafter.
Newsom told legislators that his proposed budget, which will be unveiled Friday, anticipates an additional $42.3 billion in revenues, based on recent increases in tax payments. It will, he said, close the gap and provide money to restore reserves, pay down the state’s pension debt and finance increases in some programs, including a jump in education support.
Were the Legislature to embrace Newsom’s rosy fiscal scenario, it would allow him to end his governorship a year hence with a budget that, at least on paper, would be in the black.
However, recent history implies that Newsom’s projected revenue windfall should be viewed with skepticism. His Department of Finance quietly acknowledged later that his 2022 claim of a $97.5 billion surplus was based on a $165 billion overstatement of revenues over four years.
All in all, it was arguably the most cogent address that Newsom has delivered as governor, even if it ignored, downplayed or rationalized some of California’s most vexing issues, such as the nation’s highest rates of homelessness, unemployment, poverty and living costs, not to mention the budget deficit.
It was clearly aimed, Newsom suggested, at refuting a “California derangement syndrome” that sees the state as a hellhole of crime and squalor, with taxes and regulations that suffocate business and drive people to other states.
It’s a clever play on the “Trump derangement syndrome” that those on the political right often tout. Wordplay notwithstanding, if and when Newsom makes his presidential ambitions official his most daunting factor will be simply that he’s from California.
Reality lies somewhere between the exalted view of California that Newsom peddles, claiming “we simply have no peer,” and the dystopian image that dominates right wing media.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) put forth a plan on Thursday to utilize the full force of the federal government to address the nation’s housing crisis, following up on a previous call to declare a national emergency on housing. 
“There is nothing more fundamental to the American Dream than owning your own home, and it has become increasingly difficult for middle class Americans to do this,” Slotkin said in a statement. “The United States is in a housing crisis, and we need to act now. That’s why my bill declares a national housing emergency, cuts regulations that get in the way and uses the full weight of the U.S. government to increase our housing supply by 4 million homes.”
To meet that goal, Slotkin’s National Housing Emergency Act would instruct domestic industries to boost production of lumber, steel, and manufactured housing to speed up construction and rehabilitation.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill sets a minimum residential code standard to ensure the emergency declaration does not support the proliferation of poor-quality housing. It also includes a “pro-growth requirement” for communities seeking federal block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. 
Additionally, the act pushes states and localities to cut red tape by compelling them to change laws to allow commercial properties to be turned into housing, eliminate single-family zoning and allow for accessory dwelling units, sometimes referred to as “in-law suites” or “granny flats.”
It also bars states and localities from passing laws, rules or regulations that would impair the build out or rehab of housing during the emergency, which is set to end when either 4 million units of housing are built or rehabilitated, or in October 2031.
The bill does not currently have bipartisan support, making it unlikely to gain ground in the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate.

(File photo provided by Clemson University)COLUMBIA — A Clemson University professor fired over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk’s death will get paid through the end of the semester, though he can’t return to any classroom at the college, according to a legal settlement.
Joshua Bregy, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, sued the university in October, about a month after getting fired. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union argued Bregy’s firing violated his First Amendment right to free speech.

PUBLIC Bregy Mediated Settlement 260103 
Along with dropping his lawsuit, Bregy agreed to resign effective May 15, the end of his original contract. Until then, the university will continue to pay him and supply benefits, according to the agreement. During the 2024-2025 school year, Bregy made $91,190, according to Clemson’s salary database.
Bregy, who has worked at Clemson since January 2023, can’t teach, conduct research or interact with students this semester. If he applies for grants, he can list Clemson as his place of employment, and university leadership will give him positive recommendations as he searches for another job, according to the settlement.
“We were honored to represent Dr. Bregy and to reach an agreement that restores his employment, allows him to continue to pursue research funding, and deters the university from violating the First Amendment rights of its faculty in the future,” ACLU attorney Allen Chaney said in a statement. “Politicians and university administrators come and go, but years from now we will still be here. So will the U.S. Constitution.”
In a statement, Clemson spokesman Joe Galbraith confirmed that Bregy will not work in a classroom or with students this semester and noted that both sides of the lawsuit must follow through on their ends of the agreement to make it official.
Another professor and a faculty member were also fired over social media posts criticizing Kirk, a conservative activist, in the days after a gunman fatally shot him in the neck as he debated students during an outdoor event at a Utah university. The other two employees have not sued.
Bregy did not write the Facebook post that lost him his job. The post that Bregy shared but later deleted condemned violence while also pointing to a comment Kirk made about gun violence, calling it “worth it to have the cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year” to maintain constitutional gun rights.
“I’ll never advocate for violence in any form, but it sounds to me like karma is sometimes swift and ironic,” read the Facebook post, included in full in the lawsuit. “As Kirk said, ‘play certain games, win certain prizes.’”
The Clemson College Republicans shared the Facebook post on X, formerly Twitter, alongside other photographs of Bregy holding signs saying Black Lives Matter and climate change was real. From there, the post gained traction, including among state and federal legislators, who called for Bregy’s firing.
The university initially put out a statement saying it disagreed with the sentiments but recognized faculty members’ rights to free speech under the First Amendment, prompting outcry from some who didn’t consider that enough. Republican legislators from both Statehouse chambers, including the lead budget writers, called on the Clemson Board of Trustees to “take immediate and appropriate action,” without clarifying what that meant.
The board suspended Bregy and the other professor on Sept. 15, five days after the Facebook post. Bregy received a letter of termination the next day, saying he “did not show due restraint or respect” and did not clarify that his views did not represent those of Clemson, according to the lawsuit.
Bregy’s firing was part of a nationwide wave of people losing their jobs because of posts criticizing Kirk or celebrating his death.
Some, like Bregy, reached settlements with their former employers, winning back their jobs. Most recently, a tenured professor at Austin Peay State University in Tennessee who was briefly fired because of a post about Kirk received a $500,000 settlement, as well as his job back.

Maura Healey’s office announced Thursday.
Federal enhanced premium tax credits expired at the end of December, creating turmoil for residents whose subsidies had protected them from steep premium hikes. Healey’s relief plan brings ConnectorCare funding to a total of $600 million, which the governor’s office called the “largest state investment in the country.”
The extra state aid is intended to ensure that about 270,000 residents enrolled in ConnectorCare and making below 400 percent of the federal poverty level “will see little to no premium increases because of the expiring federal credits, while also lowering other out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles,” Healey’s office said. That threshold applies to individuals earning up to $62,600 and families of four earning up to $128,600.
“This continued commitment means hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents can continue to afford coverage that’s there for them when they need it, keeping them healthy and financially secure,” Connector Executive Director Audrey Morse Gasteier said. “This commitment reinforces Massachusetts’s standing as the state with the most significant investment in affordable coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.”
While showcasing her plan for the state to step in, Healey on Thursday continued to call on the federal government to “extend these federal credits so that people can afford the health insurance that they need.” 
The $250 million will come from the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, Healey’s office said. It’s not clear how much money is currently in that fund. 
State law says that money “credited to the fund shall be expended without further appropriation for programs administered by the commonwealth health insurance connector authority.”  The governor’s office described her proposal as a “plan” and said she had “directed the Health Connector to sustain this increased investment.” 
The fund receives money from employer contributions, transfers from the currently overburdened Health Safety Net Trust Fund, and revenue tied to penalties paid by residents who don’t meet the state’s health insurance mandate. Bay Staters must have insurance coverage that meets certain standards or face a penalty.
The infusion offers an “additional subsidy” for people enrolled in ConnectorCare plans designed for residents earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, Connector spokesperson Jason Lefferts said.
Healey said she directed the Connector to explore other populations that can benefit from heavily subsidized ConnectorCare. The Connector and MassHealth are also exploring other options to prevent coverage losses stemming from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which analysts warn could double the state’s uninsured rate.
To highlight the impact of the $250 million plan, Healey’s office used the example of a 45-year-old couple in Fall River who have two kids and make $75,000. They previously paid $166 monthly for the “lowest cost coverage,” though that figure would have more than doubled to $452 with the expiring subsidies. With the new ConnectorCare boost, the couple will now pay $206 monthly.
Under a federal policy change not linked to the expiring tax credits, residents with legal status who earned below 100 percent of the federal poverty level lost their eligibility for ConnectorCare on January 1. Healey’s plan does not restore this ConnectorCare plan type, Lefferts said.
Due to the expiring tax credits, the Health Connector has said subsidized coverage would not be available in 2026 for households earning between 400 percent and 500 percent of the federal poverty level. 
Open enrollment at the Health Connector wraps up on January 23. As of last week, nearly 23,000 Bay Staters had terminated their coverage through the Connector this cycle, and 23,596 people newly signed up for plans.
The Connector’s open enrollment dashboard notes that individuals who qualify for unsubsidized coverage in 2026 — either because of a loss of federal subsidies or they were already unsubsidized in 2025 — “are more likely to have canceled their 2026 coverage than other types of current enrollees.”
As of Jauary. 4, the Connector counted 368,436 enrollments — with 273,909 people signed up for ConnectorCare, according to the dashboard.

Updated 4:51 p.m.
MONTPELIER—Vermont school districts could see their spending capped beginning in 2028 if the Legislature passes a bill introduced Thursday by Senate Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.
The bill, S.220, is meant to contain the growing cost of public education in Vermont while lawmakers get back to work on the education reform that began last session.
“We have to take the moment in our hands and try to do something about this ed fund growing by leaps and bounds,” Baruth said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s just a situation where, with everybody acting in good intentions, it’s producing a nightmare for the budget.”

The legislation would limit the growth in each school district’s per pupil education spending in fiscal years 2028 and 2029.
Julia Richter, a principal fiscal analyst with the Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, said during a Senate Finance Committee meeting Thursday that if the bill was implemented in fiscal year 2027 — the budget year starting July 1 — the state would save an estimated $67 million. That projection is based on preliminary local school budget data, as school districts are actively crafting their budgets for the next school year. 
Under the language of the bill, the cap on a school district’s spending would be tied to district’s per student spending in the prior fiscal year.
“So, if you were a high spending district, you’d be able to spend less. If you’re a low spending district, you’d be able to spend more,” Baruth said in an interview Wednesday. “The idea is to try to reach equity.”
In Vermont, where school districts are granted wide latitude to set their budgets, the lowest spending districts sometimes spend half the amount per student that the highest spenders approve. 
Baruth’s bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance after its introduction on the Senate floor Thursday.
The legislation mirrors a similar concept proposed during the 2024 legislative session that would have created “allowable spending percentages,” specific annual growth rates each school district would have had to stay within during subsequent budget cycles.
Under that legislation, lower-spending districts would have been able to increase spending more than their higher-spending counterparts. But the legislation ultimately did not come to pass.
Baruth’s legislation comes as Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he plans on using about $75 million in excess revenue to dampen an expected 12% average property tax increase. That spike is driven in part by a projected $115 million increase in education spending next year.
“While it goes against the grain and doesn’t actually fix the problem we’re trying to solve, I’ll be asking you to provide some property tax relief with another band-aid,” Scott said on Wednesday during his State of the State address.
Even as similar property tax buy-downs have become common in recent years, average education property taxes have risen more than 40% across the state in the last five years, according to the Vermont Tax Department.
Baruth said he generally supports Scott’s use of General Fund dollars to buy down education costs, but said it must be contingent on efforts to cap school districts’ spending.
“I can follow him on that move,” he said, “as long as we have some kind of more immediate cost containment.”
Scott, for his part, “believes addressing spending is an important pillar of education transformation in addition to addressing quality and is encouraged by Senator Baruth introducing legislation to curb spending,” his press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said in an email.
The legislation already has detractors. Darren Allen, communications director with the Vermont-National Education Association, the statewide teachers’ union, called the bill a “non-starter.”
“We have long opposed Montpelier-based spending caps, and we’re flummoxed, frankly, at the lack of imagination coming out of Montpelier right now,” Allen said.
Allen said lawmakers should scrap the property tax as the means to pay for education and instead institute an income tax “that ensures everybody pays their fair share.”
“We know this is popular, we know this will simplify and make the way we pay for schools more transparent,” he said.
House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, on Thursday said she had concerns about Baruth’s bill. She pointed out that the state already has a version of a spending cap via the excess spending threshold, which financially penalizes districts for spending above certain amounts.
“So the question is, is that not working the way that we intended it to?” she said. “Committees in past years have taken lots and lots of testimony on cap versus excess spending threshold.”
She also questioned what impact the cap would have on school programming.
“If we’re asking people to cut more, what does that mean for our kids?” she said. “And what programs are being slashed? So, there’s a lot of questions.”

(Photo courtesy of UWF)University of West Florida trustees have approved Manny Diaz to serve as its president, the second-to-last step before moving the former education commissioner from interim to permanent leader at the Pensacola institution. 
The board’s approval is subject to confirmation by the state Board of Governors, which is expected to take up a vote later this month. 
“We cannot have an attitude that we’re just a small, sleepy institution and that we’re just good enough. There’s always room for improvement in every organization and I think we’re poised and have the opportunity to do that. And my vision is we’re aggressively going to pursue that, and we’re aggressively going to brand this university, and there’s going to be substance behind it, it’s not just flashy branding. We know we have the substance on the campus,” Diaz told trustees during a board meeting Thursday in Pensacola.

Compared to former President Martha Saunders’ final contract, Diaz is making the same auto stipend of $14,000 and $36,000 more than Saunders’ $24,000 housing stipend. Saunders’ performance bonus, as measured by a percentage of base salary, was 4% higher. Her base salary, however, was $536,273 in her last year.

The former Hialeah state lawmaker is set to take home approximately $950,000 in his first year as president, including a $674,000 base salary, up to 16% performance bonus, or $107,840, $89,000 annually for a supplemental retirement benefit, and another approximately $75,000 for car, housing, and phone stipends.
The contract provides a retention incentive. After completing his third year, he would receive $375,000. After completing his fifth year, he would receive $150,000. Those timelines started when he began his interim role, July 14, so he’s already halfway through his first year for retention bonus calculation purposes.
Makeover
UWF has been subject of a conservative makeover. Last year and at the end of 2024, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the board of governors appointed several new members to the board of trustees. In May, President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired. DeSantis’ office, when asked by the Phoenix if the governor played a role in Saunders’ resignation, responded, “Buckle up, you’re going to see a lot of changes [at UWF] for the better.”
The new slate of trustees made headlines last legislative session. Those candidates, many politically connected, faced extensive questions from senators during confirmation hearings. Two of the eight resigned before being confirmed; another, the Senate rejected. He was Adam Kissel of West Virginia and the Heritage Foundation and has since been reappointed — again, subject to Senate confirmation.
One of the trustees, Ashley Ross, worked for Diaz when he was a state senator. She said during the meeting that their work together did not necessitate her recusal.
Last month, UWF trustees approved a statement of institutional neutrality. That declares, in part, “UWF facilitates freedom of academic inquiry and of expression on any subject, which may challenge prevailing social norms, public policies, and institutional practices; however, as an institution devoted to the intellectual pursuit and communication of truth, the university itself takes no official position on public controversies outside its regular activities so as not to undermine the freedom of thought and expression necessary for that Endeavor.”
“I think from Day One, I‘ve declared clearly that we are interested, and this board has declared by passing a statement of neutrality, that we want to spur intellectual debate and conversation in a civil manner, that we want to have perspectives and ideas that are different, but that we have it respectfully,” Diaz said Thursday, adding that he expects “that one voice doesn’t get to be louder than the other.”
Diaz also focused on the importance of the university connecting with military installations in the area, athletics, listening to student input, and investment in academic programs and student life.

Fundraising
With Diaz’s experience in the Legislature, he emphasized how relationships he built in Tallahassee will be useful for fundraising for the university. He served in the Florida House from 2012-2018 and the Florida Senate 2018-2022 before DeSantis appointed him education commissioner, a role he held from 2022 until 2025. 
Diaz said that, following his time in the Legislature, he no longer fears fundraising. “I have no problem asking for money.”
“We haven’t really even scratched the surface with corporate donors,” Diaz said, calling corporations “the next layer” in fundraising. 
Opposition
UWF trustees named Diaz the sole finalist. Had they not, Thursday’s meeting would’ve included a rotating interview of the finalists, with the board making a final vote. Thursday’s meeting outcome was to little surprise.
Faculty Senate President and university Trustee Heather Riddell read into the record a prewritten statement and voted no on the measure that made Diaz the president-elect.
“Faculty have expressed concerns to me about the process in detail in the past several weeks, as a part of the committee I have some as well,” Riddell said, going on the say that she is focused on the process and not on Diaz himself. 
“The hiring of the president should be public and transparent as a public institution, we are accountable to taxpayers and our community,” Riddell said, citing the BOG regulation that requires at least three finalists to be presented to the board of trustees unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”
“There doesn’t appear to be one,” Riddell said.
During public comment, Amy Cook, vice president of the Faculty Senate, made known her concerns about the search, too. 
“Based on standard practices, this appears to be a failed search. I have served on and/or chaired several academic searches. If the committee in any of those searches thought that only one candidate was qualified, the search would’ve been reopened and expanded. If the search truly produced only one worthy candidate to bring on campus, then this should be considered a failed search,” Cook said. “If, however, there were other worthy candidates, then the perception is that this search was predetermined or flawed.”
Cook called on the university to “reconvene the committee to bring additional candidates and to bring this search to a legal, valid, and transparent conclusion.”
“This statement is not about any one candidate’s qualifications, it is about failing to go through the proper process. Not only did this committee deny the final candidate their opportunity to prove his abilities, it also denied other candidates the right to show theirs,” Cook said.
In a news release following the meeting, the university insisted it had followed the laws and regulations governing presidential searches.
More
The contract provides 20 weeks of severance pay and it requires two-thirds of the trustees to agree to terminate the agreement. 
Diaz’s contract term is five years, starting Feb. 1 and running until Feb. 1, 2031.
“Five years flies by and we hit the ground running but we want to continue that momentum and energy. This is not about sitting back, I would say if the Cabinet members thought it was going fast, they better buckle up now, because we’re going to put it into hyper drive, so none of us may be sleeping,” Diaz said. 
Chair of the Board of Governors Alan Levine congratulated Diaz on social media.
“@PresMannyDiazJr earned this. He has done a great job as the interim president, and he had strong local support for this appointment,” Levine posted to X. “I look forward to supporting his appointment when it comes to the Board of Governors, and I hope my colleagues will as well.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Most Rhode Islanders no longer think much about the signature fraud scandal that dominated news coverage during the 2023 1st Congressional District district special election.
Secretary of State Gregg Amore does. 
Amore is still on a mission to scrub the stain left by the criminal forgery of voters’ signatures — including dead residents — on Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos’ congressional nomination papers two years ago.
Matos, once considered the frontrunner in the 11-way Democratic primary, finished a distant fourth despite repeatedly proclaiming her innocence. Two contractors hired to help collect signatures for Matos’ campaign were charged with multiple criminal felonies for the forgeries.
“When the Congressional District 1 signature scandal occurred, we heard many people say we should be asking for IDs when they are collecting signatures,” Amore told the Rhode Island Board of Elections during its Tuesday meeting. “No one is going to give their ID to someone knocking on their door. But we know people are willing to give their IDs through our secure portal.”
The Rhode Island Department of State’s online voter registration system, which debuted in 2016, requires residents to share some form of personal identification — typically a driver’s license or the last four digits of their Social Security number — to register or change their voter information. Since 2023, voters have used the same system, with the same identity requirements, to apply for mail ballots.
So why not extend that technology to the signature collection process required for local, state and federal candidates to appear on the ballot? Amore pitched his first-in-the-nation online nomination paper portal to lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session. The bill passed by a decisive 53-16 margin in the House, but failed to advance out of committee in the Senate amid time constraints and questions.
Amore, a former state senator, hopes getting an early start this year will persuade his former colleagues on the merits of technological advancement. He also sought support from the Rhode Island Board of Elections at its first meeting of the year.
“This is a really good and secure way to make sure the signature is accurate,” he said in an interview with Rhode Island Current. “This way, this person is who they say they are, they live in the right district, and are alive.”










This is a really good and secure way to make sure the signature is accurate. This way, this person is who they say they are, they live in the right district, and are alive.

Other states and cities temporarily allowed online signature submissions for nomination papers during the pandemic lockdowns that complicated the 2020 elections. Arizona and New Mexico developed separate websites or mobile applications for permanent e-signature use, separate from existing voter registration databases.
The electronic portal would supplement — not supplant— physical pen and ink signature collections.

Expanding access 
Amore saw the benefit of increasing access for voting groups often left behind: people with disabilities, who might struggle to answer the door when a candidate comes knocking, along with military and overseas voters.
Candidates are likely to have an easier time meeting the minimum signature requirements to gain ballot placement: 1,000 verified signatures for U.S. senators and gubernatorial candidates, and 500 for U.S. representatives. State senators need to collect at least 100 signatures from district voters, while state representatives need 50. Municipal clerks or voting moderators must collect 10.
It would also ease pressure on local election administrators charged with sorting through and verifying thousands of paper scribbles collected by hundreds of candidates during the two-week nomination period, Amore said.
And it could help the state elections board settle questions over signatures flagged as potentially fraudulent — offering a more objective verification process than matching a hasty John Hancock with a second signature from the same voter in the state’s database.
“I love this,” Marcela Betancur, a state elections board member, said in response to Amore’s presentation Tuesday.










I love this. 


– Marcela Betancur, Rhode Island Board of Elections member


Betancur recalled her dismay at the board’s decision to reject roughly 200 signatures on candidates’ nomination papers in 2022 because the signatories did not live in the same district as the candidate.
“I almost cried sitting here,” Betancur said.
The elections board deferred making a recommendation on Amore’s draft legislation along with other election-related bills presented Tuesday. Also yet to formally signal its approval: the Rhode Island Town and City Clerks’ Association, which is slated to vote at the end of the month, Nick Lima, association chair, said in an interview Wednesday.
But Lima, who also works as elections director for the city of Cranston, expected local election clerks would be supportive.
“It makes common sense,” Lima said.

The race to verify
The two-week period, typically in July, when municipal elections teams are charged with verifying nomination signatures for local, state and federal candidates, is among the busiest and most stressful.
“We come in early, we stay late, we work through lunch,” Lima said of his four-person elections team in Cranston. “There could be over 10,000 signatures we’re looking at, on top of our regular work.”
While speed is essential, so is accuracy. Any signatures tossed, or accepted, by local elections administrators could later be challenged in front of the state elections board.
“We want to be able to stand behind our work, so we need the time to do it right,” Lima said. “It’s a bit of a sprint and a marathon combined in that whole two-week operation.”
Can Amore persuade state lawmakers? Concerns that electronic signatures collections might make it too easy for unserious candidates to get on the ballot were one reason why the Senate Committee on Judiciary failed to advance the legislation last year.
“I would think it would be harder to get 50 wet signatures than 50 electronic ones,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island. Common Cause supports the proposal anyway. 
Amore dismissed concerns over the ease of access to the ballot.
“There still has to be outreach,” he said. “If you just put this on Facebook, it’s not going to do much.”
Face to face 
Amore still envisions candidates going door to door or staking out shopping center parking lots to seek voters’ support. 
Sen. Matt LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat who sponsored the bill on Amore’s behalf in 2025, agreed face-to-face conversations with district voters were still important.
“I like going door-to-door,” LaMountain said in an interview Thursday. “It’s important for them to know who you are. And it’s good exercise.”
But rather than shoving a clipboard into their hands, expecting a signature on the spot, candidates could explain to voters how to go online at home, on their own time, and submit a signature.
Or, perhaps, bring an iPad along with them. Which presents its own potential security risks.
“If someone comes to your house with an iPad, please don’t put your personal identification information in there,” said Randy Jackvony, a state elections board member who also works in information technology. “There would need to be something that prevents that from happening.”
The draft legislation empowers the Secretary of State’s office to create additional rules and regulations governing the electronic signature submission process. One rule could address Jackvony’s concerns around security, Board of Elections Chairperson Jennie Johnson said.
Amore acknowledged the system is not risk-free. But the Department of State’s voter registration portal already undergoes regular and vigorous security reviews beyond what’s required by law, Amore said. 
The cost of the upgrade to the existing infrastructure is still undetermined, though Amore said it could be covered under federal funding for elections administration.
Legislation is expected to be introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly “very very soon,” said Rob Rock, deputy secretary of state. Sponsors have not been determined, though LaMountain said he’d be interested in backing the bill on Amore’s behalf again this year.
“Hopefully we’ll get it over the finish line this year,” LaMountain said. “It’s a good thing to lead the nation in.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson remained noncommittal in separate responses, though Shekarchi noted its strong support in the House last year. 
If approved and signed into law, the change would take effect in January 2027, with plans to implement in the 2028 midterm elections.
David Folcarelli, a spokesperson for Matos, said in an email that she supports Amore’s efforts to improve election security and accessibility but declined to comment further.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The two groups that sought to enshrine nonpartisan court races are now united behind a single ballot initiative, CI-132, put forward by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts.
The ballot initiative was one of two nearly identical constitutional initiatives launched to counter a push by Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, throughout the 2025 Legislature to make changes to the state’s judicial system, including allowing judges to run with partisan affiliation.
According to a Thursday press release, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, the group started by Ted Dick and Pepper Peterson that sponsored CI-131, announced their endorsement of CI-132.
The consolidation “signals a united effort to protect Montana voters’ 90-year right to nonpartisan judicial elections,” Dick said in a press release. “Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges believes Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts has a strong policy and the resources to ensure the initiative qualifies for the ballot, which is why we have chosen to formally endorse CI-132.”
Dick has formally requested to withdraw CI-131 with the Montana Secretary of State.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan.
The group gained endorsements from retired Montana Supreme Court Justices Mike McGrath and Pat Cotter, and lists more than 1,000 individual supporters on its website.
The text of CI-132 proposes to amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
“We know that Montanans want to protect their right to judicial elections free from the influence of political parties and politicians,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a statement. “We are proud to stand with those who have endorsed CI-131 and CI-132 and begin the work of qualifying this critical initiative for the November ballot.”
The process to get the ballot initiative before voters has already hit some bumps, including a brief legal challenge against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office initially approved the ballot measure as legally sufficient, but rewrote the language of the proposed ballot statement, arguing it did not inform voters what “nonpartisan” meant.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, which rejected the AG’s language with the majority saying it injected politics into a “straightforward proposition.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts launched signature gathering efforts for CI-132 in December and will spend the next five months talking with voters across the state about the importance of nonpartisan judicial elections.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:12:19.378623

Both votes were 248-177.Just before New Year’s, Trump vetoed two bills Congress passed without any recorded opposition in either chamber last year. They were the first vetoes of his second term.One bill would reduce interest payments that Coloradans in the Arkansas River Valley must pay for the construction of a water pipeline to Pueblo communities.The other would require the Interior Department to protect structures within Florida’s Osceola Camp from flooding.Trump said both would be too costly for federal taxpayers.Colorado members call for overrideThe House sponsor of the Colorado bill, Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, urged her colleagues in a Thursday floor speech to override the veto.“Contrary to what the veto message states, my bill does not authorize any additional federal funding,” Boebert said Thursday. “It simply modifies the repayment terms for small, rural communities in my district, so they are able to afford their 35% cost-share of the project that they are statutorily obligated to repay.”The bill extends Obama-era repayment terms for the local cost-share of a project the federal government approved in 1962.The Dec. 29 White House veto message said the measure “would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.”Members claim political retributionRep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, endorsed Boebert’s argument, but added stronger words opposing Trump’s veto.“This bill will cost taxpayers virtually nothing, as was referenced, and it makes good on a promise to the people of rural Colorado,” he said. “We are here because … the president has declared war on our state.”Neguse, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, and House Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Jared Huffman of California all said the vetoes were part of political payback by the White House, though they did not offer additional context.“No one voted against this bill,” Wasserman Schultz said. “This bill is entirely non-controversial, and it is so narrowly focused that it makes absolutely no sense, other than the interest in vengeance that seems to have emanated in this result.”Trump avoids another rebukeThe mid-afternoon vote was poised to be Congress’ second rejection of Trump on Thursday, after five Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance a measure to rein in the administration’s military activity in Venezuela. House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican, said he supported sustaining the veto because he trusted the administration.“I respect the administration’s views on this legislation and its commitment to fiscal responsibility,” Westerman said of the Colorado bill.

Filed Thursday in Franklin Circuit Court, Coleman’s lawsuit asks the court to bar Character Technologies “from future false, misleading, deceptive, and/or unfair acts or practices in relation to their creation, design, promotion, and distribution of Character.AI in the Commonwealth.” 
The suit alleges the company has violated the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, the Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Act and other laws. It  asks for $2,000 per count, among other requests. Some parts of the lawsuit are redacted. 
The Lantern has asked Character.AI for comment. 
Protecting kids, planning for data centers among AI issues KY legislature urged to tackle

Coleman accuses the company’s technology of encouraging “suicide, self-injury, isolation and psychological manipulation.” The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
The attorney general also says the artificial intelligence “exposes minors to sexual conduct and/or exploitation, violence, drug, substance, and/or alcohol use, and other grave harms.” 
Coleman says “tens of thousands” of Kentuckians “actively log on to Character.AI, including thousands under the age of 18.” 
“The United States must be a leader in the development of AI, but it can’t come at the expense of our kids’ lives,” Coleman said in a statement. “Too many children – including in Kentucky – have fallen prey to this manipulative technology. Our Office is going to hold these companies accountable before we lose one more loved one to this tragedy.”
The complaint asserts that the company’s chatbots have posed as mental health professionals and “are providing minors with mental health advice without any professional degree.” It also accuses the technology of inappropriate “discussion of sexually explicit content, pedophilia, suicide and self-harm, eating disorders, bullying/harassment and illegal drug use and substance and/or alcohol use.”
The Kentucky General Assembly, which gaveled in Tuesday for the 2026 legislative session, has expressed interest in regulating AI. The Kentucky Artificial Intelligence Task Force has met over the last two interim sessions to look at ways to protect minors and address concerns around data centers, among other issues. 
Recommendations to come out of the 2025 task force include: 

Acknowledge that AI technology may be harmful to minors and consider legislative policies for the protection of minors on social media platforms.
Acknowledge that AI may impact careers regulated by professional standards, and consider legislative policies in coordination with professional standards boards to discuss when and how AI should be used within their profession.
Consider legislative policies for data centers’ need for large amounts of water and power requiring more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency, including consultation with the Public Service Commission.

Donna Boley, R-Pleasants, who is the longest continuously serving senator in state history, resigned from the Legislature on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia State Sen. Donna Boley, R-Pleasants, who is the longest continuously serving senator in state history, resigned from the Legislature on Thursday citing a need to focus more on her family and health, according to a news release from the state Senate.
Boley, who turned 90 years old in December, was first appointed to the state Senate in 1985 by former Gov. Arch Moore. She’s served continuously since then, winning every election she ran in for her seat.
In a resignation letter sent to Senate President Randy Smith on Thursday, Boley said she was stepping away with “a heavy, but grateful, heart.” Her resignation is effective immediately.
“It has been the honor of my life to represent Pleasants County and the Third Senatorial District for more than 40 years. I would not have been able to do that without the support of my constituents who chose to elect me 11 times,” Boley wrote in her resignation letter. “To all of you, the words ‘thank you’ are not enough. I will be forever grateful and proud to have been your voice in Charleston, and I enjoyed my time in service to you.”
Boley held numerous leadership positions during her decades in the Legislature. From 1991 to 1997, she served as the minority leader in the Senate when Democrats controlled the body. For two of those years — 1991 and 1992 — she was the lone Republican in the 34-member body. Those years, she worked as the minority chair for every single Senate committee.
Since 2015, she’s served as president pro tempore for the body. 
In statements Thursday, Smith said it was “hard to find the words to honor” Boley’s years of service, where she brought an “energy that few could ever match.”
“She stood as a strong conservative voice in the Senate, even when she was the only conservative voice. Her institutional knowledge and her ability to work with all people — no matter their politics — is an inspiration to us all,” Smith said. “She’s truly one of a kind. I’m blessed to not only call her my fellow Senator, but my friend. We will miss her every day, but I am so happy to know my friend Donna will be enjoying her retirement surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren she loves so much.”
During a call with reporters on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she could not say “enough great things” about Boley, who was first appointed to the Legislature by Capito’s father. Capito called Boley a “great mentor” and a “strong woman” who served her constituents “honorably and bravely.”
“I think [Boley’s service] tells everybody, men and women, that a strong woman can do anything when she sets her mind to it, because that’s what Donna Boley did,” Capito said. “I hope that she is OK. I’m concerned about her and I certainly will follow up with her and her family, but I wish her good wishes, and thank her for the many, many years of service and the many conversations and fun times that we’ve had together.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey commended Boley’s dedication to her constituents, calling it “unparalleled.”
“Through the decades, she earned the trust of West Virginians and served with integrity,” Morrisey said. “I thank Sen. Boley for her extraordinary service. West Virginia is stronger thanks to her contributions.”
As Boley represents a multi-county district — made up of Wood, Ritchie, Pleasants and Wirt counties — a committee will be formed by one man and one woman from each county, who will be responsible for submitting three names to Morrisey for people to fill the now-vacant seat. The committee has until Jan. 23 to submit those names and Morrisey will then have five days after they are submitted to choose a successor for Senate District 3.
The 2026 regular legislative session will begin on Jan. 14.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Army National Guard/Sgt. Ian Doyle)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster overstepped his bounds in sending National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., a Navy veteran and nonprofit watchdog agency claimed in a lawsuit filed in state court.
The lawsuit announced Thursday asks the state Supreme Court to reverse McMaster’s deployment last month of 300 troops to Washington and stop him from sending any more National Guard members to the capital or any other state under the initiative launched by President Donald Trump to combat what he called a “crime emergency.”
Soldiers left in early December for a 90-day deployment. It was the second time in six months that McMaster sent National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Following a request from the Pentagon, a first cohort of 200 service members left for the capital in August and returned in September. Maj. Gen. Robin Stilwell is also named in the lawsuit. As adjutant general, he leads the state’s military force and reports to the governor.
A similar lawsuit filed in West Virginia regarding that state’s National Guard deployment was dismissed in November. A circuit court judge ruled Gov. Patrick Morrisey acted lawfully under West Virginia law.
McMaster’s office contends the South Carolina governor also has broad authority to deploy state National Guard troops.
Decades-old South Carolina law says the governor can do so to counteract “war, insurrection, rebellion, invasion, tumult, riot or a mob,” whenever a large violent group is working together to break state or U.S. laws, if there’s imminent threat of that happening, or in response to a public disaster.
The lawsuit, however, contends none of those situations is happening in Washington.
Instead, “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful,” as the president coined the deployment, has National Guard members acting as routine law enforcement officers, according to attorneys for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and nonprofit Democracy Forward Foundation.

Complaint -- Final (1) 
South Carolina soldiers’ “primary mission is to provide critical support to law enforcement agencies, reinforcing safety and security for residents, workers, and visitors in the nation’s capital,” the adjutant general’s office said in a statement ahead of the December deployment. During the August deployment, troops patrolled transit stations, events and popular tourist destinations, the office said last month.
The capital city didn’t need the help, and the mayor didn’t ask for it, attorneys for the ACLU argue.
Total violent crime in Washington throughout 2024 fell 35% from the prior year, marking a 30-year low, the U.S. Department of Justice reported ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, accuses McMaster of using National Guard troops “as pawns in a harmful political gambit brought about by the President’s desire to militarize the nation’s cities.”
Sending South Carolina’s troops to another state means less help if a disaster happens at home, the lawsuit argues. That’s a problem for people like Navy veteran James Weninger, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a resident of coastal Berkeley County, according to the lawsuit.
“South Carolina’s National Guardsmen should not be asked to undertake illegal deployments or be used to score political points by our government,” Weninger said in a statement.
SC sends 300 National Guard troops to DC in second deployment rotation

Trump asked governors to activate troops under what is known as a Title 32 agreement, which means the federal government pays for the costs of deployment, but the governor keeps control over the guardsmen.
In response to criticism last summer about sending the troops amid hurricane season, McMaster said he’d bring them back if a hurricane or other natural disaster threatened the state.
The guard also said the mission does not diminish its ability to respond to in-state emergencies. The National Guard in South Carolina includes about 9,200 Army National Guard and 1,300 Air National Guard members, according to the guard.
Brandon Charochak, McMaster’s spokesman, said South Carolina governors have “unambiguous authority to utilize and deploy the state’s National Guard to save and protect American lives, defend the homeland, and assist in enforcing the rule of law.
“To suggest otherwise demonstrates either a remarkable ignorance of constitutional and statutory law, or a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” he said in a statement.
South Carolina’s troops joined around 1,500 more from nine other states, along with local National Guard members, to patrol Washington, D.C., starting last August.
Attorneys in the South Carolina case want to skip the lower courts entirely. The ACLU and Democracy Forward asked the state Supreme Court to take up the case directly, citing its public importance and immediacy. Attorneys also asked for a speedy hearing.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A popular pandemic-era subsidy program that has helped offset the cost of child care for families and providers will end in April, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services announced.  
The state agency said the COVID-era program, which provides a $5 per child, per day subsidy to child care providers, will end April 6. 
“This temporary enhancement was funded through time-limited federal pandemic resources that are no longer available,”a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Sharing this update now is meant to give families and providers time to plan ahead.”
The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma, which represents providers, said in a statement that the industry relies on these subsidies and that the cuts “will directly impact families and the availability of child care statewide.”
A spokesperson said in a statement that providers rely on the $5 subsidy to cover “rising wages, utilities, food and insurance.” 
“These changes return child care funding to pre-COVID levels, despite the fact that operating costs are dramatically higher than they were before the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “Providers are already operating on razor-thin margins, and many say these cuts will force closures, reduce enrollment, or push families out of care entirely.”
The announcement that the program will end entirely comes after DHS last year said that one-time federal relief funding had been exhausted, and that the agency could no longer afford to fund the full program. New applications and renewals for many school-age children ended Nov. 1. 
The Licensed Child Care Association in December sued DHS in Oklahoma County District Court, seeking an emergency injunction that would require the agency to continue to pay the $5 per day subsidy for school-age children. A judge declined to immediately order DHS to fully restore the pandemic-era subsidy program, but litigation in the case continues. 
DHS said this week that the receipt of partial federal funding will allow it to resume paying the subsidies for children ages 6 to 8 until the program ends in April, but the pause on the subsidy remains in place for children 9 and up. Exceptions remain for children in foster care, adoptions, children with disabilities, experiencing homelessness or whose families are receiving emergency financial assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, according to the news release. 
In July, further changes will be made to subsidy eligibility for Oklahoma families. Income eligibility will be 55% of the state median income, down from 85%. This is a return to pre-pandemic guidelines, according to the release. 
“Together, these updates help strengthen the child care subsidy program by expanding support where funding allows and making thoughtful adjustments over time,” a spokesperson for DHS said in a statement. “Our goal is a more stable, predictable program that families and providers can rely on today and in the years ahead.”
Child care providers have expressed concern that losing these subsidies will cause facilities to close, which could harm rural communities where child care deserts are more prominent.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Democratic Fulton County commissioner who blocked Republican election board nominees in defiance of a judge’s order is running to become Georgia’s next secretary of state.
Commissioner Dana Barrett announced her candidacy Thursday. Georgia’s secretary of state has a number of duties, including overseeing elections and granting business licenses.
Barrett won her seat representing the Buckhead, Sandy Springs and Midtown areas in 2022 after defeating a longtime Republican incumbent. Prior to her election, she worked as a tech executive, radio host and small business owner.
In August, Barrett and another commissioner defied a judge’s order and refused to approve two Republican nominees to the county election board that the Democratic commissioners called extremists and election deniers. A judge levied a daily $10,000 fine against the board of commissioners, but the fines are on hold while an appeal is being considered.
Speaking at an Atlanta independent bookstore Thursday, Barrett characterized herself as the best candidate to stand up against the Trump administration.
“This past summer, I was threatened with jail time when I said no to the MAGA extremists trying to stack the board with election deniers,” she said. “We’ve stopped them for now, but the fight is not over. I said then that I cannot and I will not hand our elections over to extremists and election deniers who think that their voices are more important than yours.”
The Georgia secretary of state’s office entered the spotlight after the 2020 election when  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, refused President Donald Trump’s request to “find” enough missing votes to overturn his loss in the state.
Barrett characterized that refusal as “the bare minimum” and criticized Raffensperger’s support for Georgia’s 2021 election overhaul.
She said her experience as a businesswoman has prepared her to serve small business owners and her tech background will help her protect Georgia’s election system from cyber threats and protect Georgians from scams.
Raffenspreger is running for Georgia governor this year, and the lack of an incumbent has attracted a number of candidates from both parties who have also declared plans to replace Raffensperger.
In the Democratic primary in May, Barrett is set to square off against rivals including former TV judge and Biden administration official Penny Brown Reynolds and voting rights advocate Adrian Consonery Jr. The winner will return to face the victor in the Republican primary in November.
On the GOP side, state Rep. Tim Fleming; former state Rep. Vernon Jones, Kelvin King, a businessman and husband to state election board member Janelle King, as well as former state election official Gabriel Sterling, a top Raffensperger aide, have all announced their candidacies.

Ole Miss avenged that loss a week ago in the Sugar Bowl.
Rick Cleveland
Frankly, I thought the Fiesta Bowl betting line would be the other way around with the Rebels a slight favorite over the Hurricanes.
Of course, the oddsmakers set the betting line in an attempt to attract equal money bet on both teams – not because they believe Miami is 3.5 points better than Ole Miss. Georgia, by the way, was a 6.5 point pick over Ole Miss last week. Miami was an underdog in both of its playoff games. Underdogs have won four of six playoff games thus far. Power conference underdogs are a perfect 4-0.
There is a recency bias at work here with the Miami-Ole Miss betting line. Miami is a white-hot football team, having closed the regular season with four consecutive convincing victories, followed by two impressive playoffs victories. The Hurricanes won at Texas A&M in the opening round slugfest and then stunned defending national champ and second-ranked Ohio State 24-14 in the Cotton Bowl. That was the biggest upset in playoff history with Miami a 9.5-point underdog.
Miami dominated Ohio State for most of the game, leading 14-0 at halftime. When Ohio State looked to be mounting a second half comeback, the Hurricanes just mauled the Buckeyes at the line of scrimmage offensively, much the way they had Texas A&M in the opening round. Color me surprised if the Hurricanes don’t try and do the same to Ole Miss. The Miami offensive line is as massive as it is effective. Miami running back Mark Fletcher is a 225-pound bruiser who pushes the pile and breaks tackles. He is a load.

This isn’t exactly breaking news here, but Ole Miss must first stop the run to have a chance to stop Miami. Accomplish that, and then the Rebels have to deal with quarterback Carson Beck’s passing. Beck, a multi-million dollar transfer portal acquisition, is a classic drop-back, pro-style passer who is quite accurate when he has a clean pocket. As with 99% of quarterbacks, Beck becomes much more average when he has defenders in his face.
And that was the case on Nov. 9, 2024, when Pete Golding’s Ole Miss defense sacked him five times in the Rebels’ 28-10 victory over Georgia. Beck was limited to 181 yards passing and zero touchdowns, and he threw one interception.
The Ole Miss defensive staff believes Beck has better weapons around him and a better line in front of him at Miami than he had last season at Georgia. Still, it can’t be over-emphasized that the Rebels’ first task is to stop Fletcher and the powerful Miami running game.
Now then, let’s look at the matchup when Ole Miss is on offense. Miami’s defensive front might be the nation’s best. Defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have been racing one another to get to the quarterback. The Hurricanes totaled seven sacks against A&M and then five against Ohio State. Miami leads the nation with 46 sacks on the season.
Contrast that with this: Trinidad Chambliss has not been sacked a single time in two playoffs games. Part of that is due to good protection, but much of it is due to this: Chasing Chambliss is one thing, catching him is another. On many of his drop backs against Georgia, he made like Houdini, escaping the rush when there did not seem an escape available.
You ask me, Chambliss is the X-factor in this game. He makes plays when no plays seem available. He will have to make some of those kinds of plays Thursday night for Ole Miss to advance to the national championship game.
But guess what: Chambliss has been doing it week, after week, after week. His consistency has been astounding, as his 21 passing touchdowns compared to just three pass interceptions attest. This will be his toughest task to date. The Miami defense ranks in the top 10 in every major statistical category. The Hurricanes can smother you.
Both teams are sound in the kicking game. Both have excellent placekicker, although give Ole Miss the edge in field goal range. Lucas Carneiro makes 50-yard-plus field goals look easy.
Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. CST on ESPN.
A prediction: Ole Miss 34, Miami 31. Chambliss makes a game-changing play and Carneiro makes a game-winning kick.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28184542/AP25332676333925.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

Andy Beshear told reporters the shooting of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis was “foreseeable,” “preventable” and “tragic.” 
The governor also called the Trump administration’s response to the shooting “grossly irresponsible,” when asked about the incident in a Thursday press conference.

Other Kentucky politicians, including U.S. Senate candidates, also reacted to reports of the shooting — either condemning the officer or criticizing the victim for not following orders from law enforcement. 
The Lantern’s sister outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, reported that an ICE officer fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Nicole Good, who was driving an SUV through her car window in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. She was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
A witness told Minnesota Public Radio that ICE agents gave conflicting instructions to Good, who was driving a maroon SUV, with one agent telling her to move out of the way. Video obtained by the Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding that Good get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting.
Beshear criticized the Trump administration on Thursday for “encouraging ICE to act aggressively across the nation” by celebrating raids via social media and videos. 
“I’ve never seen a government agency push a group of law enforcement to be as aggressive and use the words of aggressiveness that I have with what is being pushed out there on ICE,” Beshear said. 
Beshear said typically in shootings that involve officers “we say we need to make sure we get through this investigation because each one has to be investigated by law enforcement.” He criticized U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for calling Good a “‘domestic terrorist’ without getting the results from law enforcement” and President Donald Trump for his false statements on social media, including that Good had “violently, willfully, and viciously” run over an ICE agent.“This is a U.S. citizen. That’s supposed to be her president,” Beshear said. 
The Reformer reported Thursday that the FBI ousted the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation, according to the official leading the Minnesota agency. 
Beshear also had a message for ICE officers, saying that they “take oaths of office” and are “required to follow the law.” 
“I’d encourage them to do their job the right way,” he said. “They’re not a member of the military. They are a member of a form of law enforcement inside the United States.” 
The governor called Good’s death “tragic.” Good was a 37-year-old mother of three who had recently moved to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
“We’ve got to go about this entirely different than we are right now,” Beshear said. “Yes, we need secure borders, but how we enforce our laws show our humanity or lack of it.” 
U.S. Senate candidates’ responses
Kentucky candidates for U.S. Senate also weighed in. 
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr said on X that “ICE agents are enforcing America’s laws and delivering exactly what Kentuckians voted for: a secure border and the deportation of dangerous illegal criminals.” 
“Targeting ICE agents will never end well for anyone who tries,” he added. 
Lexington businessman Nate Morris said on X that he “saw an ICE agent acting in self defense after being attacked by a leftwing agitator.” 
“Leftist radicals do not get a free pass to assault officers, obstruct deportations, or ignore lawful orders just because they’re upset that our immigration laws are finally being enforced,” Morris said. 
Former Attorney General Daniel Cameron wrote on X that police officers “take on difficult and dangerous work every day. There was a time when this was universally understood and law enforcement universally respected.” 
“We must return to a standard where following lawful orders is viewed as a civic duty rather than an option. When we do, everyone is safer,” he said. 
On the Democratic side, Charles Booker, who previously worked in the Beshear administration, made a public call to “abolish and prosecute ICE” online. 
“This is ridiculous,” he said. 
Amy McGrath, former Marine fighter pilot, said on X it was “pretty clear” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Noem had “been lying about this horrific killing from the start.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents will not meet Friday to decide whether to proceed with an $800 million deal with Clarkson Regional Health Services for a controlling stake in the future of Nebraska Medicine.
The regents were set to meet at 3 p.m. Friday. They will now meet at 9 a.m. next Thursday. Thirty-one state lawmakers also sent a letter Thursday urging the regents to “tap the brakes” and delay the vote.
“We have an obligation to understand that at a higher level out of just good stewardship for taxpayers,” said State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who led the letter.

The Thursday letter says the public and the Legislature have had “very limited visibility” to understand the full implications of the deal, which was made public less than a week ago. 
Von Gillern said NU is a creation of the state with a large portion of state funding. Yet, many senators don’t yet “clearly understand” the deal.
“Even some of us who have dug into it deeply don’t yet have a clear understanding of the potential impact to taxpayers,” said von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee.
Specifics of the deal
The deal would authorize NU President Jeffrey Gold to proceed with a plan to buy out Clarkson’s $500 million share of the NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership. Another $300 million would be used to purchase Clarkson properties near the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus in midtown Omaha. Gold has described the deal as an “amicable separation and divorce,” and said it’s now up to deciding custody.

Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of UNMC. The Nebraska Medicine board opposes the transaction.
Related, Clarkson has pledged to give NU $200 million after the sale for the “Project Health” innovation project, and NU would also commit to operating Clarkson College for five years.
NU had no immediate comment on the lawmakers’ letter.
Joining von Gillern in the letter were State Sens. Bob Andersen, Beau Ballard, Eliot Bostar, Machaela Cavanaugh, John Cavanaugh, Stan Clouse, Wendy DeBoer, Barry DeKay, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Bob Hallstrom, Rick Holdcroft, Megan Hunt, Teresa Ibach, Mike Jacobson, Margo Juarez, Kathleen Kauth, Loren Lippincott, Dan Lonowski, Terrell McKinney, Mike Moser, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree, Tony Sorrentino, Ashlei Spivey, Tanya Storer, Paul Strommen and Dave Wordekemper.
The vote is expected to occur now without Regent Elizabeth O’Connor, who faces a formal article of impeachment in the Legislature. The Omaha regent announced Dec. 30 she would resign after Friday.

Gov. Jim Pillen would appoint her temporary replacement. His office confirmed it was not yet in possession of a resignation letter by 1:45 p.m. Thursday. Pillen supports the Clarkson transaction and could make an appointment to cinch another vote.
Von Gillern said he’s not taking a long-term positive or negative position on the vote but said more time might be more prudent to flesh out the issue.
The State of Nebraska currently faces a projected $471 million shortfall this budget cycle. Lawmakers control the state’s purse strings.
Negotiation complications
Gold, speaking at a faculty, staff and student forum Tuesday at UNMC, said the deal has been in the works since a few days after he became president in July 2024. However, because of “extremely rigid” nondisclosure agreements, the discussion couldn’t be public until last week.
“There will not be a single dollar of state appropriation, tuition, et cetera, or research funding or indirect cost recovery that goes into doing this,” Gold said Tuesday.
Gold said there is “not contemplation” by regents to financially micromanage the new system, noting certain powers already exist today. Regents also don’t plan to micromanage clinical care.
Regents are barreling ahead partly because if they don’t, Gold said the “exclusivity of negotiations” with the regents would lapse, and Clarkson would likely begin negotiating with out-of-state entities to pursue the deal.

Gold and Pillen, a former regent of 10 years, have said that’s a bad deal for Nebraska. Gold said Clarkson is “hellbent” on moving forward.
“They did not present this as a multiple-choice question,” Gold said. “It wasn’t a discussion about what could we do to stabilize this and retain the dual membership organizational structure, but that it was an inevitability.”
Gold said “we need to put this to rest as quickly as we possibly can and move on,” in part for the health of relationships among NU, Clarkson and Nebraska Medicine.
Von Gillern said he understands the nondisclosure agreements but estimated the negotiations could be a “low risk.” He said he’s not taking a position on the vote, which he said could end up being the “best” or “worst” deal NU makes, “but we don’t know yet.”
The Thursday letter ends: “We would urge you to postpone action on the $800 million proposed transaction to ensure all viable alternatives have been considered and until all stakeholders understand the impact of the proposal for the state and these two great institutions.”

The proposal would reduce the bench from five justices to three. Ultimately, lawmakers did not take any action. 
The post Lawmakers met privately about shrinking Wyoming Supreme Court following abortion ruling appeared first on WyoFile .","Hours after the Wyoming Supreme Court published its long-awaited ruling on two abortion bans — striking them down on account of the state’s constitution — lawmakers held a closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss next steps. Up for consideration, WyoFile has learned, was a dramatic change to the composition of the state’s highest court.
In Cheyenne, the Joint Appropriations Committee was gathered for the week to continue the budget hearings it began in December. It’s the committee’s responsibility to craft a budget bill ahead of next month’s legislative session. 
Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, requested an executive session — a private meeting that the public cannot watch. Another lawmaker offered an explanation. 
“And that executive session is to discuss the possible action … toward the judiciary in the budget,” House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said. 
Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, seconded the motion and a majority of the committee voted “aye.”
“Somebody be ready to throw a bean bag at anybody that comes in the door,” Bear said. 
Behind closed doors
The committee then privately discussed but did not take action on a proposal to reduce the Wyoming Supreme Court’s bench from five justices to three, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting told WyoFile. 
Sources also told WyoFile the discussion was in direct response to some members’ disapproval of the high court’s ruling that Wyoming’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional.  
One of the bans was a first in the nation. Sponsored by Senate Appropriations Chairman Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, the 2023 law prohibited the use of pills for abortion. The second ban, sponsored by Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, a Cody Republican who now leads the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, prohibited abortion but included an exception for pregnancies that were the result of incest or sexual assault.

The state’s high court ruled 4-1 that the two laws conflict with the Wyoming Constitution, which protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. 
Many of the committee’s members, including Angelos, Bear and Haroldson, are allies and members of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republican lawmakers that won control of the House in 2024. Last year, the caucus sharpened its critiques of the judiciary branch, alleging that the state’s process for selecting judges is shaped by “political insiders” and “left-wing institutional capture.”  
Upon Tuesday’s ruling, the caucus quickly took aim at the Wyoming Supreme Court, calling the ruling “a stain on the Wyoming judicial branch” in a statement. 
“After decades of liberal leadership in the governor’s office, the State Supreme Court has been filled with jurists who reject basic biology and human dignity,” the statement said. 
Lawmakers respond
WyoFile reached out to Angelos, Bear, Haroldson and Salazar about the decision to discuss behind closed doors whether to reduce the number of the state’s supreme court justices. It did not receive a response from Bear, Haroldson or Salazar before publication. 
When asked if she expected lawmakers to pursue cutting the high court’s bench and if she planned to support it, Rep. Angelos told WyoFile in an email that she “would never try to guess what 93 lawmakers choose to pursue.”
“They all represent vastly different people across the state and assuming my colleague’s intent would be akin to looking into a crystal ball,” she wrote. 
“However, outside of this issue there have been discussion over the last couple of years among several legislators who do not sit on this committee about judicial reform,” Angelos wrote. “This is a broad discussion that we as representatives are hearing frequently from constituents across the state.” 
As to why the discussion needed to take place in an executive session, Angelos pointed to state law. 
“As stated in Wyoming Open meeting laws, when we as a committee seek legal counsel executive session is permitted,” she wrote in an email. 
Lawmakers could, in theory, change the number of justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court. That decision would require approval in both the House and Senate — a tall order, particularly during a budget session when bills must clear an initial two-thirds vote. But among the lawmakers who discussed the idea are some of the more notable members of the Legislature, and the Freedom Caucus controls the lower chamber.
State law currently specifies that “the supreme court of Wyoming shall consist of five (5) justices,” while the Wyoming Constitution requires that the high court “consist of not less than three nor more than five justices as may be determined by the legislature.”
Out of step or on target?
While some lawmakers have suggested the judiciary is out of step with the public, polling suggests otherwise.
In 2024, the University of Wyoming surveyed residents ahead of that year’s general election. Among other things, it found that 41.5% of the state’s adults either strongly approve or approve of the way that Wyoming judges are handling their job. Another 45.1% neither approve nor disapprove, while 13.4% said they disapprove or strongly disapprove. 
The Wyoming Legislature, meanwhile, received a lower approval rating and a higher disapproval rating. 
More specifically, the survey found that 34.1% of the state’s adults either approve or strongly approve of the Wyoming Legislature’s handling of its job. Another 33.3% neither approve nor disapprove, while 32.7% said they disapprove or strongly disapprove. 
The same survey found a wide range of views on abortion restrictions among Wyomingites. About 31% approved of the kind of ban struck down by the high court, with another 10.5% supporting a total ban. Nearly 39% supported a woman always having the right to an abortion, with the remainder supporting abortion “after the need … has been clearly established.”
A spokesperson for the judiciary branch declined to comment. 
The 2026 budget session begins Feb. 9 in Cheyenne.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 20:25:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Save the Sound, Brookfield move to block pipeline expansion approval",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/iriquois-gas-pipeline-permit-block-deep/,Opponents filed a legal appeal to block CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from issuing a final permit to Iroquois Gas.,"Opponents of a proposed natural gas expansion project in the town of Brookfield filed a legal appeal on Wednesday to block the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from issuing a final permit to the project’s developers, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System.
The move came in a lawsuit alleging procedural errors by DEEP regarding the type of hearing that was scheduled this week for opponents to raise concerns about the project. 
It was also part of a larger campaign to stop Iroquois from expanding its existing compressor station in Brookfield, which will in turn allow the company to push more gas through its 414-mile pipeline. In July, DEEP issued draft permits indicating its support for the project.
In response to that decision, the town of Brookfield and the environmental group Save the Sound requested that DEEP hold an adjudicatory hearing that would give both parties an opportunity to challenge the permits under Connecticut’s Environmental Protection Act. Chiefly, they presented concerns that the new gas-fired compressors would release large amounts of pollutants and greenhouse gases, worsening local air quality. 
While the agency did agree to hold an public informational hearing, DEEP rejected the request for a more robust adjudicatory hearing, citing issues with the town and Save the Sound’s applications. Without such a hearing, opponents argue, they will be left without means to appeal the agency’s final decision.
The public hearing is scheduled to take place virtually on Thursday evening, starting at 5 p.m. 
“An informational public hearing is still important, and we still encourage everyone with concerns to show up,” said Jessica Roberts, an attorney for Save the Sound. “That being said, it does not provide the same rights that an adjudicatory hearing provides.”
While the lawsuit remains pending, the plaintiffs filed a motion on Wednesday for an injunction that would temporarily halt DEEP’s review of the permits for the new compressors. The New Britain Superior Court judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, had not ruled on the motion as of Thursday morning.
A DEEP spokesman declined to comment directly on the group’s request for an injunction this week.
Following Thursday’s hearing, the agency will continue to accept written comments regarding the permits for the compressor station until Jan. 15, according to the spokesman, Bill Flood. After that, he said the agency will review all comments and make a final decision on whether to issue or revise the permits.
The Iroquois Pipeline runs from upstate New York, across Connecticut and Long Island Sound before terminating in New York City. The proposed expansion, which involves upgrades to several compressor stations, would increase the capacity of the pipeline by 8.3%, or 125 million cubic feet a day. The project does not involve adding new sections of pipeline.
Ruth Parkins, a spokeswoman for Iroquois, said DEEP’s review of the the Brookfield compressor station is the last major permitting hurdle before work can get underway on the $272 million project. The project has already received the necessary permits from New York and federal regulators, she said. 
“We look forward to presenting the project at a public Informational Hearing that the DEEP has scheduled,” Parkins said in a statement. “This hearing, along with a public comment period that closes on January 15th,  concludes the many opportunities that the public has had to provide comment on the project over the years.”
The project has elicited intense local opposition in Brookfield — where the compressor station is located less than half a mile from a local middle school — as well as from environmental advocates who argue that the expansion of natural gas infrastructure conflicts with Connecticut’s long-term pledge to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Daniel Myers, a member of a local community group opposing the project, accused DEEP of hiding behind “procedural nonsense” to avoid public scrutiny of its permits. If the agency does decide to approve the project, he said it should require Iroquois to use electric compressors and other equipment that release fewer gasses into the air. (Myers’ group is not a party to the lawsuit brought by Brookfield and Save the Sound.)
“Our air quality in Fairfield County is some of the worst in the eastern seaboard, and [DEEP] has an obligation to avoid making it worse,” Myers said. “They’re permitting a thing that only makes it worse.” 
In November, nine activists were arrested after staging a sit-down protest in Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, urging his administration to reject the permits for the project.
Lamont, while not weighing in directly on Iroquois’ proposal, has been generally supportive of expanding pipelines as a way of increasing the supply of natural gas flowing into New England and alleviating winter price spikes. The Iroquois pipeline is connected to another proposed project, the Constitution Pipeline, that would carry natural gas from Pennsylvania to upstate New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117_SR_SunriseProtest_123-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Thursday she looks forward to an investigation into the shooting death of a Minnesota woman by an immigration enforcement agent this week.
Capito told West Virginia reporters Thursday morning she had seen video of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Good was shot through the window of her vehicle. Good, 37, has been described as a “legal observer” to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city. 
“First of all, I think it’s tough being an ICE agent, it’s tough carrying out our immigration laws, particularly in communities where they were in Minnesota where there’s a large immigrant community and broad pushback and fomented sort of protest to them,” Capito said. “Any loss of life is a tragedy. I think we see from the video there’s questions as to how all this happened and why it happened. 
“I look forward to the investigation that I believe President Trump has called for,” Capito said. “And I think that we’ll find the answers here. So I think that it’s tough to watch. It’s tough to watch.”
Capito made the comments in response to a question from West Virginia MetroNews during a press briefing with West Virginia reporters Thursday morning. 
Capito and the rest of West Virginia’s congressional delegation all voted in support of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which increased funding for anti-immigrant enforcement, detention and deportation to $170 billion over four years. Trump signed the bill into law July 4. 
The shooting and videos of it has sparked division between people like Minneapolis city officials who see Good as a victim and Trump administration officials who claim the officer was acting in self defense. Congressional Democrats have demanded an investigation into the shooting.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Dylan Maher)The Trump administration on Thursday announced Indiana as one of two new national drone test sites — a designation that could attract jobs and spending from the industry.
Sen. Todd Young, who spearheaded the effort to land the site, applauded the move.
“It means that we have the ability and the private companies and universities and military will have ability to fly drones in Indiana’s airspace, which in turn will lead to more research and development, military exercises, more commercial development of drones in the state of Indiana and ultimately more manufacturing of advanced drones in the state,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“From an economic development standpoint, it burnishes our reputation … as a cutting-edge state for excellence and innovation,” he added.
Oklahoma was chosen as the second new site, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s website.
“From delivering lifesaving medicine to surveying pipelines, drones are already reshaping industries and changing how people and products interact. It’s our job to make sure the United States safely leads the way with this exciting technology – not China,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news release. “We’ve added these new test sites to help us gather critical data and test new systems so we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”
Young and the entire Hoosier congressional delegation expressed support for a bid from the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and the Applied Research Institute as the FAA expands its Unmanned Aircraft System Test Site program.
The federal agency currently designates seven drone test sites in Alaska, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia.

Young said the site will also mean more training opportunities for the Indiana National Guard and other military who come here to train, plus spillover economic benefits to communities that host them — and, high-paying jobs for Hoosiers.
“This sort of work is high-tech, precise and the demand signal is very strong for these best-in-class drones right now,” the senator said. “But not so high-tech that regular Hoosiers who are high school graduates with a certificate from community college couldn’t land them.”
He said it will take about six months to establish the site’s boundaries. It will be a wide swath encompassing Purdue University and southern Indiana.
Universities and military assets were emphasized in Indiana’s application.
The December letter of support pointed to Purdue University, which lawmakers noted has “the first university-owned airport in the country, the largest indoor motion capture facility in the world, and a faculty dedicated to addressing the challenges of safely integrating UAS into the national airspace.”
Indiana’s congressional delegation unites behind FAA drone test site bid

Highlighted, too, was Indiana’s Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, which in August “demonstrated the ability to neutralize a 49-drone swarm with a single electromagnetic pulse,” as well as testing space at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center and counter-UAS work at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
Young said he was not concerned that Indiana’s failed redistricting effort would stall federal benefits to the state.
“I just continued to look forward and do my work, having confidence that President (Donald) Trump and the administration would be professional in their selection process and I’m glad they have been,” he said.
Young first pushed the site designation when meeting when then-FAA administrator nominee Bryan Bedford in June.
State-level coordination is additionally part of the argument.
The letter referenced Gov. Mike Braun’s Oct. 29 executive order establishing a statewide drone task force.
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security. The task force must deliver a strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31.
Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level, helped Braun craft the executive order.

The two awards are part of $256 million in Education Innovation and Research grant funding announced by the U.S. Department of Education in December. More than 65% of the awards, totaling more than $167 million, will support projects in rural areas, according to a news release from the federal agency.
Arkansas receives $1 million grant to support high-impact tutoring

Ten of the 24 awards went to state education agencies, the largest number of such state-led literacy grants awarded. Arkansas was the only state receiving multiple awards, according to a news release from the state agency. 
“These federal investments affirm the work Arkansas has undertaken to build strong literacy foundations for every student,” Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in the release. “Through the LEARNS Act and targeted statewide initiatives, we have focused on early literacy, high-quality instruction, and support for students who need it most. These grants allow us to expand and deepen that work, particularly in rural communities.”
The LEARNS Act is a 2023 law that made sweeping changes to the state’s K-12 education system. Efforts to support literacy-related elements of the law include high-impact tutoring grants, increased literacy tutoring support of up to $1,500 for K-3 students who need additional assistance, literacy coaches for struggling schools and a policy prohibiting students who don’t meet the state’s third-grade reading standard from being promoted to fourth grade.
One of the federal grants awarded to Arkansas, worth nearly $15 million, will be used to evaluate high-impact tutoring initiatives at rural schools. The project will be used in partnership with Air Reading, a California-based company that provides virtual tutoring, and include an independent evaluation by Stanford University. 
The second grant, worth nearly $10 million, will be used to study a program that teaches early literacy skills in partnership with the University of Florida Literacy Institute.

,DC,2026-01-08 20:10:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Maybe, just maybe, there’s not another shutdown looming at the end of January",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maybe-just-maybe-theres-not-another-shutdown-looming-end-january,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress are cautiously optimistic they can enact the remaining government funding bills before their deadline at the end of the month, avoiding another shutdown. The milestone would represent an accomplishment for the typically gridlocked Congress, though it comes months after lawmakers’ original October deadline and the longest shutdown in history that reverberated throughout the country.  Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said recently negotiators are making “progress” toward agreement on the unresolved bills, which include funding for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security.Those three bills are the most complicated to resolve and this year will be no exception given President Donald Trump’s actions on immigration, deportation and military intervention in Venezuela. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the committee, was somewhat less optimistic than her colleague about the likelihood all of the bills become law. But she didn’t rule it out. “It's up to the Republican leadership,” Murray said. “We're working hard to get our end of it done.”House approves some spendingCongress approved three of the dozen annual spending bills in the package that ended the shutdown in November, providing funding for their own offices and operations; military construction projects; the Agriculture Department; and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The package provided stopgap spending for the remaining federal programs in the other nine bills. The House voted Thursday to approve the Energy-Water, Commerce-Justice-Science and Interior-Environment spending bills, sending them to the Senate, where Collins expects that chamber will take a procedural vote Monday. Collins said the remaining six unresolved bills will likely move through Congress in two separate packages — one funding financial services, homeland security, the State Department and foreign operations as well as one funding defense, education, health care, housing and transportation programs. If Congress finishes work on the full slate of bills, which will likely account for about $1.8 trillion in spending, it would mark the end of the first annual appropriations process of Trump’s second term in office.Minnesota ICE shooting jolts processThe biggest hurdle to completing work on all of the bills will be reaching consensus on funding for the Homeland Security Department, especially after an immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. Collins said a day after the Jan. 7 incident that members of both political parties in both chambers continue to work on the bill and praised subcommittee Chairwoman Katie Britt of Alabama for “doing a really good job.”Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, ranking member on the subcommittee, however, said there must be “constraints” on how immigration agents are operating. Murphy said the sharp increase in hiring at Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, spurred by billions in additional funding included in Republicans’ big, beautiful bill, “likely resulted in people being out there on our streets who don't have the necessary training.”“Now I'm not saying that's part of the story yesterday, but we know that they are not applying the same standards and the same training that they have in the past,” Murphy said. “There's a broader question about whether CBP is qualified to operate in the interior at all. From my understanding, CBP was part of that deployment yesterday that resulted in the murder of this young woman.""Murphy said he has a “handful of ideas” about how to address his and other Democrats' concerns about how the Trump administration has approached immigration enforcement, while acknowledging any final agreement will need Republican support to move through Congress. “I won't be asking for the moon. We're not going to fix all of these issues. And I'm not looking for comprehensive immigration reform at all,” Murphy said. “But some targeted improvements in the way that ICE and CBP are operating, I think, are going to be necessary.”Murphy said he believes there is time to work out a bipartisan solution on that spending bill before the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a press conference that the leaders on the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee are having an “important and serious discussion” about the funding bill after the shooting. Congress could pass a stopgap spending bill for programs within the Homeland Security Department, which includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to keep everything up and running for the rest of the fiscal year. The fall-back option can be used when consensus on a full-year bill isn’t possible. That type of funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, would keep DHS’ funding mostly flat and avoid the need for it to shut down after the current funding law expires at the end of the month. It would leave in place the types of policies that DHS has been operating under all year. Negotiations continueHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Wednesday talks on the unsettled bills are “going well” and that she expects lawmakers to meet their Jan. 30 deadline.House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said his “goal” is to approve the leftover bills before the end of the month, avoiding the need for Congress to use another stopgap measure to keep the government up and running or face a shutdown. While the groupings Collins outlined may seem random, Cole said appropriators spent a good bit of time contemplating how to package the remaining bills. “There was a lot of thought given to how to work these things together and what would maximize support on each side,” Cole said. “Obviously, those discussions were had not just amongst Republicans but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other chamber. So we think that's the best package to move forward.” Congress rarely approves the final versions of the government funding bills one-by-one and used to approve all 12 in one omnibus package, though Republican opposition to that has led to smaller “minibuses.”Cole said negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on final versions of the full-year spending bills are being undertaken by subcommittee leaders. “If you can solve these problems at the subcommittee level, you've got the most knowledgeable people, the people that care the most on both sides of the aisle,” Cole said. “The further up the food chain it goes — whether to my colleagues in the four corners (of the Appropriations Committee) or to leadership — the more political decisions come, and the less knowledgeable the people making the decision are about the topic.”Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the top Democrat on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said that “great progress” had been made so far toward final agreement on that bill.“I'm very hopeful and encouraged, given the work that's been done so far, that we can do that,” Baldwin said. Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy cast doubt on his colleagues’ ability to reach consensus on the last six bills, saying it will be “difficult” to work out final agreements in the time left. “I wouldn't bet my house on it,” Kennedy said. “And if I were betting your house, it would be just a maybe.”Kennedy said he isn’t involved in the negotiations on those bills but expects negotiators are “fighting over something.” Kennedy is chairman of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which already completed work on its bill. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Court System is preparing to finalize new ethics guidelines that will determine whether state judges must opt out from hearing cases due to personal conflicts.
An extensive new ethics code, modeled on a national standard drafted by the American Bar Association, is open for public comment through Jan. 23. 
The changes, which stretch for dozens of dense, jargon-filled pages, prescribe things like what a judge can ethically do during an election, how to respond if someone’s life might be endangered by secrecy and even what happens if an attorney is drunk in the courtroom.
“The primary purpose in my mind … is so a judge can look at it to determine whether what the judge is thinking about doing or is being asked to do is ethical,” said former Alaska Chief Justice Daniel Winfree, a key member of the committee that has been working on the redraft since 2018.
That predates recent concerns over the ethical standards used by the U.S. Supreme Court, whose members have been accused of accepting excessive gifts from people with issues in front of the court.
Alaska’s existing code of ethics dates to 1998 and was based on a model released in 1990 by the American Bar Association.
The association released a new model code in 2007, but Alaska didn’t adopt it. In 2018, as the court system dealt with a rising number of Alaskans representing themselves in court, judges were struggling with what they could and couldn’t do to help, Winfree said.
He suggested adopting part of the new model code to help with the issue.
“And all of a sudden, it got morphed into, ‘Well, we haven’t looked at the entire (code) since the whole thing changed. And so, would you like to chair a committee?’”
Winfree’s been working on the new code since then, continuing even after his retirement from the Alaska Supreme Court in 2023.
“It took a lot longer than I would have expected,” he said.
The code was supposed to become effective in April, but Winfree and others in the court system wanted a longer public comment period. It’s now scheduled for October 2026, time enough to make changes and fix any issues raised through public comments, according to Winfree.
The code applies to members of the Alaska Supreme Court, district court judges and superior court judges, but not magistrates, who are covered by the Alaska Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Federal U.S. District Court Judge Joshua Kindred resigned from Alaska’s federal courts in 2024 after an investigation found significant misconduct. He was later disbarred by the Alaska Supreme Court.
Kindred was a federal judge, not a state one, but the new draft gives a nod to his misconduct.
As Winfree explained, the new code “makes clear that judges are supervisors and that they have other obligations as supervisors than just an obligation to not be a bad person.”
Winfree said that as public comments arrive, the drafting committee will examine each one to consider whether changes need to be made to the existing draft code. 
“Depending on how many comments there are, we’ll probably have a couple of meetings with the Supreme Court to go over each of these things, make final changes, and then go to print,” he said.
“It’s a huge project. We’ll be so happy when it’s done, I bet.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC01376-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes will run for state insurance commissioner, vowing to decline any campaign contributions from the insurance industry.
Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, announced her intention Thursday to challenge House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a previously uncontested Republican from Wichita with decades of experience in insurance.
She described a platform focused on lowering costs, consumer protection and holding “big insurance companies accountable.”
“It’s simple: The cost of health insurance in Kansas is simply out of control,” Sykes said in the announcement. “Families and consumers can’t afford to keep up with the rise in premiums — on health care, auto, property or any other kind of insurance for that matter.”
She said she will not “take a single dime from the insurance industry.”
Sykes was elected to the Senate in 2016 as a Republican, switching parties during her first term. She was elected minority leader in 2020 and has held the position since. Before her tenure in the Legislature, Sykes ran her own business as a personal chef and a PTA president. She is a mother to two boys and married.
Hawkins announced his candidacy in May, rooting it in conservative values and deregulating the state’s insurance marketplace, which he speculated could lower costs and make insurance easier to navigate.
The insurance commissioner oversees the Kansas Insurance Department, which regulates insurance companies operating in the state. The current commissioner, Vicki Schmidt, is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
Hawkins said in a statement he and Sykes have a good working relationship, and he welcomed a spirited campaign. But, he said, “we arrive at things from a very different perspective politically and quite frankly, fiscally.” He said his focus is on increasing competition, easing marketplace navigation issues and ensuring people are not wrongly denied coverage.
He liked Sykes’ policy focus to “Zohran Mamdani-like woke politics,” referencing the newly elected Democratic mayor of New York City.
Former insurance commissioner and Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and former insurance commissioner Sandy Praeger, a Republican, threw their support behind Sykes.
“As long as I’ve known Dinah, she’s stood up for what’s right and fought for Kansas families,” Sebelius said in the announcement.
Praeger said Sykes is a practical leader, focused on garnering results over partisanship.
“Kansans want leaders who will listen to them and fight against unfair and discriminatory practices by the industry,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC022559-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Wilson to a vacant state Senate seat on Jan. 8, 2026. (Courtesy Chaves County Commission)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday appointed Rex Wilson, a former healthcare administrator and longtime rancher, to assume a vacant state Senate seat ahead of the upcoming legislative session.
Wilson will represent Senate District 33, following the resignation of Alamogordo Republican Nicholas Paul last fall due to health issues. Wilson will serve the remainder of the term until the Nov. 3, 2026 general election.
Because Senate District 33 covers part of Chaves, Lincoln and Otero counties, all three commissions met to consider and submit nominees to the governor. 
Wilson was one of three candidates county commissions put forward for the governor’s consideration.Chaves County’s commission nominated Wilson; Lincoln County commissioners nominated their commission chair, Mark Fischer; and Otero County picked current state Rep. John Block (R-Alamogordo).
Southeastern NM counties submit three names to fill vacant NM Senate seat

Wilson told Source New Mexico on Thursday that he is eager to get to work, namely on healthcare and agricultural issues, though he did not have any plans as of Thursday to introduce legislation or co-sponsor any particular bills. 
“I don’t come with a loaded agenda,” he said. “More than anything is, just get acquainted and build the right relationships in this session and make a difference.”
He also said he is eager to work with Republicans and Democrats in the majority, particularly on health care issues. “I’m a conservative, but also a realist,” he said. 
Wilson was the Southern region healthcare administrator at Presbyterian Medical Service until 2024 and touts 18 years of healthcare experience, according to a cover letter he presented to county commissions. He is also a multigenerational rancher in Lincoln County who was the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association Cattleman of the Year in 2017. 
Citing health, NM GOP senator resigns after less than a year in office

He also founded Camp Sierra Blanca at Fort Stanton, a “nationally recognized alternative education model” that gives troubled young people a “second chance through non-traditional pathways,” he said in his cover letter.
Wilson’s arrival at the Senate maintains Republicans’ 16 seats in the chamber. Democrats currently hold 26 seats.
Sen. Bill Sharer, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement that Wilson’s “contributions in the Legislature will benefit every New Mexican and he will make a great addition to our New Mexico Senate Republican Caucus.”
The state Republican Party earlier this week criticized Lujan Grisham for not having filled the seat following Paul’s mid-October resignation. In a news release, the party noted the upcoming Jan. 12 deadline for capital outlay requests and said the delayed appointment created a disadvantage for whomever the governor chose “in their efforts to represent their constituents in southern New Mexico.”
Wilson told Source that he did not think the governor unnecessarily delayed his appointment. 
“I do know they did their homework. I’ll just say that,” he said of the governor’s office. “I don’t think there was any strategy behind it other than just doing their homework.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.13-PM-1024x586.png,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

The governor just announced Elon Musks’s company, xAI, is investing over $20 billion in the state to build a new data center and power plant in Southaven. This is the largest single investment in the state’s history, Reeves said, and is the fifth data center complex in the state.
“This is an exciting day for Mississippi’s kids and for Mississippi’s workforce and for Mississippi’s economy,” Gov. Tate Reeves said at an announcement live streamed from Southaven on X, formerly known as Twitter, owned by Musk.
The data center in De Soto County is the company’s third in the Memphis metropolitan area. This summer, xAI purchased an old power plant in Southaven where it is running 18 temporary gas turbines and plans to erect permanent turbines. 
Sen. Michael McClendon, a Republican who represents Southaven, said he welcomes the influx of investment to his district, but also has concerns about the impact such a project would have on natural resources in the area. 
“I’d say it’s a good thing,” McClendon said. “My only concern is the aquifers up there, how much water will be used, how much water gets replenished in those aquifers, is there any way that those will be damaged?” 
On Dec. 30, Musk posted on X that xAI had bought a warehouse in Southaven and planned to increase the company’s computing power.
The company will have 2 gigawatts of computing power in the Memphis area. 
“We’re going to do more,” said Anthony Armstrong, chief financial officer of xAI on Thursday during the announcement with Reeves. “It’s in large part because of the responsiveness and cooperation, governor, from your administration.
 Armstrong added that xAI wants its Memphis data center cluster to be the world’s largest supercomputer.
The artificial-intelligence boom has brought tens of billions of new investment to Mississippi. Local and state officials have welcomed these projects, citing benefits such as tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue and new jobs. The state also passed a data center tax incentive in 2024 that exempts companies from sales, use, corporate income and franchise taxes which xAI will be utilizing. 
“I’m not aware of any other state that even comes close to Mississippi in the scope of those subsidies,” said John Mozena, president of the Center for Economic Accountability. 
The Compass data center campus in Meridian was named the worst economic development deal of 2025. The Center who gave out the moniker cited extensive state tax breaks, little local economic impact and lack of transparency as some of the factors contributing to its decision. 
On Tuesday during a board of aldermen meeting, Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite confirmed xAI’s plans to build a data center citing conversations he’d had with the company. Musselwhite called the project “game changing,” adding that the new project would bring around 100 jobs to Southaven and increase the city’s tax revenue. 
Reeves said the center would bring thousands more indirect jobs.
The company has already faced pushback from some residents about the temporary gas turbines it is currently using and potential air pollution. The temporary turbines are less than a mile from a Southaven neighborhood and residents have reported the noise from the turbines has been disruptive. A petition by a local group, the Safe and Sound Coalition calls for the power plant to be shut down and has over 900 signatures.
“It feels like a slap in the face to every resident who’s been fighting for transparency around xAI’s power plant in Southaven,” said Shannon Samsa, a lifelong Southaven resident and cofounder of the Safe and Sound Coalition, “While the community has been kept in the dark for months, xAI is already expanding. Once again, the public wasn’t informed or given any say.”
Elon Musk was not in attendance for the announcement Thursday.

Mississippi poultry company Cal Maine, the nation’s largest producer of eggs, reported sales in the second quarter of FY 2026 were down 19.4% compared to FY 2025. Net sales were $769.5 million, compared to $954.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The company saw record sales last year due to an egg shortage.
On Wednesday, Open AI and Future Caucus held a workshop with Mississippi legislators about artificial intelligence and ways they could use it in their work. According to the company, 24% of Mississippi Chat GPT users are between the ages of 18 and 24. Open AI demonstrated potential uses of AI including responding to constituents’ letters and creating a custom chatbot. Legislators who attended had a wide range of questions from AI safety and how to spot fakes to the future of state regulation of AI.
The Mississippi Legislature is back in session. Ahead of the session, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann spoke about the ongoing challenges the agriculture industry faces at the Stennis Institute of Government Capitol Press forum. Hosemann proposed eliminating the 1.5% sales tax on agriculture equipment and said that he’s looking into alternative markets for soybeans.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Inspector General)West Virginia has a new foster care ombudsman tasked with reviewing concerns and complaints in the state’s overburdened child welfare system. 
Jessica Bryant, a former Child Protective Services worker, will serve as director of the Foster Care Ombudsman Division. 
“The Foster Care Ombudsman exists to ensure concerns are heard, reviewed fairly, and addressed independently,” Bryant said in a news release Thursday from the state’s Office of Inspector. “I am honored to serve in this role and committed to listening carefully to children, families, and caregivers, while identifying meaningful opportunities for improvement that strengthen the system as a whole.”
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia’s foster care system. 
Bryant plans to focus on clear communication, objective review of concerns and collaboration with child welfare partners while maintaining the independence and impartiality in the ombudsman’s role.
State lawmakers created the foster care ombudsman role in 2019 in an effort to bolster accountability in the troubled foster care system that has struggled with high CPS case loads, a lack of safe homes for children and communication to those involved in a child’s case.
Along with investigating complaints from foster parents and children, the ombudsman was tasked with advocating for the rights of children and families. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a bill clarifying that the foster care ombudsman would work impartially under the state’s Office of Inspector General. There had been concerns that the role wasn’t able to work independently without interference from foster care officials.
Bryant previously worked in oversight roles within CPS focused on reviewing complaints, assessing compliance and identifying systemic issues.
She is also a kinship caregiver to a child involved in the foster care system, which “shaped her commitment to transparency, timely responses and respectful engagement with families navigating complex systems,” the news release said.
“Jessica Bryant brings exactly the right blend of experience, judgment, and compassion to this role,” said Inspector General Ann Urling. “Her understanding of child welfare from both frontline and oversight perspectives, combined with her commitment to independence and accountability, will strengthen the Foster  Care Ombudsman Division and enhance trust for the children, families, and caregivers it serves.”
The previous ombudsman, Elizabeth Hardy, resigned in September to become commissioner at the state’s Bureau for Behavioral Health.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has announced several foster care reform efforts since taking office, including an effort to bring 380 foster children in out-of-state institutions back to West Virginia. Foster children are in facilities in states including California, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to DoHS data. 
Morrisey also plans to expand a school-based program for at-risk children to reduce the number of children coming into foster care. He’ll use $8 million in unspent federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to pay for the project.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire legislators are one step closer to loosening regulations on the state’s meat industry.
House Bill 396, which would permit the in-state sale of certain meat products processed at non-U.S. Department of Agriculture facilities, including cuts of beef and pork, passed the House, 214-119, on Wednesday.
Such sales would go against federal law, which calls for meat sold commercially in the United States to be inspected and approved by the USDA, or by a state agency partnered with the department. In New Hampshire, which does not have a state inspection program, meat for commercial sale must be processed at a USDA-approved facility with a federal inspector present during the slaughter.
There are four such USDA facilities in the state, but proponents of the bill said wait times for slaughter appointments are long and difficult to secure for small farmers. This bill, they said, was an important step to help those farms compete in the state’s meat market.
“We need to be cognizant that our consumers and our farmers want this. They don’t have to do it, but they want it, and it gives more security to our state by giving more options,” said Rep. Barbara Comtois, a Barnstead Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor.
Critics raised concerns about food safety, associated with the lack of oversight during processing, and liability that participating farmers could incur by violating federal law.
Rep. Peter Bixby, a Dover Democrat, said he agreed the problem the bill attempted to solve was legitimate. But the bill is problematic because it conflicts with federal law, he said. 
At a hearing in November, Commissioner Shawn Jasper of the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food said the department would not take steps in violation of federal law. Bixby said this meant the state could not enforce the provisions of the bill, including some of its cold storage, labeling, and humane slaughter requirements. He also questioned whether farmers would take advantage of the program knowing they could incur liability or face legal consequences.
The bill still needs to win Senate approval before it reaches the governor’s desk.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/beef1-1024x694.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 14:58:59.245460

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY  – The head of a statewide Islamic advocacy group Wednesday questioned whether Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s decision to investigate a proposed mosque was a proper use of his office and taxpayer dollars.
Veronica Laizure, Council on American-Islamic Relations Oklahoma executive director, called the attorney general’s plans to use state resources to investigate a proposed mosque in Broken Arrow a “publicity stunt” and “witch hunt” by Drummond, who is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
Drummond on Wednesday issued a press release saying his office would investigate whether the proposed mosque and retail development in Broken Arrow complies with state and federal law and its funding.
“Given the realities of global terrorism, there can be no compromise on public safety and security,” Drummond said. “In our state, we have already seen a radical Islamist sentenced for plotting mass murder. Several 9/11 hijackers had attended an Oklahoma flight school. It is only appropriate to act with caution when the project in question might have connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
The Islamic Society of Tulsa is seeking permission from Broken Arrow city leaders to open a 42,000-square-foot community center. It would include a worship area, public medical clinic and retail space.
The mosque is to be built on 15 acres south of the Creek Turnpike along Olive Avenue. 
The  Broken Arrow Planning Commission approved a rezoning request. The Broken Arrow City Council is set to take up the issue next week. The land was purchased in 2014 by the North American Islamic Trust.
Drummond said the North American Islamic Trust “reportedly has ties to the radical Muslim Brotherhood.” The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, is an Islamic political movement. President Donald Trump last year created a process to designate certain chapters as foreign terrorist organizations.
Drummond did not provide proof of the Oklahoma group’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in his press release, but also said there are questions about the project’s ownership structure, governance and financing.
Drummond’s decision to invest the proposed mosque “mirrors a broader pattern of anti-Muslim initiatives we are seeing from public officials in multiple states,” Laizure said.
Laizure questioned whether Drummond had launched any similar investigations into other places of worship in Broken Arrow or elsewhere in the state.
“If not, that would seem like a pretty targeted attack on the Muslim community of Tulsa,” Laizure said.
She said there are many other concerns Drummond could address rather than the construction of an above-board and transparent house of worship for a minority  faith community.
The Council on American Islamic Relations is the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization.
Unrelated anti-Islamic remarks Drummond made in June drew pushback from a variety of sectors.
Drummond said Afghan evacuees that have resettled in Oklahoma should be sent back.
Tens of thousands of Afghan refugees were resettled in the United States after military forces pulled out of the country. Many of those relocated had assisted the U.S. military.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, one of four candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to be the next governor, is ringing the election year with a plan she says will ensure health care in the state is affordable, accessible and fair. 
“I’ve been traveling Michigan throughout the last year as a candidate to be the next Governor of Michigan and no exaggeration, every stop, from Iron River in the Upper Peninsula to here in Detroit, to Flint to Muskegon, every stop, Michiganders have shared heart wrenching stories about a broken, unfair, inaccessible and increasingly unaffordable health care system,” Benson told reporters during a Thursday.
Also seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki. While a report from the Detroit News said Gilchrist could end his campaign to run for secretary of state instead, the lieutenant governor’s campaign has not commented. 
With Benson and her campaign have touting her work in reshaping Michigan’s Department of State – taking Michigan from 31st in the nation to 2nd in election administration and implementing several voter-initiated reforms including same day voter registration and no-reason absentee voting – Benson pledged to similarly transform the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the state’s largest department. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“As Secretary of State, I transformed our state’s second largest agency to be service driven, saving residents time and money and making their lives easier,” Benson said. “Now I want to make all of state government work that well.” 
At present, the state health department is too complicated, outdated and disconnected from the people it serves, Benson said, later telling reporters that a revamp of the department would be a centerpiece of her health care agenda. 
With many changes from Congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act set to take effect during the next governor’s tenure, Benson said she would ensure the department works with residents to provide easy and seamless access to their medical coverage and other supports.
“That means also building an internal infrastructure that will use all the data that we already have as a state to ensure eligible Michiganders can keep their Medicaid or SNAP access without having to jump through additional hoops, fill out additional duplicative forms, and overall engage in an inefficient process,” Benson said.

Benson said her administration would also fund navigators and community health workers to reach out to individuals to help individuals stay enrolled in their benefits. 
“We’re going to be a helping hand, not an obstacle course,” Benson said. 
In addressing affordability, Benson also promised to establish a prescription drug affordability board within her first 100 days as governor. The board would have the authority to review drug manufacturing practices, approve price increases and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for price gouging. 
Creating a prescription drug affordability was a key priority for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the previous legislative session, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. However legislation to establish the board never made it out of the House Representatives after passing through the Michigan Senate. 
Benson said she would use every tool in her toolbox as governor to pursue her health care agenda, and that she would be looking at legislative action as well as executive action in order to accomplish priorities like establishing the prescription drug affordability board.
To address medical debt, Benson said she would empower the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to implement medical debt forgiveness programs, increase access to financial counseling and partner with hospitals to limit aggressive collection. 
Benson also said she would expand access by investing into more mobile health care units, which will provide low or no-cost medical services to residents of rural and underserved communities. 
Under Benson’s plan, the state would continue to invest in its health care workforce by expanding career technical education programs and scholarships for students pursuing medical careers, alongside creating tax and loan forgiveness programs.
She would also work to address the maternal health crisis within the state, particularly among Black Mothers who are more than twice as likely to die from causes related to pregnancy than non-Hispanic white women. 
According to her health care plan, Benson would direct state investments into culturally competent care, Medicaid-covered doula and midwife services, mandatory bias training for maternal healthcare providers and better access to life-saving prenatal and postpartum care to ensure all Michigan mothers can access the care they need. 
She also promised to take steps to make sure Michiganders have fair access to health care. 
“We need to ensure that medical decisions are based on transparent data and presented in ways that people can actually understand,” Benson said. “That means we’ve got to use technology to help people also appeal unfair health care coverage determinations made by insurance agencies.”
As governor, Benson would require hospitals to show patients their costs upfront and create an online portal where residents can report hospitals that do not comply, working with the Department of Attorney General to hold them accountable.
Her administration would also crack down on insurance companies who deny care to patients prescribed by doctors, by equipping the state health department to help patients file complaints when their insurers reject coverage for treatments. 
Benson also noted Michigan’s aging population as another area in need of action, with nearly 25% of the state’s population enrolled in Medicare, the nation’s insurance program for individuals 65 and older.
To help care for the state’s aging population, Benson pointed to another one of Whitmer’s priorities: the creation of a caregiver tax credit. 
In addition to expanding counseling services for seniors, Benson said she would work to pass a $5,000 tax credit for caregivers to help alleviate the financial burden of caring for an aging loved one.
“The bottom line for me is this: the next governor of Michigan must be prepared on day one to leverage every tool in the toolbox to ensure health care is affordable, accessible and fair in our state,” Benson said. “And I not only have a plan to do that, I have the experience necessary to transform state government to get this done.”

Mike Dunleavy have issued disaster declarations. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After enduring weeks of record-breaking cold and snowfall that buried Alaska’s capital city, taxing local infrastructure and services, residents of Juneau are now bracing for an abrupt change to rain that will bring new hazards.
The City and Borough of Juneau and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska issued a joint disaster declaration late Tuesday in advance of an incoming atmospheric river that is expected to create flooding, avalanche risks and possibly landslide risks. Gov. Mike Dunleavy followed that with a verbal disaster declaration that Juneau officials say will provide quicker access to state help to prepare for and respond to impacts of the coming atmospheric river.
Atmospheric rivers are elongated bands of heat and moisture that move north from more southern latitudes. They can dump vast amounts of rain and sometimes snow, and they have triggered deadly landslides in Southeast Alaska and other mountainous areas.
The coming atmospheric river is expected to bring more snow to Juneau at first, but that is expected to change to rain by early Friday, said Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
Ferrin and other officials spoke at a Juneau news conference held late Wednesday by local and tribal officials.
The expected rains will come on top of snow levels that have already strained building roofs, made roadways impassable and caused other disruptions. Officials warned they could trigger lower-elevation floods from clogged waterways and storm drains and various types of slides at higher elevations.
“This storm and the atmospheric river that’s headed our way on top of this historic, unprecedented amount of snowfall that we’ve had does come with an increased chance for landslides and avalanches,” Ryan O’Shaughnessy, emergency programs manager for the City and Borough of Juneau, said at the news conference.
The city may issue evacuation notices if they are needed in certain parts of town, he said.
Dunleavy’s verbal disaster declaration adds to a series of other recent state disaster declarations. On Monday, he issued a declaration for a December power outage in the Yukon-Kuskokwim village of Napaskiak. On Dec. 10, he issued a disaster declaration for a wind storm that caused widespread damage in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. And he and the federal government issued disaster declarations in October for the damages caused to Western Alaska by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.
The new state, local and tribal disaster declarations are currently only for the City and Borough of Juneau. However, almost all of Southeast Alaska is under a flood watch from early Friday to late Saturday, with additional high wind watches also applicable in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.
Ferrin said the deep snowpack in the mountains around Juneau will likely absorb whatever rain is dumped by the atmospheric river.
That is not the case in more southern parts of the Southeast Alaska panhandle, where there is little to no snow on the ground, she said.
Those areas face some different types of flood dangers, including the possibility of landslides, she said.
The atmospheric river heading to Alaska will bring a little bit of snow to the more southern parts of the panhandle, but that will change to rain more quickly than in Juneau, she said. Rainfall in those areas is expected to total 2 to 4 inches or possibly more, she said.
Combined with expected high winds and flooding, there are landslide risks in the southern part of Southeast Alaska that have been noted by the National Weather Service, Ferrin said.
“We will continue to monitor any potentials for other impacts throughout the event and coordinate with the emergency managers in the southern Panhandle for what needs or any impacts that they’re seeing on the ground in real time,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of Layne Griffith)Florida businesses that purposely ignore whether employees are legally in the United States could face hefty fines or even criminal charges if they hire more than 50 undocumented immigrants, according to a sweeping new immigration package.
Filed Wednesday by Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the 34-page bill would presume certain non-citizens are at fault in car accidents, severely restrict their employment, and prevent state banks from loaning them money.
It’s the most wide-ranging immigration bundle proposed so far ahead of the 2026 session, and would extend a 2025 crackdown that removed in-state tuition for undocumented students, imposed state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, and required all counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The nationwide push to quash all avenues for undocumented immigration has been exemplified in Florida, the first state to create a state-run migrant detention center. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, Sunshine State officials have mirrored his anti-illegal immigration agenda.
This includes deputizing hundreds of state and local officials to act as immigration officers; Florida is the only state to have all of its (67) counties entering into 287(g) agreements, which are partnerships with ICE.
Martin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
E-Verify penalties
SB 1380 would create civil penalties for employers who fail to properly use E-Verify, a federal database that checks whether new hires are legally authorized to work in the country. This builds off of another Martin bill, which would require all businesses to use E-Verify.
Employers who fail to check workers’ immigration status through E-Verify before submitting workers’ compensation claims would be personally liable for any costs, expenses, or benefits for undocumented employees.
Purposely not checking their status, however, would result in suspension of business licenses for one year and fines up to $10,000. Doing it again would result in a five-year license suspension alongside a $100,000 fine, and a third violation would mean permanent license revocation and a $250,000 fine.
If the employer purposely flouts this section and the undocumented worker then ends up injuring another person, the employer’s license would be suspended for five years with a $100,000 fine. If the worker kills another person, the licenses would be permanently revoked with a $500,000 fine.
In a similar vein, the bill would impose a third-degree felony charge for an employer who knowingly hires more than 50 undocumented workers. The business would permanently lose its license. The bill would create a cause of action against the employer for any person injured or the next of kin of a person killed by the actions of an undocumented worker.
These provisions evoke a recently closed, two-year federal investigation into Archer Western, a road-building company hired by the state that employed undocumented immigrants for years, as the Tampa Bay Times has reported.
Officials opened the investigation after an undocumented Archer Western employee driving heavy machinery in 2022 hit and killed a Pinellas County deputy. At least 18 of his coworkers on that state-funded construction site were also undocumented.
Car accidents, foreign remittances, and licensing
SB 1380 would create a rebuttable presumption of fault in car accidents involving undocumented immigrants from other states. This means if an out-of-state driver who is undocumented is involved in a car accident in Florida, authorities could presume he or she was at fault — as long as the other motorist wasn’t driving recklessly, under the influence, or clearly at fault.
Insurers could not pay benefits or settle claims with an unauthorized out-of-state driver, the bill says.
Additionally, the bill requires law enforcement officers investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.
Other provisions would ban the state Division of Risk Management from approving a claim submitted by an adult undocumented immigrant. Unauthorized immigrants would be barred from sending money to other countries and state banks could not accept IDs traditionally used by undocumented immigrants or those illegally in the state with down payments or loans.
All licensing procedures, relicensing instruction, and licensing testing must be conducted in English, the bill says. Interpreters, translators, or alternate language accommodations would be banned.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Kevin Nance)A new Kentucky law that stands to put many peer support specialists out of work should be declared “void and unenforceable,” says a lawsuit filed in Fayette Circuit Court that seeks an expedited hearing.
The law, which took effect Jan. 1, sets new licensing standards for peer support specialists to be employed in many drug and alcohol treatment settings. It triggered the apparently unintended cut-off of Medicaid payments to support the work of the vast majority of Kentucky’s peer support workforce who have yet to obtain the new credential.
Peer support is considered an essential ingredient in recovery. Peer support specialists, who earn $15-$18 an hour in Kentucky, share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with those new to recovery. Their duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills.
Mary Helen Shashy is executive director of Grin Grant Inc.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of peer support specialists Wes Hagenbuch and Adrianna Kenley and Grin Grant Inc., a Lexington-based nonprofit that employs and trains peer support workers.
The defendants are the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors; the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and its secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, and the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities.
The suit, filed Dec. 27 by attorney Frank Miller, alleges that no regulations for implementing the new law have been enacted by the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors, creating uncertainty and making it impossible to comply with the law’s new requirements.
Hagenbuch says in an affidavit that state government agencies have put out “inconsistent and shifting compliance expectations, enforcement standards, and timelines applicable to my work.”
As of Jan. 8, only 74 people had been licensed under the new law as registered alcohol and drug peer support specialists, compared with 16,883 who were certified under the previous standards.
The legislation, House Bill 505 enacted in 2024, includes a provision to allow Medicaid reimbursements to continue for peer support workers who obtain a temporary credential under the new standards, but the Beshear administration has said that Kentucky Medicaid rules, approved by the federal government, do not allow Medicaid reimbursement for services provided by someone with only a temporary credential.
The Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors has approved 755 temporary credentials for alcohol and drug peer support specialists.
Kentucky set to pull funding from peer support for recovery, is asked to reconsider

The lawsuit asks Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis for expedited consideration and to issue a restraining order and injunction. 
In response to the lawsuit, Kendra Steele, spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said via email, “Team Kentucky is committed to ensuring those suffering from addiction have access to the support services they need.  
“CHFS would support any changes the General Assembly would take to update HB 505 to allow more peer support specialists to provide services and expand what Medicaid can cover for those services.   
“However, as it is currently written, the law passed by the General Assembly required these changes to go into effect January 1st, impacting what Kentucky Medicaid can legally reimburse for peer support specialist services — which this lawsuit seems to ignore.”
The Lantern is awaiting a response from the Public Protection Cabinet, which oversees the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors.
Last month before the law took effect, peer support specialist Chris Sudduth of Georgetown told the Lantern his work hours had already been cut because employers “don’t know how to navigate the new laws.”
Sudduth, 43, a peer support specialist for three years, said, “I’m afraid I’m going to lose my apartment, everything I’ve worked for these three years. Even more I’m afraid I’m going to lose my sobriety over it.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Peer-support_DxO-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

(Getty Images)State health officials won’t change their recommendations for childhood vaccines, endorsing the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services announced Thursday.
The announcement comes three days after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday scaled back its list of recommended childhood vaccines — cutting its list of diseases for which childhood vaccines were recommended to 11 from 17.
The change has alarmed public health organizations and providers across the country.
“No new clinical data on either safety or effectiveness were presented that would justify these changes,” wrote Dr. Ryan Westergaard, the DHS chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for communicable disease, in a memo sent Thursday to providers and organizations that offer vaccination services in Wisconsin.
Ryan Westergaard, M.D., Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services
“The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) stands by our current clinical guidance regarding vaccines in Wisconsin, and will not be making any changes to Wisconsin’s school or child care recommendations,” Westergaard wrote.
“We have not seen any new scientific evidence that would justify changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, which is widely understood to have prevented millions of infections and continues to protect the health of children in the United States,” Westergaard said Thursday.
The department is following the childhood vaccine recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Wisconsin providers should continue to follow evidence-based vaccine recommendations from AAP and other professional medical organizations, and parents should talk to trusted health care providers about timely vaccination,” said Dr. Stephanie Schauer, the DHS immunization program manager. “This is our best way to prevent the spread of diseases that can cause life-long health impacts for children, families, and entire communities.”
The CDC’s decision followed a directive in December from President Donald Trump to look to other developed countries, including Denmark, in revising its vaccine schedule. Federal officials said the change was based on that review and called the U.S. a “global outlier” for the number of diseases and vaccine doses in its recommendations.  
“The CDC’s new recommendations were based on a brief review of other countries’ practices and not based on data or evidence regarding disease risks to children in the United States,” DHS Secretary-designee Kirsten Johnson said Thursday. “This upends our longstanding, evidence-based approach of protecting our children from the viruses that pose a risk in our country.”
She said the CDC change ignored other factors.
“Copying another country’s schedule without its health and social infrastructure will not produce the same health outcomes,” Johnson said. “It creates chaos and confusion and risks the health of Wisconsin’s youngest and most vulnerable citizens.”
DHS administers Wisconsin’s Medicaid programs and said the health insurance program for people with low incomes will cover all the recommended vaccines, including for newborns. They will also remain covered under the Vaccines for Children program.
The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance issued a reminder Thursday that state law requires individual, small group and self-funded health plans to cover immunizations for patients and their dependents from birth without a copayment.

To check on a child’s vaccine status and recommended vaccines see the  Wisconsin Immunization Registry.

Newsom will tout a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom will promote California as an antidote to the Trump agenda on Thursday, telling lawmakers during a wide-ranging State of the State address that California still leads in a host of critical areas such as manufacturing, technology and agriculture. 
“Every year, the declinists, the pundits and critics suffering from California derangement syndrome look at this state and try to tear down our progress,” he said in prepared remarks released ahead of delivery. “California’s success is not by chance — it’s by design.”
He will tout a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office. 
The address is his first State of the State before the Legislature since 2020. He will use it as an opportunity to highlight progress on some of his most ambitious promises, some of which haven’t been met, while positioning California and its leader as worthy of national leadership. 
He targeted the Trump administration on a range of issues, including excessive policing and immigration raids, saying the state “faces an assault on our values unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime.” And in a common talking point for Newsom recently, he criticized the president for deprioritizing clean energy as China surges forward in electric vehicle production.
“In California, we are not silent. We are not hunkering down. We are not retreating. We are a beacon. This state is providing a different narrative,” he said in the prepared remarks. 
On homelessness, the announced reduction in 2025 of unsheltered people, or the number of people who sleep outside, in cars or anywhere else not meant for habitation, is an important figure for the governor as he seeks to show improvement on one of California’s most stubborn challenges in his final year in office. 
A humanitarian and public health crisis and the most visible consequence of California’s housing shortage, homelessness is sure to be an issue on which Newsom faces national criticism should he make an expected presidential run in 2028. 
But the reduction came after years of increases in homelessness despite Newsom’s campaign promises to address the issue and his administration pouring over $24 billion into it during his two terms. In 2024, the year before the announced reduction, homelessness in California hit a record high: 123,974 were unsheltered while 63,110 were sheltered. That year, homelessness also spiked nationally.
Newsom on Thursday will not announce the number who were homeless overall in 2025. He will tout his administration’s focus on sweeping street encampments and building new mental health facilities paid for with Prop. 1, a bond he promoted and which voters approved in 2024.
He will also speak about making the state more affordable, an issue over which Democrats and Republicans nationally are jockeying for credit after the 2024 presidential election showed voters were heavily motivated by the high cost of living. 
He plans to seek out policies in his final year in office to crack down on large-scale investors buying up houses, forcing would-be homebuyers to compete — a day after Trump also announced a similar effort. It’s a new area for him in housing policy, after years seeking to boost construction. Newsom ran on a promise of building 3.5 million new housing units; the state has fallen far short of that. 
Newsom also ran on a promise of a universal public health care system; he has since shifted to expanding access to Medi-Cal, the state health program for low-income residents that faces punishing federal cuts under Trump. On Thursday, he will tout the state’s production of $11 insulin as one way his administration has tackled health care costs. 
Projecting a rosier budget outlook
The address was also a preview of Newsom’s last budget proposal, to be released Friday. 
Though the state began the year facing an estimated $18 billion deficit and remains threatened by federal cuts, Newsom said revenues have come in $42 billion higher than expected — a “windfall” officials mostly attribute to stock market gains and the artificial intelligence boom. 
That could allow him to avoid difficult fights with Democratic lawmakers over major cuts to programs in his final year in office, while maintaining funding for banner Newsom administration priorities like expanding public school to include all four-year-olds and providing more funding for community colleges. 
With a rosier-than-expected financial picture, Democrats will be sure to jockey for additional funding for their favored programs or to reverse scheduled cuts to Medi-Cal coverage for low-income undocumented immigrant adults they made last year. But Newsom will propose instead to put $7 billion into reserves and $11 billion toward pension obligations. 
And as Democrats debate a proposal to tax the wealthiest Californians to generate more revenue (an idea Newsom opposes), the governor instead will propose to renew a business development tax credit that has been often used by the technology and manufacturing sectors.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/011024_Newsom-Jan-Budget_MG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

Joe Sweeney speaks at a press conference to outline House Republican priorities for 2026 on Oct. 30, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House abruptly killed a Republican bill to impose budget caps on school districts Thursday, after some Republicans joined Democrats to dramatically alter the bill. 
The chamber also voted against reconsidering the bill, a parliamentary move that prevents the proposal from returning to the House floor this year, in a major setback for the Republican priority. 
After a chaotic series of votes, the chamber voted, 346-9, to strike down the bill, House Bill 675. But that vote came after Democrats teamed up with 22 Republicans to pass a floor amendment to override most of the original bill and limit the cap only to school district administrative expenses. 
That change, which passed, 182-173, proved to be a dealbreaker for the Republican supporters of the original bill. After the alteration, the bail failed an ought-to-pass nearly unanimously, and then was killed by voice vote. 
Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, accused Democrats of deploying a “poison pill,” in which lawmakers alter a bill solely to make it unpalatable to pass.
“So weird how all the Democrats who voted to replace the bill entirely with the poison pill amendment then voted against the bill — comprised entirely of their poison pill amendment they supported minutes before,” Sweeney wrote on the social media platform X.
The idea of a mandatory cap on public school spending increases has become a major pillar of New Hampshire Republicans’ response to high property taxes. The original HB 675 would have restricted the annual budgets of school districts to increase from the year before only by inflation. In order to override that universal budget cap and pass a budget with spending increases, residents in those school districts would need a two-thirds supermajority vote, the bill stipulated.
Republicans have framed the bill as a necessary correction to years of increasing school budgets and rising local property taxes. They’ve said the caps would force school boards to be more thoughtful with any proposed budget increases given the need to convince a supermajority of voters to approve them.
“The number one issue I hear from voters and residents and neighbors is that our property taxes are just getting out of control,” said Sweeney in a speech on the floor. “It’s pricing seniors out of their homes. It’s making it harder for young families to buy into the New Hampshire market.”
Sweeney said residents have not seen relief. “They just go into the school districts where they just continue to propose higher budgets, because they take the money that the state sends them, they lightly increase their tax rate as much as they can before people really start to revolt, and the spending keeps going up and up and up,” he said. “Something has to give.”
But Democrats have slammed the idea as anti-democratic and a threat to local control. They’ve noted that all recent school district budget increases were approved by majorities of voters at annual meetings, and that voters already have the ability to adopt tax caps in their individual school districts if they want. Instead, Democrats have called for the state to contribute more funding to local schools, arguing that could help reduce property tax burdens. 
“The real harm done by this bill will be felt in the overcrowded public school classrooms by … the 90% of Granite State kids who are there, where they have fewer educational opportunities despite their community’s desires,” said Rep. Mary Hakken-Phillips, a Hanover Democrat, speaking on the House floor. 
The House added a number of last-minute floor amendments to the bill Thursday.
But the final — and crucial — amendment changed the bill from a broad cap on new spending in future school district budgets to a state requirement that school boards devote no more than 6% of their budgets to administrators. That amendment was sponsored by three Republican representatives: Lorie Ball of Salem, Ralph Boehm of Litchfield, and Joseph Barton of Littleton. 
Speaking in favor of that amendment, Rep. Kristine Perez, a Londonderry Republican, noted that she and other residents in her conservative town had recently advocated for a local tax cap. But voters ultimately decided to direct the school board to study the issue first, and the resulting study convinced Perez that a tax cap is not an ideal way to restrain spending. 
“We all agree that property taxes are rising too fast and school budgets are the largest driver. The real question before us now is how do we apply restraint without harming classrooms or stripping away local control,” Perez said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0690-1024x560.jpg,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

Oneida tribal leaders in Wisconsin announced they would end a contract to build ICE facilities with a the Oneida Engineering Science Construction Group and apologized saying they were previously unaware of the agreement. | Getty ImagesOneida Engineering Science Construction Group (OESC), a Limited Liability Company (LLC) of the Oneida Nation, is taking action to terminate two contracts it has with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide engineering services to at least 34 ICE facilities.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The action comes after tribal leaders only recently became aware of the contracts that OESC has through a subsidiary company: Oneida Environmental (OE) that is working in a joint venture with Stantec JV, called Oneida-Stantec JV, LLC.
In a Jan. 2 Oneida Live online meeting, Tribal Chairman Tehassi Hill said he had just learned of the ICE contracts on Monday morning, Dec. 29 through social media posts.
“I want to make sure that I clearly state that the Oneida Business Committee (OBC, the agency that runs the tribe when the tribal governing board is not in session) was not aware of this joint venture or the signing of the contract,” said Hill. “I also stand strong in my words and conviction that the business venture does not align with the nation’s values, our culture and who we are as Haudenosaunee People, and it is something the committee would have never entertained had it been made aware of this.”
Jeff House, chief executive officer (CEO) of OESC, took full responsibility for the contracts, adding  that his motives were to provide a service to ensure the ICE facilities were habitable for residents and also as a business venture to sustain the operation of the LLC’s 500 employees.
“I deeply apologize,” House said. “The decision did come to me and I green-lighted the proposals to go forward, and I know it was a huge mistake.”
House said when he made the decision he wanted  to ensure the facilities would be “up to code, making sure they meet human standards, making sure that it’s properly engineered.” And, he added, “while I don’t approve and am appalled by the ICE activities, these people are being detained and put in a facility somewhere, and what had gone through my mind was, ‘Who’s taking care of them? Who’s looking out for their best interest?’ As much as I have disdain for the ICE activities going on, that’s where my mind went, and I was flabbergasted that I didn’t reach out further and get more information.”
House said he was aware of the recent controversy involving the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas to terminate a subsidiary contract with ICE for designing large-scale migrant detention centers, and he applauded the Potawatomi Chairman for noting how Indian people had been treated by the federal government by being placed on reservations and drew parallels to ICE activities.
House said he hadn’t considered the history of tribes and detention when he pursued the ICE contracts, but was more focused on ensuring the ICE facilities would be humane facilities.
According to the Federal Procurement Data System for Oneida-Stantec JV LLC, the recent ICE contract signed on Dec. 26 is for $3.777 million, and another contract signed on Sept. 19 is for $2.601 million.
House said the immediate goal is to begin the process of terminating the Dec. 26 contract, but he noted that the Sept. 19 contract, initiated under the administration of former President Joe Biden, would be more complicated to terminate because work had already begun under that contract.
House emphasized the LLC  would sustain any loss or liability as it pursued the terminations.
To avoid potential liability to the tribe, Chairman Hill noted that the tribe doesn’t directly operate OESC or participate in day-to-day operations to maintain a “corporate veil.”
In a press release, the tribe explained the “corporate veil” is “a legal concept that recognizes a company as a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders, and it protects shareholders from personal liability for the company’s debts and obligations (meaning the company itself is responsible for its own liabilities).”
However, the OBC does appoint members to the corporate board of OESC, and there are regular reports from the LLC to the OBC.
“It is important to reiterate that the Oneida Business Committee does not approve, negotiate or manage individual contracts of its subsidiaries,” said Hill, “and only provides high-level oversight.”
Hill read a recently passed OBC resolution that directs business decisions to reflect the Oneida Nation values and specifically states that “any employee or representative of Oneida Nation and its tribal corporations to disengage with all grant agreements and contracts that involve Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”
In the future, House said, he will keep the OBC informed of any gray areas of concern.
In 2025, House said, OESC processed $177 million in revenue and made $12 million in profit, most of which was reinvested in the LLC, with a small amount given to the tribe’s general fund. He estimated the valuation of the LLC as somewhere between $80-100 million.
House said one of his primary concerns in securing contracts, most of which are for engineering services, is keeping the LLC’s 500 employees on the job.

Free.,'We must respect and love one another': Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/we-must-respect-and-love-one-another-steny-hoyer-tells-us-house-hes-retiring,,"WASHINGTON — Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer announced Thursday he will retire from Congress at the end of this year, telling colleagues from both political parties in a floor speech he made the decision with “mixed emotion and reluctant conviction.” Hoyer, who was first elected in 1981 and later became majority leader, joins the dozens of members who have announced they will not seek reelection this November. Hoyer said there is still considerable work he wants to accomplish during the remainder of his term, while cautioning lawmakers against heightened partisanship. “I am deeply concerned that this House is not living up to the founder's goal,” Hoyer said. “I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to examine their conscience, renew their courage and carry out the responsibilities that the first article of the Constitution demands.”Hoyer, 86, expressed concern the U.S. reputation among allied nations has eroded, in part because lawmakers and political leaders have stepped back from core ideals. “I fear that America is heading not toward greatness but towards smallness, pettiness, divisiveness, loneliness and disdainfulness,” Hoyer said. “We must respect and love one another. We must remember that we are not great or unique because we say we are great, but because we are just, generous and fair.”Standing ovation, hugs, handshakesThe House chamber is normally empty at the start of the day, when lawmakers are able to give floor speeches on any topic they wish, before members move on to debate and pass legislation. That was not the case for Hoyer’s speech. About 75 lawmakers rose to give him a standing ovation before he began speaking and embraced him with hugs and handshakes after he formally announced his upcoming retirement. House Democratic leaders, Republican Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Republican Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic members of Maryland’s congressional delegation and former Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin all gathered to listen to Hoyer.A couple dozen members of Hoyer’s family, including his wife, children and grandchildren, watched from the gallery overlooking the House floor. Terp, lawyer, state senator, congressman, leaderHoyer graduated from the University of Maryland in 1963 before receiving his law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1966. He went into private practice but also ran and was elected to the Maryland state Senate in 1966. He was the chamber’s president from 1975 through 1979. Hoyer served as a member of the Maryland state board for higher education from 1978 through 1981. He was elected to the 97th Congress by special election in 1981 and represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, which covers part or all of several counties in the southern region of the state, including Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Prince George's and St. Mary's.Hoyer took on several leadership roles throughout the 45 years he’s been in the chamber. He was chairman of the House Democratic Caucus before becoming the party’s whip and ultimately the majority leader. He stepped back from leadership three years ago at the same time Pelosi stepped aside. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York succeeded Pelosi as the top Democrat in the chamber, while Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark became the whip, following Hoyer as the second-highest-ranking Democrat. The two watched as Hoyer reflected on his career during the nine-minute speech, telling those gathered in the chamber they are “extraordinary, decent people” who are only members of Congress because people from their communities thought they were up to the job. “The only way you got here was your neighbors said they wanted you to represent them,” Hoyer said. “With tremendous gratitude, I yield back.”",,,,2026-01-08 13:12:30.300069

When asked for a copy of the settlement, the community college directed the Iowa Capital Dispatch to submit a public records request, which was completed and no response was received by the time of publication. Drake University did not respond to requests for the agreement or comment.
Drake filed suit in federal court against DMACC in July 2024 after the community college launched a rebranding effort, claiming federal trademark infringement, unfair competition, injury to business reputation and unjust enrichment. DMACC was temporarily blocked from using the new designs. The community college filed a counterclaim for defamation, which was rejected.
According to the releases, DMACC tops the list of where students transfer from to attend Drake and the private college is “among the top five schools to which DMACC graduates transfer.” Both institutions belong to the Iowa Private Transfer Collaborative and participate in “cross-enrollment advising” to allow DMACC students guaranteed enrollment to Drake.
“Both parties look forward to continuing their long-standing partnership and shared programs in service to current and future generations of students,” both of the press releases stated.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deployed tear gas at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis Wednesday afternoon as students were being dismissed, hours after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman a few miles away, according to the teachers’ union.
The incident occurred hours after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis, sparking protests and a vigil that attracted thousands. 
Roosevelt High School is home to the Spanish immersion program for Minneapolis Public Schools. The student population is around one-third African American and one-third Hispanic American, according to the district.

Henifin also questioned the Mississippi Department of Health's recent results regarding the quality of the city's water. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)","After another hours-long hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said he would “deal with” his decision of whether to allow a water rate increase to move forward on Monday. The judge will have a phone call with the parties to hear their closing arguments, he said.
JXN Water manager Ted Henifin and his team of attorneys were visibly frustrated as the judge once again delayed the decision. The utility first introduced the idea of a 12% rate increase, which it says is necessary to keep Jackson’s water and sewer systems running, last February, nearly a year ago. JXN Water’s revenue for daily operations last year was about $30 million short of its need, the utility said. 
Wednesday’s hearing, the latest in a series of court sessions Wingate has held over the last few months to discuss the proposed increase, mostly saw attorneys question an expert the city of Jackson hired to review the utility’s financial records.
Michael Thomas, a former chief financial officer for both Jackson Public Schools as well as Jackson State University, testified that, if JXN Water improved its collections, it would see revenue growth “comparable” to what a rate increase would provide.
Numbers displayed in court showed the utility had greatly improved revenue collections since taking over the billing systems in October 2023. In that time, monthly revenue from water bills has nearly doubled, increasing from $4 million to about $8 million. Over the past year, the utility has stepped up collection efforts, shutting off water to thousands of accounts that were behind on payments.

Yet still, the rate of customers paying their bills stayed between 60% and 69% in recent months, records show. The improved revenue likely represents the utility collecting more payments from previously owed bills, Thomas said. 
Paul Calamita, an attorney for JXN Water, explained that collection efforts can take a while because the utility needs to ensure it can quickly turn a connection back on before shutting it off. That means the utility can only focus collections on certain neighborhoods at a time so that workers are physically present to restore connections, he said. 
Drew Martin, the Jackson city attorney, said it’s unfair for 60% of customers to bear 100% of the financial burden of the water and sewer systems. It’s also unfair for the utility to spend more than it can reasonably expect to recover from ratepayers, he argued. For example, JXN Water had already obligated over $7.5 million in monthly contacting expenses in October 2023, back when it only collected about $4 million a month from customers’ bills.

Calamita pushed back, arguing JXN Water is operating as efficiently and affordably as possible. He also disputed Martin’s point about contracting expenses, saying the utility had funds from the federal government it could use to supplement its revenue. Thomas, though, argued a company shouldn’t spend more than its “foreseeable” revenue. Last spring, the utility ran out of the $150 million of federal funds meant for daily operations, although it will soon see another $54 million originally intended for large projects. 
At the end of Wednesday’s proceedings, Jackson Mayor John Horhn said he mainly disagreed with a rate increase as the “only” solution. Horhn reiterated other avenues for relief, such as working with the state Legislature, “belt-tightening” around the utility’s expenses, and improving collections. He also said JXN Water needs a hardship process for those struggling to afford their bills. 
After the session, utility spokesperson Aisha Carson said the funding shortfalls are mostly impacting sewer service. Specifically, JXN Water is still delaying repairs to two large overflows in the city, one on Mill Street and another along I-55.  
City Council sends Wingate list of requests
The Jackson City Council on Tuesday approved a resolution sending a list of requests to Wingate. Council members Tina Clay, Kevin Parkinson and Lashia Brown-Thomas were in attendance at Wednesday’s hearing.
The requests included:

To extend Wingate’s order allowing amnesty from late penalties for customers who tell JXN Water they’re not being billed from Dec. 31, 2025, to April 30.
To order JXN Water to have in-person customer service available during business hours, from Monday to Saturday, without requiring an appointment.
To direct the utility and city to designate personnel to address billing challenges.
To require an affordability study around water rates.
To order JXN Water to send all sanitation revenue to the city and to do so on a quarterly basis moving forward. (The utuility has been withholding sanitation fees residents already paid on their water bills because the city owes about $6.4 million in upaid water bills, mostly stemming from leaks at the Jackson Zoo.)
To order JXN Water to offer a credit to the city in exchange for making bond payments JXN Water was responsible for. 
To prohibit Henifin from publicly commenting on the city’s attempts to secure alternative funding, “as such comments undermine public trust.”
To require equitable billing for customers in Byram and others outside the city limits.
To review “comparative contracting options” and “increase transparency regarding operational costs.”

Thomas, the city’s financial adviser, in his testimony said more customers would feel comfortable paying if they could more easily discuss their bill with someone in person.
Wingate said he would give JXN Water until Jan. 20 to respond to the council’s requests.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06074532/AP24012739993750-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:59:07.823532

Jeremy Dean, a Springfield Democrat, speaks in February in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri House should order a Democratic lawmaker who sent a “vulgar and sexual” message to a colleague during the September special session to stay at least 50 feet away from her, the Ethics Committee recommended Wednesday.
The committee, with a unanimous vote of its five Republican and five Democratic members during an Oct. 29 hearing, also recommended that state Rep. Jeremy Dean, a Democrat from Springfield, lose his committee seats, undergo sexual harassment prevention training and have his seat on the House floor and his parking spot moved.
The committee’s report and recommendations were made public for the first time after they were published Wednesday in the journal for the opening day of this year’s session. 
Ethics Committee Chairman Lane Roberts, a Republican from Joplin, said the recommended punishment is in line with punishments recommended during past actions of the committee. The ethics committee can recommend a range of punishments, including censure and expulsion from the House.
“Our goal here is to make sure that what we do is balanced, and part of that balance is looking back through our history, how we handled such things in the past,” Roberts said.
Dean was given 15 days to object to the sanctions and did not.
In an interview with The Independent, Dean said he did not object because he accepts that the texts were inappropriate. But he added that he thinks the ethics complaint was motivated by politics.
“It seems more to me that the Republicans saw this as an opportunity to bash a Democrat in the news while they knew that they were continuing to get bad press and losing elections across the country,” Dean said. “And so this is an opportunity for them to continue to try and hold on to the state of Missouri when they know things are going downhill for them.”
On Sept. 4, while Dean was engaged in a sit-in on the House floor, he sent a text message to state Reps. Cecelie Wiliams, a Republican from Dittmer, while she was participating in a hearing of the House Elections Committee.
Lawmakers were in special session in response to a call from President Donald Trump to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional districts to make it likely a Republican could win the 5th District seat held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat.
At the time of the text, the Elections Committee was taking testimony on a proposal to change how majorities are counted for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
In the text, Dean included a description of an oral sex act with the president and questioned how Republicans could talk while engaged in it. The text message became public when a screenshot of it was shared on social media by former Republican state Rep. Adam Schwadron.
Dean was watching the committee meeting on an online livestream and sent another text after seeing Williams’ reaction, the report states. The report does not describe the content of the second message.
Williams “was shocked by these messages, which were unprofessional and disruptive to the legislative process,” the report states.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, removed Dean from his committee assignments and has not placed him on any committees for this year’s session.
Both Dean and Williams testified during the Oct. 29 hearing and Dean admitted sending the text, the report states.
Dean “stated that he recognized that the messages were inappropriate and unprofessional, and that he regretted sending them,” the report states. Dean “denied any intent to disrupt the legislative process, intimidate (Williams), or improperly influence her participation in the committee hearing.”
The Ethics Committee is the only House committee with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and a minority member vice chairman. The 10 members all approved the sanctions.
The committee’s unanimous vote shows members thought “the conduct was significantly egregious and that we needed to address it,” Roberts said. “Very serious consequences needed to be commensurate with the conduct, but again, it needed to be balanced with what we’ve historically done, so that we’re not guilty of treating one person differently than another.”
In the interview with The Independent, Dean said he sent the text to Williams because he thought he could joke with her. The are both serving their first terms in the House.
“Since the freshman bus tour, Rep. Williams and I had what I would consider a very good working friendship, and I obviously crossed the line with that text message,” he said. “I totally accept that.”
The biggest lesson learned is “that you’ve got to watch your back,” Dean said. “There are people in this city that you think are your friends, people that you can joke around with, but at the end of the day, a lot of people are here for their own political gain.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jeremy-Dean-021125-scaled-e1758025686404-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 12:59:07.823532

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers voted 43-0 Thursday to suspend legislative rules to speed up the process of possibly expelling a fellow senator.
Lawmakers suspended a rule requiring seven days of notice before a hearing is scheduled. This allows the Legislature’s Executive Board to hold a hearing on Legislative Resolution 282 on Jan. 12 after the board introduced the measure Wednesday.
The Executive Board, a group of legislative leaders that serve as the human resources arm of Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan Legislature, filed the resolution pursuing the expulsion of State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
The board unanimously recommended expelling McKeon following allegations he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. The board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said Thursday that the rule requiring seven days of notice serves an important function in informing the public of matters they might want to weigh in. However, he argued that LR 282 was not a policy matter, but a personnel issue.
Hansen said McKeon was given seven days notice of the Jan. 12 hearing in a letter Hansen sent him Jan. 5, outlining the process he planned to follow once the legislative session began. Only invited testimony will be allowed at the hearing, Hansen said, including from McKeon or his lawyer, and outside counsel Tara Paulson, who conducted the Legislature’s internal investigation.
Motion filed to expel McKeon from Nebraska Legislature

The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation separate from a Nebraska State Patrol criminal investigation that led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency in September.
The criminal allegation against him has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon pleaded not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest and changing his mind.
The incident took place at an end-of-session party last spring, according to the Legislature’s internal investigation conducted by Paulson, an attorney serving as outside counsel. The staffer claimed McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to Paulson’s report.
McKeon disputes this version of events and has previously claimed the incident was “exaggerated and mischaracterized.” In a written response to the Exec Board, McKeon argued that the board’s assertions include “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.”
There was little debate Thursday on Hansen’s motion to suspend the rules. All present senators voted yes on the motion, save for State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Bennington and McKeon, who were present-not-voting.
DeBoer said she abstained from voting out of principle, as she is generally cautious about suspending any legislative rule. However, she said she understood why Hansen was pursuing the motion.
“It is a very close one for me,” DeBoer said.



How the expulsion process works
To expel a member of the Nebraska Legislature, first a senator must introduce a legislative resolution presenting the motion. That resolution is then referred to a committee for a public hearing.
Per the Legislature’s rules, there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing (In McKeon’s case, the Legislature is considering suspending this rule). It’s up to the committee to determine whether the public hearing will include only invited testimony, or open it up to public comment.
Following the hearing, the committee must vote to advance the resolution to floor debate. If the resolution advances, it can be scheduled for floor debate the next day.
An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator. If successful, the motion would take effect immediately and the legislative seat would become vacant until the governor appoints a replacement.

(Cassie Stricker for The Texas Tribune)Faculty at Texas A&M University were told this week that roughly 200 courses in the College of Arts and Sciences could be affected by a new system policy restricting classroom discussions of race and gender, the implementation of which has already led administrators to direct a philosophy professor to remove Plato readings from a core course.
The changes are being made days before the semester begins and after some students have registered to attend.
The Texas Tribune obtained emails sent by college administrators showing the policy has already led to courses being cancelled or renumbered to remove them from core curriculum credit, with professors directed to alter course content or teach different classes.
The A&M System Board of Regents approved a policy in November requiring campus presidents to sign off on courses that could be seen as advocating “race and gender ideology” or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity. The move followed a student’s secret recording of a professor discussing gender identity in a children’s literature class that went viral on social media, sparking conservative backlash.
Regents revised the policy in December, barring most discussion of those topics in introductory or core curriculum courses unless administrators determine the material serves a “necessary educational purpose” and approve it in writing. This set off a rapid review of courses ahead of the spring semester’s Jan. 12 start.
Emails sent by college administrators Tuesday show that an introductory sociology course on race and ethnicity was canceled, a communications course on religion and the arts was renumbered and stripped of core curriculum credit, and a philosophy professor was told to remove Plato readings and other material related to race and gender from a core course or be reassigned.
In an email to students who had enrolled in SOCI 217, Introduction to Race and Ethnicity, administrators said they “carefully considered” whether the course could comply with the revised policy and “concluded that we cannot teach this course in its present form.” The message acknowledged that students enrolled in the class for a variety of reasons and said those with a “demonstrable need” to complete the course for a degree or career goals could pursue it instead through an independent study course.
Introduction to Race and Ethnicity had drawn scrutiny in the past. Texas Scorecard, a conservative website that is widely read by elected Texas Republicans and A&M regents, published stories in September and October criticizing the course and its assigned readings and identifying the professor who taught it.
In another case, Professor Martin Peterson submitted his syllabus for PHIL 111, Contemporary Moral Issues, for review Dec. 22. On Tuesday, his department head told him he had two options: remove the modules on race ideology and gender ideology, including readings from Plato, or be reassigned to teach a noncore philosophy course. The email, obtained by the Tribune, gave Peterson until the close of business Wednesday to decide.
Peterson responded that he would revise the syllabus, saying he plans to replace the Plato readings with lectures on free speech and academic freedom.
In a statement to the Tribune, A&M said the decision did not amount to a ban on teaching Plato and that other sections of the same course that include Plato – but do not include modules on race and gender ideology – had been approved.
The course changes described in those emails followed a broader review process that College of Arts and Sciences Interim Dean Simon North discussed Monday during a regularly scheduled meeting with a group of about a half-dozen faculty members.
Three faculty members in attendance told the Tribune that when asked, North said the college had identified roughly 200 courses as potentially affected by policy restrictions.
Andrew Klein, another faculty member who attended the meeting but could not recall the specific number of affected courses, said he understood the number to be preliminary because departments across the college were working under different deadlines to submit syllabi for review.
Faculty were told some departments were in the process of renumbering courses to take them out of the core curriculum, even classes that already had students enrolled for this semester. Others would need to remove readings or discussion topics, according to Sally Robinson, a professor who attended the meeting.
Faculty can ask for an exemption if they demonstrate that topics of race and gender are core to the curricula. Robinson said North told faculty members he estimated the college would request about 30 courses to be exempt from the policy, which the university will need to accept or deny in the coming weeks.
“Everyone is worried about students and about what’s going to happen next week,” said Robinson, who is asking for an exemption for two of her courses. “It’s unclear to us, and I think it’s unclear to the college as well, how those decisions are going to get made and who actually is going to make them.”
The Tribune left a voicemail for North and emailed detailed questions but did not receive a response. Two associate deans who were also contacted did not respond.
Peterson told the Tribune that the directive he received undermines the purpose of a university as a place for open inquiry and debate.
“Plato founded the Academy, the very first university,” Peterson said. “If we cannot freely discuss Plato, we no longer have a university.”
The Texas A&M Chapter of the American Association of University Professors and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression also criticized the move.
“This is what happens when the board of regents gives university bureaucrats veto power over academic content,” said Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. “The board didn’t just invite censorship, they unleashed it with immediate and predictable consequences.”
The College of Arts and Sciences is one of 17 colleges and schools at Texas A&M University in College Station, the flagship campus that includes 11 other universities subject to the same policy.
Other public university systems are taking similar steps. The Texas Tech University System now prohibits certain race- or sex-related course content except if it is required for licensing, certification or patient care, and Texas State University administrators have urged professors to revise course descriptions and titles they consider ideological.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The FBI ousted the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation into the killing of a 37-year-old woman by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, the head of the BCA said Thursday.
The BCA is the investigative arm of the state Department of Public Safety and typically investigates officer shootings.
The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment.
BCA Superintendent Drew Evans, in a statement Thursday, said the agency consulted with the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI, and the BCA’s Force Investigations Unit began conducting a joint investigation with the FBI.
But on Wednesday afternoon, the FBI told the BCA that the U.S. Attorney’s Office had “reversed course,” according to the BCA statement. That means the BCA will no longer have access to the case materials or the ability to conduct interviews to complete a thorough investigation.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Expelling the BCA is the latest maneuver in an ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the state of Minnesota and has already drawn sharp criticism from local officials.
“This move from the federal government to remove our state BCA from the investigation of yesterday’s homicide in South Minneapolis is deeply concerning,” said Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, on X. “This investigation needs to be carried out with transparency, fairness, and without political influence.”

(Photo courtesy of Rose Rohrer UNM BBER)As state environment agencies remediate legacy pollution from uranium mines, one New Mexico lawmaker is seeking $50 million more to clean up a variety of abandoned sites on state land that could contaminate the state’s land, water and air.
Those sites include decades-old defunct dry cleaners, oil and gas operations and the abandoned uranium mines.
Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) prefiled a bill, which, if passed in the upcoming 30-day legislative session, would give state agencies additional one-time funding to address such sites.
Lax regulations and impermanent companies in decades past often mean state officials cannot determine the party responsible for cleanup leaving New Mexicans “holding the bag,” Steinborn told Source NM during a phone interview this week.
Steinborn called uranium mines and other polluted areas “ticking time bombs” for the state’s water and soil. In a presentation last year, the  New Mexico Environment Department found people living around abandoned uranium mines could be exposed to the equivalent of more than a decade of radiation exposure in just one year.
“People are being exposed to environmental threats that they shouldn’t have to live with, and it has been this way for decades,” Steinborn said. “Leadership is sorely needed to clean up these areas and make them safe for people, but also to bring environmental justice to local and Indigenous communities.”
Direct state intervention to reckon with the legacy of abandoned uranium mines is in the nascent stages.
Previously, the federal government was charged with cleaning up all sites related to the decades of uranium mining. In 2022, the Legislature passed the 2022 Uranium Mine Cleanup Act, which gave state agencies the power to plan for and address environmental risks.
In the 2025 session, the Legislature approved $20 million for cleaning up pollution. Environmental agencies allotted $12 million to clean up four uranium mine sites, $6 million for cleaning up two areas contaminated with petroleum and $2 million to hire attorneys to track down past owners.
Last month, the New Mexico Environment Department announced the start of cleanup operations at four McKinley County mines. The four mines stand among an estimated 1,100 scattered along New Mexico’s western edge, many on or near the Navajo Nation or Zuni, Acoma and Laguna Pueblos, the result of decades of unregulated uranium mining driven by the federal government’s demands for nuclear weapons and power.
Anti-nuclear advocates expressed optimism about the prospect of additional funding.
“It’s really a very positive move for the state to be providing some leadership at this point and hopefully for the legislature to continue to fund this effort in the future,” Susan Gordon, the retired coordinator of the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment, told Source NM.
Leona Morgan, a longtime Diné anti-nuclear activist, told Source New Mexico in a phone call that cleanup is “better late than never,” but emphasized that the state should approach cleanup in a culturally-sensitive manner and establish permanent monitoring.
“The necessary work of cleaning up uranium contamination is going to be a long-term, maybe permanent process,” Morgan said. “So spending $50 million, $20 million is really not much, but I see it as a path forward, to what we really need: dedicated funding in perpetuity.”
State financial analysts conservatively project that addressing legacy uranium mines will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. A 2020 University of New Mexico study estimated the price tag could be “infinite,” due to the extent of possible contamination.
Additional funds would unlock further cleanups, NMED Uranium Mine Reclamation Coordinator Miori Harms told Source NM, noting that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency “technically has the jurisdiction, but they tend to prioritize their sites and these are the smaller ones that fall out the bottom. But they certainly present physical safety hazards and environmental hazards that we don’t want in our state.”
Steinborn said it was “incumbent” on the federal government to pitch in further.
“It’s great that we’re appropriating money to clean up some sites and help people out. But it’s a much bigger cost than what our state can afford,” he said.

The measure (SB 1160) is sponsored in the Senate by Ana Maria Rodriguez, who represents Monroe and a part of Miami-Dade County, and in the House (HB 889) by Susan Valdés, R-Tampa. The idea has been pushed for several years by criminal justice reform advocates. The bill says the legislation is necessary “to create an independent entity as a unit of the legislative branch of state government in order to restore public trust in the department.”
The bills come a month after an investigation into a Panhandle state prison by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that overcrowding and overstaffing resulted in a high concentration of complaints by inmates about excessive force and staff misconduct.
And they come more than five years after the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Florida issued a report regarding Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution, the state’s largest and oldest women’s prison. The report found reasonable cause to believe that Lowell failed to protect prisoners from sexual abuse by staff.
Nine states have created corrections ombudsman positions since 2018, while another two have created quasi-oversight bodies, according to Michele Deitch, director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas, which runs the National Resource Center for Correctional Oversight.
“It’s greater recognition of deaths in custody, of the violence going on inside, of poor conditions,” Deitch said.
“A lot of those are coming to light through journalistic accounts and through advocates’ reports and from people who have been incarcerated, but it’s also the fact that legislators are recognizing that what we’re doing now isn’t working. There are high recidivism rates, and we’re spending a lot of money on prisons and not knowing if they’re getting anything of real value from it, given the high recidivism rates and the poor conditions.”
The Federal Prison Oversight Act in 2024 established an independent ombudsman office to investigate complaints from incarcerated people, their families, and prison staff.
The office would:

Receive, track, investigate, and attempt to resolve complaints concerning correctional facilities made by or on behalf of incarcerated persons, supporters of incarcerated persons, and the public.
Monitor and evaluate conditions of confinement and treatment of incarcerated persons in correctional facilities.
Collect and analyze data relating to serious incidents, violence, and deaths in correctional facilities.
Recommend solutions to systemic problems as well as policy changes and corrective actions necessary to “protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of incarcerated persons.”
Provide information to incarcerated individuals, supporters of the incarcerated, and the public about the rights of those individuals.

The Legislature would create a Corrections Oversight Committee of 15 voting members to meet quarterly to advise the ombudsman. They would include four members of the Legislature and 11 members of the public representing various constituencies, including a man and woman who have previously served a prison sentence of at least three within the 10 years preceding their appointment.
The Legislature would appoint an ombudsman to a 5-year term, and he or she could be reappointed for an additional five years. The Legislature would be required to allocate $250,000 to fund the office.
Accompany legislation (HB 891/SB 1162) would create a public records exemption for correspondence and communications with the Office of the Corrections Ombudsman and the Corrections Oversight Committee.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/877e557ce702-tower.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:12:56.156231

Editor’s note: Below is an excerpt, permission of the Beacon Press, from “When It’s Darkness on the Delta: How America’s Richest Soil Became Its Poorest Land” by Mississippi author W. Ralph Eubanks, copyright 2026. The book will be released Tuesday. At 5:30 p.m. on that day, Square Books in Oxford  will host a conversation for the public by Eubanks and another Mississippi writer, Wright Thompson, about the book and the Delta. Mississippi Today Ideas also recorded a separate conversation between the two Mississippi writers you can watch at the link above.

In places of great poverty, hunger is a disease. When Jack Geiger and John Hatch began their work at the Delta Health Clinic, it didn’t take them long to recognize the depths of the Mississippi Delta’s malnutrition crisis. Hunger seemed to manifest itself like a fast-spreading virus. Public health nurses who made home visits often observed that people had little more than grits and beans to eat. One wrote that many children “live on a diet of cornbread, grits, and Kool-Aid” and that “the effects of malnutrition are staggering.” The inadequate diet of Delta residents materialized on the skin of children who were suffering from rashes, boils, dryness, and a protein deficiency that caused many of their bodies to consume their own protein tissue.
To combat rampant hunger, the two men decided to do something radical: they began to write prescriptions for food. These prescriptions for food – meat, eggs, vegetables, and milk – could be filled by a network of grocery stores in the Black community of Bolivar County, where the clinic was located, and the bill was sent to what was then called the Tufts-Delta Health Center for reimbursement. It was something Geiger learned from his time in South Africa, where dried skim milk was provided to starving children. In the South African townships where Geiger once worked, powdered milk came to be classified as medicine since – like a strong antibiotic used to fight an infection – it saved children’s lives.
Geiger and Hatch’s approach did not sit well with officials at the Office of Economic Opportunity, the agency that helped fund the clinic. They saw a doctor’s prescription only as a note authorizing the dispensing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of an actual disease, not as a directive to put food in the mouths of poor people. But Geiger didn’t budge. “If mothers and babies don’t eat, all the medicine in the world won’t work,” Geiger responded. What Geiger realized was that people in the Delta were hungry both out of extreme poverty and failed government policies regarding food. In the Mississippi Delta’s past and in its present, hunger is still a disease.
As Robert Kennedy’s 1967 trip to the Delta revealed, as farming in the region became mechanized, people were left without work and were hungry – some of them displaced from the plantations where they once worked, but all without any real economic future. Ignoring this change in economic conditions was a failure of public policy. Yet the bigger lesson of what Kennedy witnessed is not just what happened to the people of the Delta when farm mechanization took over. As historian Greta de Jong has written, “The black plantation workers who were pushed off the land by the modernization of southern agriculture were not to join the industrial working class in the post-civil rights era. Instead, they were the first to experience the transition from free labor to displaced persons that awaited millions of other workers in this new era of economic restructuring.” Kennedy may have been focused on the Delta, but he was also thinking about similar situations in other parts of the country. He witnessed how the economic restructuring of the Delta and the hunger that came with it would spread to other regions where economic shifts were also occurring, whether it was in the coal mines of Appalachia, or later in the industrial belt of the Midwest, or even in New York City’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a place that as US senator from New York he had personally observed as experiencing similar patterns of poverty.
Robert Kennedy believed in government action to confront mass unemployment, poverty and hunger, but that political ideology died with him when he was assassinated during his run for president in 1968. What replaced Kennedy’s idea of government intervention was belief in unfettered free enterprise. In the end, a blind belief in the power of market forces replaced Jim Crow laws as a way for whites to maintain economic power. Politicians like Ronald Reagan linked government social programs with economic decline rather than social justice. Government action to combat hunger and poverty came to be thought of as wasteful, and anti-poverty policies as creating an indolent class of people who would not work. Yet in the Delta and places like it, the reality was that there was little work and the work that existed could not sustain a family. The idea that people in places like the Delta were not hungry and just lazy is rooted in a myth of American individualism that only perpetuates poverty and hunger. Consequently, a new Jim Crow was born, but one that was visible only to those affected by it.

Over time, as the country moved from agricultural and industrial capitalism to financial capitalism in the late twentieth century and into the twenty first, the push toward market forces expanded from places like the Delta and spurred massive layoffs in other rural communities as well as places like the midwestern Rust Belt. Understanding what happened in the Delta helps us understand other economic developments in the post-civil rights era: the region’s economic circumstances may be particularly entwined with its long history of racial oppression, but what followed across the country links the circumstances there with structural economic changes on a national level. This happened without regard to the race of the people affected. As Delta civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer told novelist Paule Marshall in 1970, “hunger has no color line.” Hamer worked tirelessly to develop her Freedom Farm Cooperative to feed poor people in the Delta through grassroots participation. “All the qualifications that you have to have to become part of the co-op is to be poor,” Hamer proclaimed. Hamer knew the emphasis on market forces and the movement away from government intervention also knew no color line with respect to the people on whom it had an impact.
Although much has changed in the Mississippi Delta since Kennedy’s visit and the Delta Health Center’s prescriptions for food, food insecurity continues to be an issue, and food is still a political weapon. The people of the Delta may have more political power, but that power is diminished since they cannot use it to put food on their tables. Political power is concentrated at the local level, not the state or national level. Food and agricultural policies are set at the national level, and much of that power is in the hands of those who use the Delta’s rich farmland for the industrial farming of corn, cotton, and soybeans. Those with power have little interest or incentive to grow food to feed the region’s residents. The children and grandchildren of many of the families Kennedy visited continue to struggle to get food on the table – and the food that they can get is largely processed and high in fat.
In the years since the beginning of farm automation in the mid-1960s, the communities of the Mississippi Delta have experienced health inequities intertwined with discrimination, poverty and racial exclusion. In three Mississippi Delta counties that Kennedy visited = Bolivar, Washington, and Sunflower, whose aggregate population is roughly a hundred thousand = over 65 percent of residents identify as Black or African American and about 30 percent live at or below the poverty level, more than 50 percent of women and 40 percent of men living in these counties have obesity, and the rate of diabetes is 13.5 percent. All eighteen of the counties that comprise the Mississippi Delta are characterized by high levels of poverty, high prevalence of chronic disease, and mortality rates that significantly exceed the national average. In addition, mortality rates in the Delta have increased over the past 40 years while the national rate has decreased. In 2017 the death rate in the Delta from heart disease was the highest in the country, and it remains one of the highest today.
President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty promised to end hunger in America by making issues related to poverty and hunger the “urgent business of all men and women of every race and every religion and every region.” But in the Mississippi Delta, with its legacy of a plantation economy rooted in white supremacy, the eradication of hunger threatened the region’s politics. What the Delta reveals is not the failure of Johnson’s War on Poverty, but the ways farm policy – particularly farm subsidies – undermined those War on Poverty policies that could have had a long-term impact on the health of Delta residents and all poor Americans.
Where the War on Poverty did fail was in its architects’ and planners’ inability to predict changes in the economy that lowered employment and distributed economic growth unevenly. If economic growth had continued from the 1970s on, poverty rates would be much lower today. Consequently, there would have been fewer hungry people in the Delta. The failure narrative that blamed poverty on the poor in Mississippi – and across the United States – only reflects the success of politicians at rewriting history. Had more programs been allowed to begin and flourish in the Delta, the War on Poverty might have rattled some of the structures that created the region’s poverty and kept its citizens poor and hungry. Resistance was in the air, and that was exactly why Mississippi did not want the programs in place. White Mississippians did not want to disrupt the status quo. Once again, the Delta was left behind, along with poor people across America. And the mythology that some of the neediest people in the nation were lazy and just needed to get to work began to take shape and flourish. Ronald Reagan famously noted that America “fought a war on poverty and poverty won.” But a close look at the history of the enactment of Great Society programs in the Delta reveals that the Mississippi political power structure fought against the very changes those programs sought to confront.
The War on Poverty is often thought of as a program that tripled federal expenditures on health, education, employment and training, and economic security programs, all important to the Delta and other impoverished regions of the country. What is less well known is that the War on Poverty was also linked with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and leveraged federal funds to push for desegregation. This gave the government the ability to pressure local governments to reduce racial discrimination and segregation, turning them into pocketbook issues rather than social ones. That is why Mississippi’s congressional delegation fought so hard against the War on Poverty, including access to food.
Three powerful Mississippi legislators—John Stennis, James Eastland and Jamie Whitten—manipulated policies and programs at the intersection of agriculture, food, health, and welfare to maintain white supremacy and to thwart any efforts toward Black advancement in the Delta. The intense desire these men had to maintain white supremacy in the Delta led to policies that affected people far beyond it. But it is through the actions of Congressman Jamie Whitten that this desire to imprint white supremacy on public policy can be seen most profoundly.
Even before the Civil Rights Movement, Whitten had worked against the progress of Black Mississippians, particularly Delta residents. Beginning in the 1940s, Congressman Whitten used his legislative power to block several U.S. Department of Agriculture studies that attempted to identify economic problems facing Black army veterans returning from World War II to the South. The impact of Whitten’s legislative maneuvers also helped keep Department of Agriculture farm policy from considering the impact of its programs on sharecroppers or farmworkers. In the 1960s, Whitten used his power to ensure his district received $23.5 million in individual farm subsidies to reduce cotton production. These subsidies went to 0.3 percent of the population, yet in the same district, the 59 percent of the population living in poverty received only $4 million in federal food relief. This imbalance perpetuated poverty, food insecurity, and hunger.
Whitten also killed a federal program designed to teach displaced Black sharecroppers and farmworkers how to drive tractors and use the tools of farm automation that were displacing them. Rather than training people for the jobs that were part of the new agricultural economy of the Delta, Whitten effectively barred an entire group of people from those jobs. When Mississippi was placed on a Department of Agriculture list in 1967 that would have surveyed hunger in the state, particularly in the Delta, he got Mississippi removed from the list, which prevented millions of dollars of food aid from coming to the state and, thus, made living conditions in the Delta worse. The domination of politicians like Whitten supported the protection of wealthy white rural farmers in the South and fueled the resistance to civil rights and anti-poverty projects that could have changed the fortunes of the poor in the Delta and across the country. He was critical of programs like food stamps and opposed lowering their cost – on the basis of their income, recipients of food stamps purchased a monthly allotment sufficient to feed their family – arguing that “when you start giving people something for nothing . . . I wonder if you don’t destroy character more than you might improve nutrition.”  Never did Whitten acknowledge that farm subsidy checks for Delta planters were their own form of welfare, but only for the rich. Whitten’s legacy was to inextricably link federal farm, food, and welfare policy in ways that harmed poor people everywhere and not just in the Mississippi Delta.
Whitten’s power to control food policy persisted into the 1970s, which meant that Mississippi was excluded from any government-based intervention plans related to hunger and food insecurity even after Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs were being dismantled. Whitten’s drive to control national and state food policy contributed to the failure of the War on Poverty in the Delta. It also reveals the overlooked connections between food, white supremacy, hunger and poverty during the Civil Rights era. The logic of politicians like Whitten seems to have been that the only way to stop Black progress was to starve Black people.
Today, in the poorest state in the union, just under 1,600 families receive cash payments, even though over 100,000 families live under the federal poverty line. Cash assistance reaches only 4% of poor families in Mississippi who qualify for aid. Through a historical lens, the story of the Mississippi Delta begins to come into focus as a story of how we as a nation have failed the poor and allowed them to descend even deeper into poverty. The Mississippi Delta is not the poorest place in Mississippi or perhaps the entire nation because of the failures of its residents. It is poor by the design of its political leaders at the state and national level.

Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin is back in court making another effort to keep his estranged, adopted son from intervening in his divorce case.
In a pleading filed Wednesday with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Bevin’s lawyers are asking the court to vacate a ruling from Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson that Jonah Bevin, now 19, may intervene in any settlement reached by the wealthy ex-governor and his former wife, Glenna.
The appeals court in October had rejected an appeal of the matter by the Bevins, saying such an appeal could not be pursued until the case was resolved in family court.
While the Bevins’ divorce was finalized in March 2025, a proposed settlement remains pending while Jonah seeks to be a party, arguing he was neglected, deprived of an education  and sent to an abusive child residential center in Jamaica at 17.
Jonah is among four children the Bevins adopted from Ethiopia. They also have five biological children; all but one are adults.

Matt Bevin’s pleading argues that the family court’s ruling permitting Jonah to intervene — seeking educational services and child support — is clearly erroneous.
“Simply stated, there is no law in Kentucky that allows a child to intervene in his parents’ divorce case,” said the pleading styled as a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking emergency relief from a lower court.
But lawyers for Jonah said the action filed by the one-term Republican ex-governor is yet another delaying tactic.
“This is another attempt by this disgraced governor . . .to leverage the court system to conceal his conduct or delay access to justice and accountability,” said a statement from Jonah’s lawyers, John Helmers and Melina Hettiaratchi. “This is not the act of a family-focused man.”
It added that Bevin is using “extremist talking points” to deprive Jonah of resources, stating “Jonah simply seeks the support he is entitled to under Kentucky law and in the eyes of any caring parent.”
Bevin, a conservative Christian, ran for governor in 2015 on a campaign of promoting adoption and foster care, often citing his own family’s experience.
The Bevins’ lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Matt Bevin’s pleading states that unless the appeals court intervenes, allowing Jonah to intervene in the divorce settlement would cause “great injustice and irreparable injury” to the Bevins. It also “would create a dangerous precedent in Kentucky divorce cases going forward,” it said.
But Dawn J. Post, a New York lawyer and child advocate who first intervened to help Jonah after he was removed from the Jamaican facility, said the only danger is to Jonah if he is excluded from the case.
“Jonah continues to struggle today as a direct result of years of abuse, coercive control, institutionalization, abandonment, and effective disappearance during his childhood,” Post said in an email. “If irreparable harm exists here, it is not the product of judicial deliberation. It is the result of years in which a child’s needs were subordinated, his welfare marginalized, and his existence treated as an obstacle rather than an obligation.”
Post has said in a court filing that she spent three weeks in Jamaica in 2024 working on behalf of the youths removed from a brutally violent facility, including Jonah, and said the Bevins were the only parents who did not “engage” with the U.S. embassy or Jamaican child welfare authorities to assist in the care and return of their child to the United States. The case attracted international media attention after hotel heiress and celebrity Paris Hilton — an advocate for children in the so-called “troubled teen” industry — flew to Jamaica to aid the youths.
Bevin’s pleading also asks the court to rule before a family court case scheduled for March 27, saying it would cause “unwarranted public scrutiny regarding private family issues.” 
It added: “The divorce case has already garnered substantial attention from the media and general public, and that attention will only intensify if there is a public hearing pitting the former governor of Kentucky and his ex-wife against their adult son.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BEVIN-IN-COURT-1024x727.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:12:56.156231

State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, as promised, introduced two resolutions Wednesday — Legislative Resolutions 294 and 295. The first is a “notice of intent” for the impeachment article, while the second is the formal article. 
The push for her resignation stems from a Douglas County criminal case against O’Connor, 35. She is charged with one Class IIIA felony, driving drunk and causing serious bodily injury, related to a May 21 crash in east-central Omaha. That’s the same allegation outlined in the impeachment article. She was charged July 30.
O’Connor on Dec. 30 announced that she would resign effective 11:59 p.m. Friday. Spokespersons for the University of Nebraska system and Nebraska Governor’s Office said just before 10 a.m. Thursday that they had not yet received O’Connor’s resignation letter.
If O’Connor resigns, the impeachment process will end. If not, Kauth said she will proceed.
“As long as she actually resigns, Monday I will pull the LRs,” Kauth told the Examiner by text message.
NU Regent O’Connor resigning, effective Jan. 9, in wake of DUI allegation, possible impeachment

Nine senators had already co-signed Kauth’s article of impeachment: Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Barry DeKay of Niobrara, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, Loren Lippincott of Central City, Dan Lonowski of Hastings, Glen Meyer of Pender and Dave Murman of Glenvil.
Impeachment would require at least 25 votes. The case would then move to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which would decide whether to remove her from office. The Nebraska Constitution already bars convicted felons from holding office.
Neither O’Connor nor her attorney responded Wednesday to requests for comment. 
On Friday, NU regents will meet to decide whether to authorize the university to proceed with an $800 million deal to buy out Clarkson Regional Health Services’ share of the NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership and related Clarkson-area properties. It’s unclear if O’Connor will attend or if her vote will decide that vote, which the Nebraska Medicine board opposes. Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Prosecutors say O’Connor crossed into incoming traffic in a Benson neighborhood in east-central Omaha around 8:30 p.m. May 21. A passenger in the other car sustained a broken back and pelvis, according to police reports. 
Police say O’Connor tested with a 0.321% blood alcohol level, four times the legal limit. The criminal case continues in Douglas County District Court. She is next scheduled in court Jan. 22, and her case appears headed to trial.
If O’Connor leaves office, Gov. Jim Pillen would appoint her temporary replacement, and the state would hold a special election for the remaining four years of her six-year term in November, through 2030. She was reelected to a second term in November.

But what if you swapped out the person in the bucket truck for a helicopter carrying a giant row of saws?
For the next two weeks, Eversource is chartering a low-flying helicopter that’s giving a new meaning to the nickname “chopper.”
Outfitted with a long aluminum wire, this helicopter carries a dizzying (and somewhat alarming) array of eight rotating saw blades. The blades dangle under the helicopter, cutting trees along a transmission corridor stretching 12 miles from East Haddam to Middletown.
“It’s pretty impressive and cool to see,” said Daelon Carnelli, a climbing foreman, who cuts down trees close to residential homes.
Unlike Carnelli and his colleagues, helicopters can access remote, hard-to-reach areas where utility companies build transmission wires. The lines carry 115,000 volts of electricity from power plants to substations and, eventually, homes.
“This is the backbone of our system,” said Kathy Ferrier, Eversource’s supervisor of vegetation management. “If a problem happens on the transmission, it can affect the distribution system.”

Cue the chopper 
On a cold, recent morning, Carnelli stood by Eversource’s giant transmission lines in Middletown, waiting for a helicopter.
“Here he comes,” Carnelli said. The helicopter emerged in the distance, flying low and slowly, the saw blades suspended below it.
“I’ve seen it tons of times. It still makes me smile every time I see it,” he said.
The saw beam is carefully maneuvered by a pilot who sticks his head out the helicopter, moving it back and forth, slicing off tree branches that are within 25 feet of the transmission lines.
The actual saw consists of a beam with eight circular blades all oriented to create vertical cuts. The contraption is suspended on an aluminum wire. Credit: Tyler Russell / Connecticut Public
“These are young [trees] so that means they’re easy to cut through,” Ferrier said.
The helicopter makes quick work of cutting down the limbs, saving climbing foreman like Carnelli and his colleagues time and trouble.
“What he’s done this morning, we’d be here a couple days, close to a week,” Carnelli said.
Helicopters are also helpful in icy, slippery conditions that can make trees and access roads leading up to the transmission lines hard for crews to navigate.
“We’re eliminating risk to our climbers and our tree workers so they don’t have to climb every tree and work in these harsh conditions,” Ferrier said. “Cold and icy weather puts a lot of stress on the worker.”
Eversource has been using helicopters at various spots around the state to cut tree branches near remote transmission lines since 2020.
While the helicopters aren’t used in heavily populated areas, Ferrier said there is some concern from people who live near the transmission lines.
“We do a lot of outreach. We let people know about the project, we send letters, we go door to door, we let them know,” Ferrier said.
“They want to just make sure that it’s safe, and when it’s occurring. I think people just like to know what’s happening.”
Carnelli joked that the helicopters might one day put him out of a job.
“Times are changing. There’s cheaper, safer ways to do things now, I guess,” Carnelli said. “I’m sure we cost a little less than jet fuel.”

Kevin Steele, the wealthiest member of the Florida Legislature, is putting $5 million of his own personal funds into his campaign for Florida chief financial officer.
“Florida families deserve leaders who are personally invested in delivering results, not just talking about them,” Steele said in a written statement released Thursday. “Floridians are paying too much in property taxes and property insurance, while government continues to grow and waste taxpayer dollars. That has to change.”
Steele is running against sitting Republican Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia for the seat, in what is for now the most competitive statewide primary in Florida politics. Ingoglia was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to the position last summer, and was endorsed by the governor for the seat last month.
Ingoglia been gaining significant media attention since his appointment by traveling to some of the state’s biggest media markets with his FAFO (Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight) team. They’ve been auditing counties and municipalities, alleging that they have been wildly overspending over the past five years. It’s part of a campaign to push for a (yet to be written) constitutional amendment that would substantially reduce or eliminate property taxes for homesteaded properties.
Steele says that his campaign is also centered on lowering property taxes, along with addressing high property insurance costs and enforcing stronger oversight of state agencies to ensure transparency and accountability.
He is sponsoring a proposal (HJR 201) that would eliminate property taxes on homesteaded property. That resolution has advanced through two committees and has one more stop before getting to the House floor. It does not have a Senate companion at this point.
Steele, a retired tech executive, reported his net worth at more than $307 million in his 2024 financial disclosure forms. He said Thursday that his personal financial investment into his campaign “reinforces his independence and willingness to challenge the status quo in Tallahassee.”
“This campaign is about fighting for Floridians, not special interests,” Steele said. “I’m all in because Florida’s future is worth it.”
Meanwhile, Ingoglia said Wednesday that he intends to take his FAFO team back on the road to begin auditing the spending of local school boards.
“School boards should not be given a ‘free pass’ for their excessive and wasteful spending of your tax dollars,” Ingoglia wrote on his X account. “They should be held accountable also. Taxpayer dollars should be invested in kids and good teachers, not administrative bloat. Which school board should we FAFO first?”
While Ingoglia has the backing of Gov. DeSantis in the race, Steele is being supported by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott.
President Donald Trump has endorsed the incumbent Republicans running in the other two Florida Cabinet races on the ballot this year (AG James Uthmeier and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson), but has yet to weigh in on the CFO race. The Republican primary between Ingoglia and Steele takes place on Aug. 18.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas leaders approved a $12,000 payment for a former prison employee, settling a case accusing the state corrections department of disability discrimination and retaliatory termination.
Brady Greeve worked at three state correctional facilities in a seven-year span. Months after a motorcycle accident in July 2022, he was injured at work at the Kansas Juvenile Correctional Complex in Topeka, according to Greeve’s federal lawsuit against the Kansas Department of Corrections, which oversees state prisons, the juvenile complex and corrections employees.
His motorcycle accident resulted in mental and physical injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety diagnoses. The work injury exacerbated those injuries, said the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in March 2025.
Greeve missed several days of work in the months that followed the incident, but his supervisors — none of whom informed him of his rights under federal and state disability, workers compensation and medical laws — negatively docked him for his attendance, the lawsuit said.
In March 2023, Greeve asked his supervisors to allow him one day off per week. His request appeared to have been approved, but less than a month later, he received a formal letter reprimanding him for his absences, the lawsuit said. Greeve was surprised, and he confronted his supervisor.
The supervisor said, “It’s not my problem,” according to the lawsuit.
Coworkers “began treating (Greeve) differently by interfering with (his) work duties, being more critical of (his) work, and refusing to adequately communicate with (him),” the lawsuit said.
The “retaliatory behavior,” the lawsuit said, “intensified and increased in frequency” after Greeve requested leave and accommodations in March 2023.
Greeve was suspended for missing work. Upon returning, he filed another request, which he understood to have been approved based on conversations with human resources staff. But in July, the corrections department notified Greeve he was being fired for attendance policy violations.
The lawsuit said the corrections department repeatedly ignored or misled Greeve, forcing him to work and, in turn, exacerbating his medical conditions and pain.
Before the lawsuit, Greeve filed complaints in December 2023 against the juvenile complex with the Kansas Human Rights Commission and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. One year later, the employment commission notified Greeve he could sue.
Greeve alleged violations of state and federal laws related to discrimination on the basis of disability status and retaliation. Greeve initially asked for $300,000 in compensatory damages for emotional duress, lost wages, pain and suffering, and medical bills related to the duress or injury caused by the corrections department’s alleged retaliation.
Members of the State Finance Council, which includes the governor and legislative leadership, approved paying Greeve $12,000 to settle the case after a closed-door meeting. The council voted unanimously to approve the payment without revealing any of its discussion.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-08 15:49:07+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Inclusionary zoning in the legal firing line as Senate tries to boost policy,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/housing/inclusionary-zoning-in-the-legal-firing-line-as-senate-tries-to-boost-policy/,The legal and legislative moves set up a clash over rules governing housing development at a time when there’s broad consensus that the state needs to build more units across communities.,"JUST AS AN end-of-year lawsuit launched a broadside against a decades-old policy to boost affordable development, state lawmakers moved to make it easier for cities and towns to roll out their version of that same policy. 
A Cambridge developer is arguing that the city’s so-called inclusionary zoning program, which requires developers to set aside a number of units for lower- and middle-income people, is unconstitutional at its core. The suit aims to crack the foundations of inclusionary zoning in Massachusetts, adopted by communities like Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville.  
Meanwhile, senators struggling to make headway on a housing crunch across affordability levels are looking to pull all the levers they can, including lowering the difficulty of implementing inclusionary zoning locally.  
The legal and legislative moves set up a clash over rules governing housing development at a time when there’s broad consensus that the state needs to build more units across communities.  
Inclusionary zoning rules condition getting permits to build residential projects of a certain size on making a percentage of the units affordable. Cambridge credits its inclusionary zoning policy with creating over 1,600 units of affordable housing, and Somerville in 2023 described its policy as the “primary pipeline adding to the City’s permanent affordable housing stock.” 
But a lawsuit filed last month in Land Court by Cambridge zoning attorney and developer Patrick Barrett and the conservative Pioneer Legal Foundation claims that the Cambridge policy is unconstitutionally forcing developers to “surrender fundamental property rights” by selling their units at lower than market rate. 
Cambridge first passed its inclusionary housing policy in 1998. As the Greater Boston housing market surged in the mid 2010s, the Cambridge City Council ushered in one of the highest inclusionary zoning rates in the country — a 20 percent set aside for low- and moderate-income renters and homebuyers for new construction with 10 or more units.  
Somerville’s program has been in place since 1990, expanded in recent years to require 20 percent of low- and middle-income units in buildings of four or more units. Boston has managed an inclusionary development program since the Mayor Thomas Menino era in 2000. The city strengthened its requirements in 2024, lowering the number of units needed to trigger the policy and increasing the required number of affordable units.  
Housing production has slowed, even in historically strong markets like Greater Boston, which city officials attribute mostly to macroeconomic trends like the COVID-19 pandemic affecting supply chains and labor costs, and spiking inflation. 
In a statement when the suit was filed, Cambridge spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said the city’s Inclusionary Housing Zoning Ordinance “has become a model for other communities looking to create affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents and ensure the socioeconomic diversity of the community is reflected in new housing.” 
The lawsuit could take two years or more before a trial even starts. Yet over the course of the challenge, which targets the very nature of inclusionary development, lawmakers may kick open the gates for more communities to consider an array of inclusionary policies of their own. 
A showpiece bit of pro-housing legislation, shorthanded as the “YIMBY” bill, got the green light from the Senate’s housing committee in December. The bill would establish a statewide housing production goal, reduce the minimum lot size for new construction, and do away with parking minimums. But the version approved by the committee also includes new language that would allow municipalities to create inclusionary zoning policies by a simple majority vote of their legislative bodies rather than the two-thirds support often required in local codes. An earlier version of the bill, filed by Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn, did not include any provisions about inclusionary zoning. 
Crighton said inclusionary zoning is an important tool for unlocking affordable housing, and allowing the policy to be adopted by majority vote, not two-thirds support, would bring it in line with recent reforms allowing other zoning decisions to be made by simple majority. 
“It’s really difficult to make any of these pro-growth zoning changes with that super majority threshold, which is really not typically how democratic bodies should function,” he said. 
Some of the loudest pro-housing voices in progressive Massachusetts cities, however – proponents of “Yes In My Back Yard” building, or YIMBYs  – are notably cool to inclusionary zoning policies, which some say can slow growth by driving up developers’ costs.  
YIMBYs advocate for robust housing development at all affordability levels, but they embrace the supply-and-demand argument that significantly boosting production is the key to ensuring more lower-cost housing. They tend to oppose or at least voice skepticism of policies like inclusionary zoning that could in any way slow production of new units. 
The Somerville YIMBY group, comparing the downside risks of inclusionary development to a game of musical chairs, notes that San Francisco recently rolled back fees and inclusionary zoning rules as its housing market stagnated.  
“Inclusionary zoning helps lower-income people get chairs, and that’s great,” the group wrote, “But it also risks stopping the creation of enough chairs for everyone, which would only exacerbate the housing crisis.” 
Abundant Housing Massachusetts, the state’s major YIMBY organization, considers the sprawling pro-housing bill a priority because of other provisions. But the new language on inclusionary zoning caught YIMBYs off guard. 
“Inclusionary zoning at the right level can be an important tool for creating diverse communities,” said the group’s executive director, Jesse Kanson-Benanav. “But it has to be at the right level, and even in the strongest market we have in Greater Boston – Cambridge – inclusionary zoning without funding or benefits to developers is not working and producing the affordable housing that we would expect.” 
A standalone inclusionary development bill more in line with the YIMBY pitch was filed by Sen. Lydia Edwards of East Boston, Senate co-chair of the housing committee.  
Under Edwards’s bill, a community could by simple majority vote approve an inclusionary zoning ordinance or by-law that requires that up to 13 percent of units be affordable, so long as it will not “unduly constrain the production of housing in the area impacted.”  
Both Crighton’s broader YIMBY bill and the standalone legislation from Edwards were reported out favorably from the Senate housing committee and sent to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. 
“I understand there are concerns around unintended consequences from our partners in the YIMBY world,” Crighton. “And I certainly don’t want anything to be signed into law that could actually limit housing or have unintended consequences. So we’re certainly open to different ways that we could prevent this from being misused.” 
While the lawsuit plays out that challenges the constitutionality of inclusionary zoning policies, Crighton suggested there is support for expanding inclusionary zoning even if details need fine-tuning. 
“I think there’s still a lot of interest there,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6282-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 10:59:46.523638

“My heart goes out to the family, the students for the traumatic loss they have suffered,” Stein said. “The courts, of course, need to do their job to get as much justice as possible for Ms. Welsh, her family, as is possible.”
Welsh was killed Saturday in her home by an intruder. Police have arrested Ryan Camacho, 36, in connection with Welsh’s death.  Camacho has a history of schizophrenia and an extensive criminal record, local media reported, and court records show he’s been found incompetent to stand trial at least twice.
The state must make substantial investments in its mental and behavioral health systems, Stein said. 
“This includes more behavioral health, urgent care centers and better outpatient treatment and involuntary commitment options when other interventions are unsuccessful,” Stein said.
U.S. Rep. Mark Harris, R-NC8, criticized the Democratic governor’s remarks on social media, intimating that Stein doesn’t think the alleged perpetrator belongs in jail.
“Get this … Governor Stein believes that jail is not the place for a 20 TIME REPEAT CRIMINAL and alleged MURDERER!,” Harris posted on X. 
The governor’s remarks Wednesday were made during a NC Joint Reentry Council meeting. The council was launched by former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to coordinate state agencies to improve support and services for people returning from prison.
Stein noted that 90% of the people who are incarcerated in state prisons will eventually get out. 
“Approximately 18,000 people will leave incarceration this year alone,” Stein said. “Equipping folks with the tools that they need to succeed with their second chance, of course, it’s great for them, it’s great for their families. But it also helps all of us. Everyone benefits when every person meets his or her fullest potential.”
Stein said people leaving prison face tough choices, and state policymakers do, too.
“I believe we must do what we can do to reduce the barriers to successful reentry,” Stein said. “We must choose to support people when they reenter society so that they have the best possible chance at rebuilding their lives.”
The council’s Reentry 2030 initiative lays out several broad goals:

Improve economic mobility for previously incarcerated people.
Expand access to education, employment, health care and behavioral health services.
Ensure Medicaid coverage upon release.
Reduce the number of people returning to homelessness.
Remove barriers to successful community reintegration.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5157-1024x657.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 10:11:58.340329

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
With the position of Jackson mayor now held by a former colleague, many state lawmakers say they’re more eager than ever to help the metro area. But their ideas this session of how to do so might not be cutting-edge.
“We’re focusing on what we think are achievable, nonpartisan issues that don’t come with a big-dollar ask,” said Sen. David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson.

Help for Jacksonians with unpaid water bills, revitalizing the downtown economy and boosting the Capitol Police budget appear to be on the table.
Before the 2025 session, the House created a special committee on revitalizing Jackson, which ushered in legislation aimed at aiding the capital city, including laws to ban public camping, limit panhandling, hasten squatter removals and streamline developer efforts to eliminate blight. The Senate followed suit later, creating the Senate Study Committee on Jackson in October.
In 2026, Blount said the Senate’s goal will be to build on the House’s momentum through apolitical, inexpensive legislation.
To that end, Blount will be reintroducing a bill to move state agencies that rent property outside the capital city into vacant offices in downtown Jackson. Last year, his bill passed the Senate but died in the House. 
It’s not the most exciting concept, but Blount said the move will save state money and help revitalize the sleepy downtown surrounding the state Capitol building. 
“There are opportunities for consolidation and rents are cheaper in downtown Jackson,” he said. 
Also on the agenda are public safety, economic development and assistance for the city’s homeless population, said Sen. Walter Michel of Ridgeland, a Republican who represents parts of northeast Jackson and chairs the study committee. 
Michel said he is excited for the first legislative session that Jackson Mayor John Horhn will experience as a non-senator since the 1990s. Before becoming mayor in July, Horhn served for more than 30 years in the Senate, where he represented much of northwest Jackson.
“He knows the process, he’ll be nice to work with, and now people are going to want to help Jackson,” Michel said. 
Michel’s colleagues in the House feel similarly. In 2025, Horhn made his first appearance before the House Capital City Revitalization Select Committee.
Horhn raised several actions the state could take: provide funding for blight elimination in Jackson, approve a casino along the Pearl River and expand tax credits to developers. 
Former state Rep. Willie Bozeman, the city’s chief of staff, said Jackson will continue to push for legislative solutions to its thousands of blighted properties. But he won’t be satisfied with laws that lead to empty lots.
“Economic development also includes removing dilapidated properties, but replacing them with something,” Bozeman said. “We’re still trying to figure out the best way to do that instead of just tearing them down.”
The Legislature is likely to look at increasing funding to help the Capitol Police, which currently employs 150 officers, reach its goal of 180 officers, and the Capitol Complex Improvement District court, Michel said. He said his Jackson constituents are happy with the increased police presence and that he would be open to proposals to expand the patrol area for the state-run force once it is adequately staffed. 
Last year, lawmakers expanded the Capitol Police’s boundaries northeastward, encompassing several schools, the Kroger off of I-55, and Parham Bridges Park.

“Some of the senators and House members who represent areas (around the city) didn’t want anything to do with it, so I benefited,” Michel said. “I said my folks want more police protection, so that’s why we’ve been growing to the north.” 
As Capitol Police make more arrests, Michel said he will also be inclined to support funding for an additional prosecutor and public offender for the CCID court. He’s also interested in the possibility of funding a new booking facility in downtown Jackson to reduce the time officers in his district spend driving arrestees to the Hinds County Detention Center in Raymond. 
Further legislation to address Jackson’s homeless population is also on the table. 
Liz Brister, president of Downtown Jackson Partners, said at a meeting of Michel’s committee in November that Jackson receives homeless people from across central Mississippi because it is a transportation hub. 
“We’re really dealing with the state’s homeless population,” she said. “We see people get transported to Jackson from other cities, from other counties and even from the state’s Department of Corrections.” 
The homeless population is an example of how Jackson shoulders problems on behalf of its region, so Blount said it is only right for the state to help the city. 
But in a Legislature dominated by rural lawmakers, requesting more funding for one city, even if it is the state capital and the largest, can be a challenge. 
“It’s hard when you’ve got 48 people who don’t represent Jackson,” Michel said of the Senate.

On the House side, Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson, said he will reintroduce several pieces of legislation from previous sessions, including a successful law from 2021 that he says could help Jacksonians with unpaid water bills negotiate the amount they owe. 
In 2024, the third-party utility that oversees the city’s water system, JXN Water, began issuing disconnection notices to accounts with unpaid water bills and shutoffs at apartment complexes in 2025 caused some residents to be displaced.
But under existing state law, the utility is not empowered to forgive or wipe out existing debt, Aisha Carson, JXN Water’s spokesperson, wrote in an email. 
“Absent that authority, balances may only be classified as uncollectible for administrative purposes and cannot be written off or erased,” she wrote. 
That’s where Bell’s bill comes in. Enacted into law in 2021, it gave municipalities with more than 150,000 residents the ability to reach a “compromise” with customers who have unpaid water bills they cannot afford because of a billing failure. If the customer agreed to pay a prescribed portion of their unpaid bill, the municipality could place them on a payment plan and deem the remainder “uncollectible.” 
But the law automatically repealed in 2022 without actually being used, he said, because the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff were unable to create rules and procedures for the program. 
Were lawmakers to reup the legislation this year, Carson said JXN Water would like it to be “tightly scoped, one-time in nature, and paired with clear eligibility standards and accountability measures to avoid recreating the conditions the utility is working to move beyond.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27125015/3X0A3609.jpg,,,2026-01-08 10:11:58.340329
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Former New Haven police chief stole $10K. Who was keeping track?,Paul Bass | New Haven Independent and Mona Mahadevan | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/karl-jacobson-new-haven-police-chief-stole-10k-audit/,The scandal goes back six years. City officials were unable to say whether annual financial reports were filed or who was minding the store.,"The timeline of the police department’s confidential informant cash scandal potentially has stretched to six years — with officials unable to say whether annual financial reports were filed or who was minding the store.
That was the latest development Wednesday in the fallout from Monday’s revelation that now-retired Police Chief Karl Jacobson reportedly admitted to stealing $10,000 money from the department’s fund for paying cash to confidential informants (CI).
Jacobson resigned, put in for retirement, and admitted stealing the $10,000 as assistant chiefs and Mayor Justin Elicker confronted him about the allegation, Elicker said at a Wednesday afternoon press conference. Elicker appointed Assistant Chief David Zannelli (who was technically responsible for the fund under department guidelines) to serve as acting chief as both an internal investigation and a state criminal investigation take place.
Click here to watch Wednesday’s presser, at which the mayor and acting chief updated the press on the scandal. They said it’s unclear whether or not $10,000 was the extent of the missing money, out of a CI bank account that typically receives $75,000 a year from the general fund.
Jacobson has controlled the CI fund, including cash flow and reporting responsibilities, since 2019, according to Zannelli, even though Jacobson was supposed to hand down those responsibilities to the relevant assistant chief when he became chief in 2022. Zannelli said both he and his predecessor as assistant chief in charge of investigations, Bertram Ettienne, repeatedly asked Jacobson to hand over the CI money and the distribution responsibilities; he said Jacobson said they needed training first, then didn’t arrange for the training. (Jacobson has not responded to requests for comment.)
Do audit reports exist? Who watched?
Zannelli told the Independent Wednesday that so far officials have not seen any evidence of required CI fund annual cash audits since Jacobson took control of the fund in 2019 (when he became assistant chief of investigations). That search will be part of the investigation into the missing money.
“We don’t know. We have no reason to think so,” Zannelli said when asked if those six years of reports exist.
Under department rules, the assistant chief, not the chief, was responsible for preparing those audits.
At the request of the state’s attorney’s office, the city has sealed off the chief’s office in order to preserve evidence. That delays the department’s ability to search for documents like the audits, according to Zannelli.
Zannelli was asked in an interview Wednesday why he never submitted the annual report as assistant chief. (Zannelli, who previously was the assistant chief in charge of patrol, stepped into the role of assistant chief of investigations in January 2025, after switching roles with Ettienne.)
Zannelli said that was because the chief was controlling the fund — and because of what he called ambiguity in the city’s general orders.
“We had no reason at the time to believe the chief of police had any integrity issues,” Zannelli said.
Elicker was asked at Wednesday’s press conference whether anyone in government should have noticed over six years (the time Elicker has been mayor) whether or not CI financial audits were ever prepared.
“It’s a good question,” Elicker responded. “We are looking into this. Clearly this result is something that is not desirable. We want to make sure it never happens.”
Elicker was asked if he should have appointed Zannelli as acting chief before an investigation is complete into the CI fund, since Zannelli had technical authority of the fund according to the general orders. In the past Elicker has appointed the city’s chief administrative officer, who oversees the police department, as acting police chief after the departure of the chief. 
Elicker didn’t address the issue about Zannelli’s legal responsibility for the fund. Instead he responded, “I considered a lot of options. I’m confident in my choice. I’ve gotten to know and watch Chief Zannelli. He’s a strong leader. In every experience I have had with him, he has strong integrity. He and the two other assistant chiefs came forward under what any of us would imagine is a difficult situation [to challenge] someone who was their mentor, who promoted them to their positions.”
Elicker said that, over the course of 2025, funds were regularly withdrawn each month from the CI bank account in $5,000 increments by Chief Jacobson. “The only exceptions” to that, Elicker noted, are that Jacobson withdrew a total of $10,000 — in two separate $5,000 increments — in both November and December.
There is currently a total of $50,766.09 in the CI fund bank account. The city has frozen the account pending the ongoing investigation, which is being led by the New Britain state’s attorney’s office.
Who was responsible for audits?
The general order for the running of the CI program specifies that the assistant chief of investigations — not the chief — shall “keep a case account log reflecting all case expenditures.” That assistant chief — not the chief — is also directed to conduct “an annual audit” of expenditures.
The general orders do give both the chief and the assistant chief power to prepare a separate annual audit — not of cash expenditures, but of “confidential informant files.” It also gives both the assistant chief and the chief the power to approve reactivating inactive confidential informants.
Because the chief is given those powers in the general orders, that created ambiguity about whether the chief in fact had control over and responsibility for all required reports, Zannelli claimed.
“I don’t know how you can do one without the other,” he said of the conflicting language about handling CI files and handling CI cash.
Just to be clear, Zannelli referred to two separate parts of the CI general order delineating two separate responsibilities:

Section 4.04.04 has a section entitled “CONFIDENTAL INFORMANT MANAGEMENT.” That refers to an audit specifically related to handling of CI files: “An annual audit of the Department’s confidential informant files shall be conducted by the Chief of Police or his/her designee to ensure that they are being properly maintained, and that they contain all the necessary documentation.”
A separate section is entitled “MANAGEMENT OF CONFIDENTIAL FUNDS” with a subsection, 4.04.07, entitled “ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES.” It reads in part: “The Assistant Chief of Investigations will establish an accounting system for the Confidential Funds Account.  … An annual audit will be performed by the Assistant Chief of Investigations.”

The police chief is not mentioned in the second part. By design. In order to build safeguards into the system.
Would policy tweaks help?
Mayor Elicker said at Wednesday’s presser that the city plans to engage outside experts to help explore updating CI program guidelines. He said it’s too early to specify what changes would take place. “We’re committed to making sure this doesn’t happen again,” he said.
Acting Chief Zannelli said he plans to recommend to the Board of Police Commissioners that it make language in the general order more specific, to spell out which official has which responsibility.
It’s an important question: New Haven crafted its current CI policy in response to scandals over top cops stealing CI cash. (Click here for a previous Independent story about that.) National criminal justice experts in 2008 helped New Haven craft that policy, which was updated in 2016. A central tenet is that control over the CI cash and files should not rest with a single person without safeguards and multiple responsibilities. The intention was to prevent top cops from doing what Chief Jacobson allegedly admitted to doing.
University of New Haven criminal justice Professor John DeCarlo said that policy “reflects pretty much standard practice in the industry” with a reliance on “internal trust and annual audits.”
Studies from federal research agencies like the National Institute of Justice have shown that even with those policies, “cash-based funds are vulnerable when senior leadership of the department has authority that is concentrated and oversight is just internal,” DeCarlo said, without speaking specifically about what happened in New Haven.
New best practices include adding “independent audits, segregation of financial duties and surprise cash counts” to the mix, DeCarlo said.
“Without those, well-written policies like the one New Haven has in place could fail,” he said. As just happened.

DemasFour of Michigan’s Democratic representatives joined with Republicans from New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia on Tuesday in introducing a bill they say would close major regulatory gaps and strengthen government oversight on PFAS air pollution. 
U.S. Reps. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) introduced the Prevent Release of Toxic Emissions, Contamination, and Transfer – or PROTECT – Act alongside Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), and Jen Kiggans (R-Va.). 
If passed into law, the Protect Act would require the Environmental Protection Agency to classify PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, as hazardous pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
It would also require the agency to identify industries and facilities that release PFAS into the air, begin setting enforceable limits on PFAS air pollution from major sources and strengthen cleanup responsibility and public reporting when these chemicals are released into the environment.
PFAS, sometimes referred to as forever chemicals, are a group of man-made substances found in our water, soil, air and food, and break down very slowly, accumulating in people, animals and the environment. 
These chemicals have been linked to a number of negative health effects, including increased cholesterol levels, reduced immune system responses, interference with the body’s natural hormones, increased risks of multiple types of cancer and reproductive harms including decreased fertility and high blood pressure in pregnant women.
Michigan is one of the states most heavily impacted by PFAS pollution, with more than 300 confirmed contaminated sites and more areas where contamination is suspected.
“Michigan communities have lived with PFAS contamination for too long. The PROTECT Act closes dangerous loopholes in how these toxic chemicals are regulated, strengthens oversight of PFAS air pollution, and holds polluters accountable,” Stevens said in a statement. “This is about protecting the public health and safety of every Michigander and delivering real results for Michigan families.”
Fitzpatrick, who chairs the Congressional PFAS task force alongside Kiggans, Dingell and U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City), said the country’s clean air protections should reflect how pollution actually occurs. 
“PFAS ‘forever chemicals’ are released into the air and spread beyond their point of origin, yet they are not fully regulated as hazardous air pollutants,” He said noting that the bipartisan PROTECT Act corrects that failure by and strengthens the EPA’s ability to prevent exposure and protect public health.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)TOPEKA — The third full year of Kansas’ 988 suicide and crisis hotline revealed growing demand for intervention services available at five regional call centers, resulting in a recommendation to the Kansas Legislature for a significant increase in state funding.
The hotline was implemented nationally and in Kansas in July 2022, and monthly call volume went from a high of 2,287 in 2023 to 3,231 in 2024 and 3,796 in 2025.
In 2025, the latest annual report shows, monthly volume in terms of people reaching out for help ranged from a low of 2,487 in February to the high of 3,796 in October.
The annual report mandated by the Legislature, which was developed by the state’s 988 Coordinating Council, indicated the in-state answer rate of hotline calls remained above the 90% goal during five months of 2025. The low in 2025 was 83.7% in February, but the rate didn’t fall below 89.1% after March.
“The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is a critical resource for Kansans in moments of distress,” said Andrew Brown, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. “Whether someone is facing a mental health crisis, struggling with substance use or simply needs someone to talk to, 988 provides immediate, confidential support anytime, anywhere in Kansas.”
In the report to the Legislature, the state council recommended the budget cap for the 988 fund should be raised to $13 million from the current maximum of $10 million.
The council urged state lawmakers to identify alternative revenue sources, including the possibility of earmarking a percentage of state lottery or sports gambling revenue to the fund. The council raised potential of the Legislature adopting a dedicated telecommunications fee to provide stable funding for the Kansas network. Thirteen states and territories fund their programs with a telecommunications fee.
In addition, the council proposed the Legislature extend life of the state advisory panel beyond June 30, 2026.
The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in Kansas offers around-the-clock access to trained crisis counselors who work to help people experiencing distress, including thoughts of suicide, mental health complexities or substance use abuse.
The call centers in Kansas have been operated by HeadQuarters Kansas in Lawrence, Johnson County Mental Health Center, Wyandot Behavioral Health Network, COMCARE of Sedgwick County and HealthSource Integrated Solutions in Topeka.
The centers all reported challenges recruiting and retaining qualified staff, especially for 12-hour clinical shifts.

(Photo courtesy of Ørsted)Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general and the Revolution Wind developers are now taking on the Trump administration under one lawsuit rather than two.
Senior Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday granted the request made two days earlier by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong to consolidate their joint complaint with a similar case led by the developers of Rhode Island’s signature offshore wind project.
Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The decision cements a united front between the two state prosecutors and the international companies — including Danish renewable energy giant Orsted A/S — developing the 704-megawatt wind behemoth south of Rhode Island’s coastline. Despite being fully federally permitted in late 2023 and 87% complete, the 65-turbine project has been at a standstill since Dec. 22, when federal regulators issued a suspension order. 
The stop work order, which also applied to four other offshore wind projects along the East Coast, was met with swift backlash by state and federal officials, environmental advocates and labor leaders who decried the economic and environmental consequences for Rhode Island. Outrage mounted even more because it was the second time Trump’s anti-wind sentiment had forced work to stop on the project. Construction was already halted for a monthlong period starting in August when federal regulators attempted to pause the project under the guise of national security concerns. 
The initial stop work order prompted the two separate lawsuits — one from the AGs, and one from the developers who had already invested $5 billion into the project. Both complaints argued the Trump administration violated constitutional separation of powers, seeking court intervention to allow time-sensitive construction to resume.
On Sept. 22, Lamberth granted the developers’ request for a preliminary injunction, barring the Trump administration from intervening in the project, at least temporarily. Meanwhile, the AGs case has languished, first in Rhode Island and later, in D.C. where it was transferred on Dec. 11.
After the second stop work order, the project developers turned again to the courts, seeking a second preliminary injunction to continue the final stages of on- and offshore building ahead of a mid-2026 operational date. Rather than continue on separate paths, the AGs asked Lamberth to let them join forces with the developers, consolidating the two cases into one.
The combined legal fight will play out in a hearing scheduled in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom on Monday afternoon. Much like the initial complaint, the new legal filings argue that federal regulators have overstepped their power while emphasizing the consequences of the 90-day suspension order.
The developers estimate they are losing $1.44 million each day of the pause, with a $6 billion fallout and potential contract breaches if they cannot resume work by Monday, Jan. 12. Meanwhile, 200 union workers — out of 2,000 total employed through the project — are on standby. 
Rhode Island’s ability to meet mandated emissions reductions is at risk without resumption and completion of the project, which is also crucial to reliable and predictable energy supply for the regional grid.
The U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the Trump administration, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday morning. The Justice Department has until the end of the day to file its written response to the developers’ complaint. 
Also affected by the suspension order are Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind, both off New York’s coastline; Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking to resume their projects.

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit entered a new year with the same winter math: fixed incomes that don’t stretch, heat that costs more than many seniors can safely afford and food in their homes that runs out before the month does. For older adults, particularly older women, who are living alone, one delayed benefit, one utility notice or one missed ride can turn a hard week into a crisis — quietly, behind a closed door, without the public naming it as an emergency.
“You feel sad because you don’t want your parents to go through that lonely moment, a cold moment, a hunger moment,” said Joanne Crawley, a retiree who sees these crises unfolding every week through her volunteer work. “And it’s like, what can I do moving forward to help them?”
Older women are more likely to be on their own in late life, and that changes what winter looks like when money, mobility or family support runs thin. The Administration for Community Living, a federal agency that funds and coordinates services so older adults and people with disabilities can live independently in their communities, estimates that in 2023, 33 percent of older women living outside institutional settings lived alone, compared with 22 percent of older men. ACL also reported that 29 percent of older women are widows.
Anne Holmes Davis, vice president of planning and program development at the Detroit Area Agency on Aging, described who shows up when older women reach out for food help. “Most older women who come to the Detroit Area Agency on Aging for food assistance are often widowed, divorced or never married and living on Social Security or [Supplemental Security Income] SSI,” Davis said.
Davis said many are “unable to proactively plan for their basic needs while dealing with loneliness, poor social support and limited financial resources. They are more likely unable to navigate obtaining benefits and services on their own.”
The income gap that these women struggle with makes that isolation harder to survive.
A federal indicators report on older Americans puts the poverty rate for women 65 and older at 11.2 percent, compared with 9 percent for men. Black women are even more vulnerable — the poverty rate for non-Hispanic Black adults 65 and older sits at 17.6 percent. The Treasury Department has long documented how women’s earnings and savings often take hits from career disadvantages tied to the overrepresentation of women of color in lower-wage occupations and the underrepresentation of Black women in higher-paying jobs.
Crawley is 69 and a senior herself.
She has spent years volunteering with Focus: HOPE, the Detroit nonprofit founded in 1968 after the 1967 Detroit civil unrest, with a mission that names what it is up against: “Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, poverty, and injustice.”
Her route has run through Focus: HOPE’s Food for Seniors program, which provides monthly food boxes to participants 60 and older across Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, Lapeer, Tuscola, Huron, Sanilac, and St. Clair Counties.
Detroit often talks about homelessness as something you can see — a person outside in winter, a person sleeping in a car, a person carrying everything they own. Crawley keeps running into a different reality: older adults who still have a roof and still live through the same crisis conditions — hunger, unsafe cold, isolation — without the public ever calling it homelessness.
It can look like staying inside because transportation is unreliable. It can look like stretching medication and meals at the same time. It can look like living alone with a landlord who doesn’t fix what winter exposes.
Seniors don’t always say it plainly on day one. Crawley says they talk when they trust you.
“When the pandemic hit my daughter was telling me about this program,” she said. “I was just open and interested to be a help because a lot of seniors are home and they don’t have anyone to talk to. So, we were the people that they talked to.”
USDA’s Economic Research Service reported that in 2023, 9.3 percent of U.S. households with an adult age 65 or older were food insecure at some point during the year. For households where an adult 65 or older lived alone, the food insecurity rate was 11 percent. In Michigan, Forgotten Harvest reports 291,000 seniors 60 and older are affected by food insecurity.
Nearly half of them are in the Metro Detroit area.
“Living alone is not just a personal detail — it changes access. Solo agers are more at risk of food insecurity and they are more likely to be women over the age of 50,” Davis said. “Since they are more likely to live alone, they don’t hear about community resources and services available through faith-based organizations, non-profits and other organizations.
Struggles with utility costs show up in the same households. A Center for American Progress analysis found that in 2023, nearly 1 in 3 older adults — 14.8 million people — were “energy insecure,” meaning they cut back on basics like medicine or food to pay energy bills, kept homes at unsafe temperatures, or couldn’t pay an energy bill in the prior 12 months.
“The winter months in Michigan and Metro Detroit can be a particularly difficult time as utility bills rise,” Davis said. “The increased cost can make it difficult for food to last for the entire month, leading to skipped meals or even utility shut-offs.”
Davis also pointed to how hunger sits alongside other barriers: Her agency’s community needs assessment survey found that 20 percent of respondents did not have access to a vehicle and that more than 90 percent of caregivers — most of them older women — had not been to the doctor in the last year.
Frank Kubik, director of Focus: HOPE’s food program, says many seniors won’t voluntarily share how bad things are for them. He described what staff and volunteers do to understand the need without forcing someone to say it out loud.
“What we ask people to do sometimes when you’re delivering food is to ask if you can put it away for the senior,” Kubik said. “You don’t want to intrude, people sometimes don’t want to tell you their situations, and I get that.”
He explained the questions that could follow.
“Can I put it in your cupboard? Can I put it away in your refrigerator?” he said. “And then it gives you a chance to open up a cupboard or open a refrigerator and see what’s actually in there.”
Kubik described one home that has not left him, “A person had very little. And when I say very little, I’m talking about like a can of applesauce or something, and that was it.”
“How are seniors in this country living off a can of applesauce or something like that?… It’s just not right. It’s got to be a better way.”
The Social Security Administration estimated the average monthly retirement benefit for January 2025 was $1,976. For seniors on SSIe, the agency reported that in December 2024 the average monthly federally administered SSI payment for recipients age 65 or older was $576. All of which is supposed to cover rent, utilities, transportation, co-pays, prescriptions, food and the small costs that pile up quietly, including toiletries.
“It kind of just reminds you of how fragile things are and any disruption to whatever is already happening, whether it’s SNAP, whether it’s our program, whether it’s your Social Security check, it all has a huge impact,” he said.
Focus: HOPE’s Food for Seniors program exists because that stack of problems is real, and because someone has to meet people where they are, not where the system assumes they should be, Kubik said. Crawley has learned the same lesson from doorsteps.
The help that matters is the help people can actually reach, keep and use without losing their dignity in the process. Sometimes it looks like a warm meal. Sometimes it looks like groceries put away in a clean cupboard. Sometimes it looks like a conversation long enough for the truth to come out.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/detroit_seniors_weather.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:58:08.035160

(Photo from video by Joaqlin Estus/ICT)Alaska’s annual population estimate will be delayed almost a month due to last year’s federal government shutdown.
State demographer David Howell said on Wednesday that the state estimate isn’t expected until at least Jan. 28 due to the lack of required data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
The estimate is typically published in the first full week of January by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development and reflects information as of July the previous year.
While the department uses Permanent Fund Dividend data to hone its guess, it also incorporates Census data published annually. That data, normally available by the start of the year, isn’t expected until Jan. 27, Howell said. That means the state’s estimate can’t be finalized. 
The estimate is a barometer of the state’s economic and social health: When the state’s economy is booming and the Lower 48’s economy is stagnant, in-migration surges. When the opposite is true, more people leave the state than arrive.
Last year’s estimate showed 741,147 residents, the highest population since 2017, in part due to an unexpected surge in the estimated number of people moving to Alaska from outside the United States. 
If the new estimate is on par or above last year’s figure, it could be a sign that the state’s decade-long economic malaise is ebbing. 
This year’s estimate is also expected to incorporate an increase in military residents in and near Fairbanks, which could boost the Golden Heart’s population. 
In the long run, Alaska’s population is expected to drop because a lack of new arrivals has caused the state’s average age to rise.
That leads to a drop in the number of new births and a rise in the number of elderly Alaskans. By 2050, the agency expects the state’s population to drop by about 2%.

The UNC Board of Governors voted in May 2024 to formally repeal the system’s policy on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in favor of “principled neutrality.”
Still, equity has remained in the political crosshairs, with Republicans lawmakers filing multiple bills in the 2025 session to  prohibit the support, funding or implementation of DEI programs in state government and education.

Bart Goodson, the UNC System’s senior vice president for government affairs, told members of the House Select Committee on Government Efficiency that by the time President Trump’s executive orders on discrimination and DEI rolled out in January 2025, the system was ahead of the curve.
Goodson said each campus was advised on the remaining steps necessary to bring campuses into full compliance with the Trump administration’s orders.
“The guidance emphasizes the policies refocus on student success and reminds campuses of the constant, ongoing vigilance campuses must use,” said Goodson.
A memo from the system also mandated that all general education requirements that included completion of course credits related to diversity, equity and inclusion be suspended.
The system further mandated an annual campus reporting requirement with the chancellor’s signature to verify compliance.
To date, 59 positions tied to DEI have been eliminated and 131 have been realigned. The system estimates that the implementation of the equality policy across the University of North Carolina system has saved $17.1 million. The savings have been redirected to student mental health, military and veteran student services and academic advising, according to Goodson.
But efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion from higher education in North Carolina have not been quick or easy.
“We’re turning over every stone,” Goodson told committee members.
The campuses have manually reviewed more than 4,756 web pages, revised 1,270 web pages, and reviewed over 8,000 gifts, including scholarships and grants. Of those gift funds, 345 were flagged, 29 amended, with some spending paused. Funding from 85 foundations required working with individual donors to bring agreements into compliance.
“It takes a lot of manpower and a lot of man hours to review this information,” Goodson told the committee. “It’s a time-consuming area.”
Rep. Mark Brody (R-Union) (Photo: NCGA livestream)
Rep. Mark Brody (R-Union) said he’d heard from upset constituents whose sons or daughters were not accepted at their school of choice in the UNC system.
“If there are foreign students in these programs, that means that there are slots available for U.S. citizens that should have those slots,” Brody said.
“Our in-state students come first, not out-of-state, not international,” Goodson assured Brody.
Chairman Rep. John Torbett (R-Gaston) worried about the expense of the effort to root out DEI.
“My concern is, how much money do we have to expend annually to try to ensure that people aren’t trying to skirt the law?” Torbett asked.
Goodson said the UNC System is not requesting additional funding for the scrutiny. “But this wasn’t a one-time exercise,” he cautioned. “This is now an annual process that our board trustees have to be involved in, our chancellors have to sign off on.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UNC-CH_Photo_ClaytonHenkel_-1024x737.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Another Democratic hopeful, Kalispell-based former firearms executive Ryan Busse, has joined the primary race for the chance to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke. 
Busse, who ran an unsuccessful campaign to oust Gov. Greg Gianforte in 2024, announced today he is re-entering the political sphere with high confidence he can emerge victorious, in both a crowded primary field and in the general election. 
“We need to run somebody who’s run a big-time campaign, who’s done the work, and who’s proven they can raise the money,” Busse told the Daily Montanan. “I think I’m the best candidate for the primary, but, for me, this is about winning the general, and it’s about taking back the state.”
Busse’s first foray into politics was his gubernatorial race, but he had previously earned national attention from a book published in 2021 where he made the case that the firearms industry and the NRA are at the heart of the country’s political divide.
Republicans hold one of the slimmest margins in the House of Representatives in history, and recent vacancies due to resignations and deaths have further narrowed their advantage. 
That makes the 2026 elections even more crucial to both parties, as it will take just a handful of victories for Democrats to wrest control of the lower house, while Republicans need to shore up every advantage they have. 
In Montana, the state’s more competitive western district, rated a +5 Likely Republican election by the Cook Political Report, is drawing a lot of attention. (The state’s eastern district, represented by Rep. Troy Downing, is rated a +15 “Solid Republican.”)
Zinke won two elections in Montana as the state’s sole at-large representative before joining Trump’s cabinet in 2017. When the state split into two Congressional districts, Zinke ran for the western seat in 2022, winning by 3.5 percentage points. His re-election margin more than doubled 2024.
But that shift of voters towards the GOP — and the fact that a Democrat has not represented Montana in the House since 1997 — hasn’t stopped four Democrats from announcing bids for the western seat. 
On Monday, Missoula smokejumper and union leader Sam Forstag announced his candidacy for Zinke’s seat. 
The race already had two candidates who announced in 2025 — Matt Rains, of Simms, and Russ Cleveland, of St. Regis, who bring similar backgrounds as veterans and in agriculture to their campaigns. 
Busse said his decision to run came after polling data released by Tulchin Research, a California-based Democratic pollster, in recent weeks showed him with an early lead against Zinke.
While Busse said he did not pay for the polling, it was conducted to test the viability of a head-to-head matchup with Zinke and showed Busse with a 47-43 lead — within a margin of error of 4.76%— which goes up to an eight-point lead “after respondents were presented with balanced information about both candidates,” according to the poll summary. 
The poll, conducted among 424 likely voters in the district from Nov. 22-25, 2025, also showed Zinke has a net favorability rating of -7.
Notably, the poll did not ask respondents about a matchup between Zinke and a generic Democrat. 
“I can’t overemphasize how much this poll floored me — this is what we always hoped for in the gubernatorial race but never got,” Busse said. “I think this shows voters are ready for a change.”
In 2024, Busse earned just under 39% of the vote statewide in his loss to Gianforte, but earned roughly 43% of the vote in counties comprising the more moderate western district. However, in almost every western district county, Busse received fewer votes than Zinke’s 2024 challenger, Monica Tranel, who lost by eight points.
Despite the loss, Busse said he believes his campaign for governor gave him the name recognition and on-the-ground experience to reach voters, but that he understands it’s going to be a competitive race just to get through the primary. 
“I salute anybody who wants to put themselves on the line to take out Zinke and win the election,” Busse said. The crowded primary field “is what we anticipated, it’s how you know it’s a competitive seat.”
Similar to his gubernatorial campaign, Busse said affordability and public lands are two areas he wants to focus on.
The latter, especially, is likely to be a hot topic in the Congressional race, with Zinke’s background as a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term offering numerous policy stances for opponents to push against. 
Zinke has been a staunch champion for public land access over the last year, bucking his party to hold the line against federal land sales and co-founding the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus. 
“First off, I’m glad Zinke saw fit to finally vote for public lands,” Busse said. “But that’s pretty much showing up to work for Montanans. That should be the lowest of all bars to clear, but I do appreciate him doing it.”
In the last two races for the western district, a third-party candidate has received just over 3% of the vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/dems-govt-helena-110424-19-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota board has approved the issuance of up to $200 million in bonds for Rapid City-based Monument Health to support expansions and upgrades, as its rival Sanford Health builds a new hospital in Rapid City.
The South Dakota Health and Educational Facilities Authority voted in December to authorize the bond package for Monument. 
The authority is governed by a seven-member board appointed by the governor. The state created the authority in 1972 to issue tax-exempt bonds that help nonprofit hospitals and public universities borrow money at lower cost. Investors buy the bonds and earn interest as the borrower pays back the debt. The aim is to give South Dakota residents greater access to education and health care.
Sanford Health plans to build Rapid City medical center with $300 million gift

The tax-exempt status means the investors don’t have to pay taxes on the interest their bonds earn. That makes the bonds more attractive, in this instance helping Monument borrow the money at a lower interest rate.
Dustin Christopherson, assistant director of the authority, explained to South Dakota Searchlight in June that the board’s bond approvals do not involve public tax dollars, and the state has no financial responsibility for repaying the debt. The authority does not lend the state’s credit to borrowers. Instead, it acts as a conduit, allowing hospitals and universities to access the lower, tax-exempt interest rates.
Monument Health plans to use the bond proceeds for acquiring, constructing, renovating, expanding and equipping various health care facilities in the Black Hills region, according to a public notice of the bonding package. 
That includes up to $100 million for renovations, expansions and equipment at Monument Health’s Rapid City Hospital, where Monument plans to renovate and expand obstetrics, pediatrics, cardiovascular and clinical spaces. 
Up to $75 million is listed for the Monument Health Spearfish Hospital and clinic, including the construction of additional space for perioperative services, expansion of the existing emergency services and inpatient services space, and expansion of existing medical offices to include additional physician clinic space.

Other bigger items include up to $30 million for a new emergency hospital at 1911 E. Mall Drive in Rapid City, and up to $30 million for the Orthopedic & Specialty Hospital in Rapid City, including the construction and renovation of inpatient and outpatient spaces within the existing hospital and clinic facilities. 
The public notice for the bonding package lists $275 million worth of projects, but the total amount of bonding cannot exceed $200 million. 
“That provides the borrower with flexibility to finance more or less of a particular project but still limits the total amount of the borrowing,” Christopherson said in an emailed statement. 
The authority approved a $1 billion bonding package in June for numerous Sanford Health projects in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. In November, Sanford Health announced that it had received a $300 million gift from its namesake philanthropist, Denny Sanford, to support the construction of a 168-bed medical center in Rapid City.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_5999-scaled-e1717896387737-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

The move is intended to simplify California’s convoluted education governance, which policy analysts have said can be inefficient, redundant and sometimes at cross purposes.


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday proposed paring down the responsibilities of California’s elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction and shifting more power to the State Board of Education.
“California can no longer postpone reforms that have been recommended regularly for a century,” Newsom said, referring to numerous reports over the years that have suggested streamlining the state’s system of K-12 school governance. 
“These critical reforms will bring greater accountability, clarity and coherence to how we serve our students and schools,” Newsom said.
The move is intended to simplify California’s convoluted education governance, which policy analysts have said can be inefficient, redundant and sometimes at cross purposes. 
Under his proposal, the State Board of Education, an 11-member body appointed by the governor, would take over the California Department of Education. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction would have broader responsibility to “foster coordination and alignment of state education policies from early childhood through post secondary education.” The proposal didn’t offer further details.
For more than a century, the state’s public K-12 schools have been governed by a web of authorities, both locally and at the state level. In Sacramento, the governor, state superintendent, State Board of Education and the Legislature all share policy-making duties, which may shift every few years depending on the political winds. The Department of Education, under the direction of the state superintendent, is supposed to carry out those policies.
Locally, school boards and county offices of education also hold power over schools, especially since the state switched to a funding system about a decade ago that gives more flexibility to school districts. County offices, among other duties, are charged with overseeing school district budgets.
California has a somewhat unique system of school governance. It’s one of only nine states that elects a schools chief. In other states, the top schools officer is appointed by the governor or the board of education, according to research by Education Commission of the States.
Newsom’s proposal echoes a December report by Policy Analysis for California Education which called for an overhaul of the state’s school governance structure. 
“The need for stronger, more coherent governance has never been greater. Schools are grappling with fiscal challenges alongside deepening inequities, persistent opportunity gaps, and the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning and well-being,” the report’s authors wrote.
The issue is especially urgent, they said, as the federal government reels back its involvement in K-12 schools. President Donald Trump is in the process of shuttering the federal Department of Education, spinning off its duties to the states and other federal agencies. Federal education funding is also increasingly precarious, giving states more direct responsibility for educating children.
The PACE authors suggested several solutions, including the proposal that Newsom put forth. Under the PACE recommendation, the Department of Education would be run by an administrator appointed by the State Board of Education, and the superintendent would act as an independent advocate, with an eye on accountability. Most of the power and responsibility for schools would lie with the governor.
Previous proposals
This is not the first time the issue has arisen. Several ballot measures over the years — none successful — have sought to change the role of the state superintendent. In 2023, ACA 9, by former Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, a Democrat from Sacramento, would have made the position appointed by the governor. McCarty withdrew it amid opposition from the California Teachers Association, the California School Boards Association and other groups.
In his proposal, Newsom cited other previous reports recommending changes to state schools governance, including one from 2002 and another from 1920.
The state’s current superintendent, Tony Thurmond, is winding down his second term. During his tenure, the department has expanded literacy efforts, community schools, student wellness programs and other initiatives. He’s also faced criticism for working side jobs and creating a “toxic workplace.”
Thurmond, who terms out in 2026, is running for governor.
Newsom’s proposal has backing from a wide array of education players, including the Association of California School Administrators, California Association of School Business Officials, Californians Together, which advocates for English learners, and EdTrust-West, a research and advocacy organization focused on equity.
”For far too long, California’s fractured education governance system has contributed to persistent inequities disproportionately impacting low-income students, students of color and multilingual learners,” said Christopher Nellum, executive director of EdTrust-West. “EdTrust-West commends Governor Newsom for championing these essential reforms.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/033122-San-Antonio-Elementary-School-DR-CM-01-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C705&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

From CalMatters local news fellow Cayla Mihalovich:
California Democrats passed a batch of bills in 2025 to push back against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, and new ones are in the works at the start of this year.
On Tuesday Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes, a Democrat from San Bernardino, introduced legislation to prevent federal immigration agents from making “unannounced and indiscriminate” arrests in courthouses, which have become a battleground for the Trump administration to carry out its aggressive deportation tactics.

Gómez Reyes, in a statement: “The issue is clear cut. One of the core responsibilities of government is to protect people — not to inflict terror on them. California is not going to let the federal government make political targets out of people trying to be good stewards of the law. Discouraging people from coming to court makes our community less safe.”

The proposed legislation comes nearly two weeks after a federal judge ordered that the U.S. Justice Department halt civil arrests in immigration courts across Northern California, ruling that its deportation policies hadn’t addressed the “chilling effects, safety risks, and impacts on hearing attendance.” 
More bills: Other legislators introduced new measures this week, including:

Political violence: Prompted by the separate killings of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and Democratic Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, a bill by Assemblymember Laurie Davies, an Oceanside Republican, would add political affiliation to the list of characteristics needed to classify a crime as a hate crime.


Data privacy: Backed by Consumer Reports and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a bill by Assemblymember Chris Ward would prohibit data brokers from selling sensitive user information including immigration status, sexual orientation and genetic information. The proposal builds on two other data protection bills by the San Diego Democrat that’s currently before the Legislature.


Solar energy: A proposal by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco would cut red tape for Californians who want to install plug-in solar energy systems — smaller, more portable systems that residents can position on their balconies, patios or other locations.

‘License to Kill’ investigation leads to legislation

A coalition of lawmakers is planning a series of bills this legislative session to fundamentally revamp how California handles dangerous drivers. 
The action comes in response to License to Kill, a CalMatters investigation that revealed how the state of California has routinely allowed dangerous drivers with horrifying histories to continue driving and killing.
Assemblymember Nick Schultz of Burbank, a Democrat who is the chairperson of the Assembly’s Public Safety Committee, proposed a law Monday that would increase penalties for repeat drunk drivers. 
He said the bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a larger movement. 

Schultz, in an interview: “California has been behind the eight ball, quite frankly, compared to many other states in the country. We have got to do a better job.”

Details of other road safety bills are expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks.

Since Jan. 1, all California residents can access a tool that enables them to opt out of letting brokers use their data. Built by the California Privacy Protection Agency, the platform delivers privacy instructions to every registered broker at once. Read our step-by-step guide on how to use this tool by CalMatters’ Colin Lecher and Miles Hilton.

CalMatters contributor Jim Newton: The challenge that lies ahead of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is to persuade voters that her early stumbles during the L.A. County wildfires did not materially affect the city’s response, and to demonstrate that the city has command of the process now.
Stabilizing the insurance market, protecting ratepayers and fixing the FAIR Plan are essential if California is going to remain a place where people can live safely and securely, writes state Sen. Benjamin Allen, a Santa Monica Democrat who is running for Insurance Commissioner.

A tool called DROP lets California residents fill out a few forms to keep their personal data from being tracked or sold by data brokers.


The California Privacy Protection Agency kicked off 2026 by launching a tool that state residents can use to make data brokers delete and stop selling their personal information. 
The system, known as the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, or DROP, has been in the works for years, mandated by a 2023 law known as the Delete Act. Under it and previous laws, data brokers must register with the state and enable consumers to tell brokers to stop tracking them and selling their information. 
Until now, those instructions had to be delivered to each data broker individually — not an easy feat, given that more than 500 brokers were registered in the state as of the end of last year. Making things even more difficult, some brokers obscured their opt-out forms from search results, as The Markup and CalMatters revealed in August. 
The new system delivers privacy instructions to every registered broker at once. Launched on January 1, it is open to all California residents. By law, the hundreds of data brokers registered with the state must begin processing those requests in August.
Here’s how to take advantage of it.
Finding your advertising IDs
DROP asks you to provide some basic information — your name, email address, phone number, and zip code — so data brokers can find you in their systems. You can submit the form with just this information, but if you’d like a more thorough deletion, you can also provide your mobile advertising IDs from your phones, smart TVs, and vehicles. Including these IDs can help brokers match more of your data, but you have to take the time to collect them. 
Click here to jump ahead if you want to provide basic information only, or continue reading for instructions on providing mobile advertising IDs for:

Android phones and tablets
Apple iPhones and iPads
Vehicle ID numbers and smart TVs
Personal computers

Android phones and tablets
The steps below may vary slightly depending on your device and operating system version, but the general process is the same:

Open Settings.
At the top of the Settings screen, select the menu option with your name, followed by “Google services and preferences.”
Select the All services tab.
Scroll to the Privacy & Security section, and select Ads. Scroll to the bottom of that screen to get your advertising ID, which will look like a string of random numbers and letters separated by four hyphens. Save that ID for the DROP form.

Finding the mobile advertising ID on Android. Miles Hilton / CalMatters

On the same screen, you can find options to reset or delete your advertising ID. The CCPA suggests resetting your ID “because it breaks the persistent tracking link that advertisers, data brokers, and apps use to build long-term behavioral profiles of your device.” Alternatively, deleting the ID should prevent ID-based data tracking from happening at all.

Apple iPhones and iPads
Apple doesn’t provide a way for iOS users to see their mobile advertising ID, which it calls the Identifier for Advertisers, or IDFA. But it does provide a way for users to prevent trackers from accessing these IDs.
To turn off tracking, first, adjust your Screen Time settings:

Open Settings. 
Scroll down and select Screen Time. 
Scroll down and select Content & Privacy Restrictions. 
Scroll down and select Allow Apps to Request to Track.
Select Don’t Allow Changes. 

Then, adjust your Tracking settings:

Open Settings. 
Scroll down and select Privacy & Security. 
Select Tracking.
Toggle OFF the option to Allow Apps to Request to Track.

Apple has its own ads system that doesn’t use an IDFA. To disable that: 

Open Settings. 
Scroll down and select Privacy & Security. 
Scroll down and select Apple Advertising.
Toggle OFF the Personalized Ads option.

A quick note for our technically savvy readers: If you’ve already turned tracking off, you might be tempted to turn it back on to look up your advertising ID using a third-party app, but it’s unnecessary. Re-enabling tracking will reset the ID, limiting its usefulness to data brokers — they can’t continue tracking data or delivering personalized ads using a device ID that no longer exists. 
Vehicle ID numbers and smart TVs
Vehicles can track their owners in surprisingly invasive ways, and you can provide a vehicle’s identification number, or VIN, in case data brokers have that information. Where your VIN is will depend on the vehicle, but common places include on the dash on the driver’s side, or on a sticker in the jamb of the front passenger door. Your vehicle registration documents should also have your VIN listed.
Smart TVs also use advertising IDs. Here’s a guide that provides some settings for common brands. If the guide doesn’t cover your smart TV, try checking under its privacy or advertising settings. But be aware that this is different from numbers like the model code and serial number.
Personal computers
Laptop and desktop computers use unique identifiers to share data, but these are harder to find than mobile advertising IDs. Instead, you can turn off tracking, which will delete those IDs. (Turning tracking on again will generally reset the IDs.)

On computers running Windows, you can turn off your advertising ID by going to Settings. Depending on your OS version, select Privacy or Privacy & security. Then select General, and adjust your settings there.
On Mac computers, navigate to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising. Then, toggle off Personalized Ads.

The California Privacy Protection Agency also provides some of its own guidance on finding advertising IDs. 
Verify your identity
Go to the DROP website. You’ll be asked to accept the terms of use and be directed to a page that asks you to prove you’re a California resident. There are two ways to do so, and you can’t change methods once you’ve selected one of them. 

The system allows you to verify your identity using personal information through a system called the California Identity Gateway. If you select this option, you’ll be asked to provide some basic personal information, like a phone number, email address, California address, or your social security number. The gateway will use this information to attempt to verify your residency directly with the state. This option should be quick if you have an email address and phone number.
Alternatively, you can verify your identity to DROP using login.gov, a system that some federal and state agencies in the United States have adopted to allow residents to interact with government services. To sign up for a login.gov account, you’ll be asked to provide an email address, create a password, and provide photos of government-issued identification. After signing up and verifying your identity, you should be able to move on to the next step. This option might take a little more effort than the first option, since ID is required, but might be faster if you’ve already signed up for an account for other purposes.

Fill out and submit the DROP form
After verifying your identity, you’ll get to a form where you can submit multiple versions of your name, up to three zip codes, up to three email addresses, up to three phone numbers, advertising IDs from your mobile devices and smart TVs, and VINs for your vehicles. You’ll be asked to verify your email addresses and phone numbers with single-use codes before submitting. (The agency notes there may be delays with some verification codes due to high volume.)
A form on California’s DROP website. CalMatters
Once you submit the form, you’ll get a unique DROP ID to check the status of your request.
What happens now?
Sit back and wait. While the window for making DROP requests has opened, data brokers registered with the state aren’t required to handle them just yet. On August 1, brokers will begin processing the requests.
Starting then, companies have 45 days to process requests and 90 days to report back on how they handled requests. If they fail to do so, the companies can face financial penalties. 
In the meantime, you can monitor the status of your request with your DROP ID. At some point later in the year, when you log in the system should tell you whether your data was successfully deleted, whether records on you weren’t found, or whether companies believed the data was exempt from deletion under the law, which provides some limited ways for brokers to hold on to data.  
If you find more information while you’re waiting for your request to be processed, like a new mobile advertising ID, you can update your request with that information, increasing the odds you’ll successfully get your data deleted.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DROP-SYSTEM-Illos010526-DROP-SYSTEM-CM-GH.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

Faculty representation at Cal State is lagging far behind the growing number of Latino students. That burdens the small circles of Latino faculty who take on more mentorship tasks, many times in non-tenure positions and for lower pay.


In the last decade, Latinos in the California State University system have not made up more than 15% of all instructors, even as they made up nearly half of the student body in recent years.
Even at Cal State Los Angeles, where in 2024 a massive 75% of its student population were Latino, only about a quarter of its faculty were, according to Cal State data compiled by CalMatters.The number of Latino students has been growing at a faster pace, with all but one of the 22 Cal State campuses qualifying as Hispanic Serving Institutions — meaning at least 25% of full-time undergraduates are Latino, and a majority are low-income. Some Latino instructors say they carry additional weight where their small cadres are disproportionately sought out by Latino students for mentoring. This can also fall on the shoulders of part-time and full-time lecturers, who make up the bulk of Latino faculty, but are on a lower pay scale – even those who work full-time and take on extra duties.
“When you’re able to see Latinos that look like you, that maybe have the same starting point, lived experience as you, you’re able to see what is possible,” said Feliza Ortiz-Licon, who has long worked with first-generation college students and is now executive vice president of the Campaign for College Opportunity, a California nonprofit that advocates for equitable college access and completion.
Faculty say critical barriers into entering teaching include limited mentorship and lax promotion of programs that support them getting their doctoral degrees. Further, these programs offer limited spots. Underlying cultural norms have also dissuaded generations of Latinos from stepping into academia. Cal State campuses have continued their efforts to diversify the faculty, such as conducting cluster hires where groups of faculty are hired for their specific areas of expertise and backgrounds.
Still, these efforts have done little to increase the number of Latino faculty. 
As an example, in fall 2024, Cal State had 27,505 instructors but only 4,079 of them were Latino. To meet parity with the number of Latino students, the system would have needed 13,477 Latino educators.

Why are there so few Latinos in academia?
Amy Bentley-Smith, Cal State’s spokesperson, points to low national numbers of Latinos entering graduate programs. In 2023, Latinos represented only about 14% of graduate students nationwide, according to a Council of Graduate Schools report.
CalMatters attempted to speak with multiple officials at the Cal State Chancellor’s Office but the spokesperson said they were unavailable to be interviewed for this story. Instead, Bentley-Smith emailed the following response:“We have long been a leader in opening doors to opportunity and increasing access to higher education among all Californians, including historically under-represented populations,” Bentley-Smith wrote.She added that Cal State consistently exceeds the national percentage of Hispanic faculty — who made up about 6% of all full-timers in 2023, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Among the few Latinos with advanced degrees, 10% have earned a doctorate-level degree, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2021 American Community Survey data. A master’s is usually required to teach as a lecturer at a Cal State, and a doctorate is typically needed for a tenure-track professor position.In its research over the years, the Campaign for College Opportunity has attributed Latinos’ low educational attainment to high poverty rates, pressures to work and support family, and a lack of access to resources and information on navigating higher education.

And then there’s imposter syndrome. Since beginning her work as an academic advisor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s business college, Yesenia Marquez-Beas has seen countless students walk through her door feeling unworthy of success in the classroom. She finds those doubts to be far more common among Latino students than others.
“Maybe our Latinidad is holding us back a little bit to go out and seek positions that we see so far away,” Marquez-Beas said. 
Progressing through academia into teaching is rarely a part of the conversation when it comes to pathways after graduation, said Marquez-Beas.
Many Latinos live by certain cultural norms, Ortiz-Licon of the Campaign for College Opportunity pointed out. ‘No quiero molestar’ is one, which translates to “I don’t want to bother.” The approach keeps students reluctant to seek help or mentors, Ortiz-Licon said, once a first-generation student herself.
Anthonio Reyes, the president of Cal State Bakersfield’s student government, agreed that many first-generation Latino students have a “bad habit” of not speaking up about their issues. After high school in Bakersfield, Reyes attended San Francisco State, where he felt isolated and unable to seek help from his professors.“That’s a huge thing in the community, you just don’t ask for help,” said Reyes.
Reyes’ second year at San Francisco State was interrupted by COVID, when he went home and started working instead. He worked for four years before enrolling at Cal State Bakersfield to study music, where he found a more supportive environment.
That’s why as student government president, Reyes often tells campus leaders that they have to be proactive about helping first-generation students.
Shortfall creates additional weight on Latino faculty
As students tend to seek out educators of similar backgrounds, the gap creates a larger workload for a small circle of these instructors of color to address. And lecturers might take that on despite it not being in their job description.
“There’s a lot of cultural taxation. That’s the biggest problem with a lack of diversity in higher education, the diverse faculty take on more work,” said Dirk Horn, a Latino political science lecturer at Cal State BakersfieldThat can also bottleneck support for some mentees, eager to find someone culturally relatable.

“I have like a total of two Latino mentors that I’ve ever had, and I’m trying to build a connection with another one but she’s just so busy,” said Isabella Cantu, a Latina doctoral student studying sociology at UC Davis in hopes of someday joining the Cal State faculty.
José Navarro, chair of the ethnic studies department at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, believed as a student that education could be transformative but that pursuing higher education was like “walking into a really, really, really dark room” that he could not navigate on his own. 
As a tenured faculty, Navarro serves as an academic advisor and mentor on top of teaching. While at times he works late nights or from home, Navarro sees it more an act of necessity than a burden.
“The last thing I want is for some student of color to come in, just like I was, into that completely dark room that is the university system,” Navarro said. 
‘El muerto entre muchos no pesa,’ Navarro said, translating to, “a dead man among many does not weigh heavily.” He said that’s how he feels at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where Latino representation is limited, but the weight of service and mentorship is lighter when others are there to support.   
Latinos at Cal State are less likely to be in tenure-track positions, which are expected to be involved with academic advising and research. Latinos made up 12% of tenure-track faculty in fall 2024 while whites made up more than half. Yet, whites made up 20% of Cal State’s student population.
Tenure-track professors shape major university university decisions such as evaluating faculty hiring and promotion. They also have greater job security, Navarro said. Meanwhile, full-time lecturers are paid less and have a greater teaching workload.

But lecturers like Horn keep their doors open for their pupils voluntarily.
Horn assists the campus’ Academic Senate, serves on committees, and advises student clubs on campus, all without additional compensation. Without the possibility of tenure, Horn also feels uncertainty about his job security. He tracks state budgets and enrollment rates to assess the odds — in a fiscal deficit, would he be laid off first?
Getting more Latinos into academia
“I think more than anything, mentorship is important,” said Cantu, the UC Davis student. “Not just seeing the representation but feeling that support and having someone who understands your background, understands where you’re coming from.”
She credits mentorship she received from a national program, the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, for giving her the push to become a professor. She is now a fellow with the Chancellor’s Doctoral Incentive Program, one of two Cal State programs that help aspiring faculty obtain advanced degrees.
Horn, the Cal State Bakersfield lecturer, was also in the doctoral incentive program. It provided him with funds to focus on school while pursuing his doctorate at UC Irvine.
His journey to earning a doctorate degree was a rocky one. His father expected Horn to contribute to the family financially, so rather than enroll in high school, he worked full time while attending continuation school to obtain his GED.Five years after receiving his GED, when his father’s health was declining, Horn realized that a college degree might bring him — and his family — more financial stability. He attended community college and then transferred to Cal State Bakersfield, where he found mentors who encouraged him to attend graduate school.

Horn postponed graduating to join the federally funded Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, which helps prepare first-generation and underrepresented students for graduate studies.
Out of the 35 students accepted into Cal State’s doctoral incentive program this academic year, 54% are Latino, 24% Asian, 19% white and 3% Black, according to Bentley-Smith. The program offers mentorship, access to grants and financial awards worth thousands of dollars and professional opportunities for students pursuing a doctorate. They can also receive an optional loan that is forgiven if the fellow is an instructor at Cal State. Of the past program fellows, 69% earned faculty positions at Cal State campuses after earning their doctorate degrees.
Cluster hires help boost diversity — when there’s funding
Some Cal State campuses, such as Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo, have practiced cluster hiring to boost diversity among faculty. The process involves recruiting whole pools of faculty with diverse expertise and backgrounds. Ortiz-Licon, the higher education researcher, argues that such hiring of diverse groups “in community” increases their sense of belonging to their respective campuses, as well as strengthens retention of these educators for the long haul.
In fall, Sacramento State implemented its first cluster hire directly aimed at supporting Latino students. That semester, 37% of students there were Latino while 10% of faculty were Latino, according to the university’s institutional research database.
Rebecca Cameron, interim vice provost for faculty success at Sacramento State, said the university sought out faculty who had backgrounds in mentoring, teaching and researching Latino populations.
While Sacramento State hired 10 faculty across various departments, Cameron said two of the new hires for tenure-track positions previously held lecturer positions at the university.
Cameron emphasized the need to retain new cluster hires as sometimes she’s observed that faculty who are the first of a particular group in a department might get burnt out.
“It also continues to be really important that we not leave the work of inclusion [solely] to people who’ve identified a specific interest in it,” Cameron said.

In short, is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass doing enough to rebuild from the blazes?
To answer the question, it’s worth starting with one obvious but unusual fact: The Palisades and Eaton fires were, in one sense, identical, in that they erupted at the same moment, under the same weather conditions and just a few miles apart. 
But they are, in another important sense, opposite, in that the Palisades lie within the mayor’s jurisdiction and the Eaton fire outside it. That should help dispense with one critique of Bass, the argument that these fires could have been throttled in their earliest moments if only for swift action by city leaders, or that Los Angeles was singularly unprepared. 
If that were true, Altadena would still be standing, since it lies outside the orbit of LA’s leadership. The devastating damage to two areas with different political structures proves that political leadership was not to blame.
The same is true for the specious argument that a reservoir that was offline for repairs near the Palisades would have saved the area from disaster. The real problem with fighting the fires a year ago was high winds, which grounded planes and helicopters, not a lack of water supply — which was confirmed by a state analysis of the response and by firefighters on the ground. 
If the reservoir’s status at the time of the fire did not contribute to the actual damage, it did offer the mayor’s critics a political line of attack, which they grabbed even as the fires still smoldered. 
Rick Caruso, the developer whom Bass beat in 2022, latched onto the issue, but it was just a grasp for advantage and was — or should have been — beneath his intelligence. He continues his quest to be mentioned in stories about the campaigns for mayor and governor, considering each even as the political tide moves away from him.
Forces of nature
LA Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong also tried to make hay of it, only to be contradicted by his own newspaper’s reporting on the issue. Soon-Shiong has since retreated from public commentary on the fires and their aftermath; his public pledge to create a Leadership Council disappeared without a trace. 
Wind and brush are forces of nature, not politics, and absolve Bass of responsibility for the fires. Karen Bass is no more responsible for the Palisades fire than former mayors Richard Riordan was for the Northridge Earthquake or Eugene Schmitz for the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. They prove nothing more than that disasters are a fact of California history.
That said, mayors and other political leaders can and should be held accountable for how those under their direction respond in the aftermath of catastrophe. 
Again, comparing Altadena and the Palisades is illustrative:
A recent UCLA study concluded that 70% of homes badly damaged in the Eaton fire show no signs of moving toward reconstruction, and while about half of rebuilding permits filed so far had been approved, more than 25% were on hold. 
From the Palisades, meanwhile, the city has received more than 3,000 permit applications, has approved plans for more than 1,700 and issued permits for about 1,400. As with Altadena, that leaves many still under review, some 1,200 in the case of the city.

Broadly speaking, the city of Los Angeles is issuing permits in the Palisades somewhat faster than county officials are for Altadena, according to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times, which pegged the city’s average turnaround at 79 days and the county’s at 131 days. 
In other areas, the city’s response has failed to inspire much confidence. The city’s fire chief was quick to distance herself from the fire’s devastation, laying blame on others before being fired by Bass last year. 
And efforts to produce an after-action analysis of the event have been undermined by reports pointing to editing that softened some of the document’s language and conclusions. Some of the changes appear cosmetic, others more substantive. 
Despite the ultimate report being “watered down,” it presented a menu of reforms to better prepare the city for the next flareup. Some have already been implemented. 
For Bass, then, the political challenge ahead is twofold: to persuade voters that her early stumbles did not materially affect the city’s response and to demonstrate that the city has command of the process now. 
In that vein, her administration is attempting to present itself as transparent: The city has made public copies of the after-action report and the drafts that led up to it, and a city website charts progress toward rebuilding with regular, sometime hourly, updates. 
But reassurance is likely to be measured by optics as much as data. By fall, will the Palisades feel like a community regaining its strength, or will it remain hollowed out and empty? That, more than anything, may deliver the political verdict on this grave civic tragedy.
As for the judgments of history, they are mixed.
Mayor Riordan was widely praised for his response to the Northridge quake, and his steady resolve in those months helped fashion his image as a practical and, at least occasionally, effective problem solver. 
For Mayor Schmitz, the San Francisco quake left a different lasting impression. He ordered police to shoot looters on sight and reached outside the government for leadership in rebuilding the city. He was indicted the following year for corruption, and though ultimately acquitted, he never regained his former standing in the life of his city.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111225-Karen-Bass-Palisades-TS-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455
,California,2026-01-08 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Lawmaker targets repeat drunk drivers as part of larger push to fix problems exposed by CalMatters,Lauren Hepler and Robert Lewis,,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2026/01/californa-dui-law-reform/,The DUI bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a movement to address how California allows dangerous drivers to stay on the roads.,"In summary
The DUI bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a movement to address how California allows dangerous drivers to stay on the roads. 



A coalition of lawmakers is planning a series of bills this Legislative session to fundamentally revamp how California handles dangerous drivers, Assemblymember Nick Schultz of Burbank said this week.
Schultz, a Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s Public Safety Committee, released the details of his opening effort on Monday, proposing a law that would increase penalties for repeat drunk drivers. 
He said the bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a larger movement to address issues exposed by CalMatters’ License to Kill series. The investigation showed how, as roadway deaths spike, the state of California has routinely allowed dangerous drivers with horrifying histories to continue to operate on our roads.
“California has been behind the eight ball, quite frankly, compared to many other states in the country,” Schultz said in an interview. “We have got to do a better job.”
His new bill would make it easier for prosecutors to charge repeat DUI offenders with a felony, punish some of those drivers with longer license suspensions and lengthen their usage of ignition interlock devices, which are in-car breathalyzers that a driver must blow into for a vehicle to start. 
The proposed changes come after alcohol-related roadway deaths in California surged more than 50% over the past decade — an increase twice as steep as the rest of the country, federal estimates show. More than 1,300 people die each year statewide in drunken collisions.  CalMatters’ investigation revealed the state has some of the weakest DUI laws in the country and fails to enforce many of the statutes that are on the books.
Here, for example, a driver generally can’t be charged with a felony until their fourth DUI in 10 years. Schultz’s bill would let prosecutors charge a felony for a third DUI — a “paradigm shift” for sentencing, he said, that would bring California more in line with other states like Oregon, where he used to work as a prosecutor handling DUI cases.
The bill would also require any driver who gets a fifth DUI conviction within 10 years to have their license revoked for five years, and to install an in-car breathalyzer for four years. 
Schultz said the measure, and those expected to follow, would give the state a better system to identify dangerous drivers and intervene before it’s too late. His goal is to “bridge the gap” between the justice system and state regulators at the DMV. The effort was spurred, he added, by a combination of victims’ families calling for change and CalMatters’ reporting. 
“It’s grassroots, and I’m hearing about it in my community,” Schultz said. “The Capitol community is paying more attention to it because of the investigative reporting, and I think that’s a good thing.”

Other lawmakers are researching ways to keep reckless drivers off the road for longer, increase penalties for hit and runs and deadly DUIs, further expand breathalyzer requirements and modify the DMV’s point system. That system is set up to identify short-term clusters of dangerous behavior behind the wheel as opposed to long-term patterns. As a result, some drivers with egregious records are able to stay on the road.
Separately, Republican Assemblymember Tom Lackey of Palmdale plans on bringing at least three DUI reform bills in the upcoming session, according to his office.
Details of other road safety bills are expected to be announced in the coming weeks, staffers say, and will include a push for more DMV funding to address cost concerns. California was once a leader on these issues, but elected officials have proven reluctant to take on traffic deaths at a time when they’ve prioritized criminal justice reform and economic inequality, and the DMV has said it doesn’t have the resources to implement changes. 
The pendulum may be swinging. After recent high-profile crashes, officials and advocates across the state are amplifying calls to address dangerous driving. 
Last spring, high school tennis standout Braun Levi was killed by someone prosecutors say was a repeat drunk driver, just months after his family’s home burned in the Palisades fire. 
District Attorney Nathan Hochman last month filed murder charges against the driver and held a press conference calling on the Legislature, governor, DMV and judges to do more to avoid similar deaths.
Hochman highlighted many of the findings from the CalMatters series, noting that vehicular manslaughter isn’t considered a violent felony in California and referencing the fact that it’s one of the few states that don’t require first-time DUI offenders to install in-car breathalyzers.
“What other issue do we have where we actually have preventable deaths that we absolutely know will occur if we just keep doing the status quo?” Hochman said.
State Sen. Bob Archuleta, a Democrat from Norwalk and member of the Senate Transportation Committee, joined Hochman at the podium. Archuleta’s granddaughter was killed by an alleged drunk driver in 2024, and he has said he intends to put forward legislation to increase consequences for fatal DUI crashes.
“My colleagues in the state Senate, my colleagues in the Assembly, please work with us,” Archuleta said. “Because we’ve got to do some things that are gonna shake the trees a little bit.”
Braun’s mother, Jennifer Levi, made an appeal for more action at the press conference.
“California’s current DUI laws are broken and weak and fail to protect families like ours, and it’s devastating,” Levi said. “His death haunts my every breath, my every day.”
She said she’s committed to advancing legislation to restructure DUI sentencing and increase deterrence and punishment. Archuleta’s office said it’s finishing a draft of such a bill.
“This is not a political issue, this is a human issue,” Levi said. “I guarantee if any of you had to identify the body of your child or loved one in the manner that my husband and I did a few months ago, you would not be silent.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/111625-Traffic-Vigil-FG-CM-25.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

State Senator Benjamin Allen, a Democrat from Santa Monica, is running for Insurance Commissioner


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the second response. Read the other candidate response here.
The messages started flowing in: A fast-moving fire was tearing through the Palisades. Families I grew up with and had represented in the State Senate for more than a decade were told to evacuate with just minutes’ notice. We had just started the new legislative session up in Sacramento, but I knew I needed to get back home.
As I headed into town, the sky was lit up by the fire. The blaze was bright, red and hot. The smoke plume stretched for miles. We evacuated my mom, packed a go bag, and figured out contingency plans.
On the ground, it felt like a war zone. Ash coated the streets. The toxic smell of burned homes lingered everywhere. People stood outside evacuation centers staring at their phones, hoping for news that would tell them whether they still had a home to return to.
In the days that followed, my office was flooded with calls. Homeowners. Renters. Seniors on fixed incomes. People in mobile home parks who had lost everything and feared not only rebuilding costs, but losing their property rights altogether. 
Again and again, I heard the same questions: Will my insurance pay? How long will this take? What happens if it doesn’t? 
I got a front row seat to the dysfunction of our current insurance system. Our work went from helping people in the immediate aftermath of the fire to thinking about broader policy changes. This visceral experience of what so many of my friends, neighbors and constituents went through drove me to run for California Insurance Commissioner.
In the California State Senate, I’ve built a reputation for tackling difficult problems, and perhaps no problem in our state is as vexing as fixing our insurance system. It’s a system under severe strain, with the consequences falling hardest on those least able to absorb them.
Stabilizing the market, protecting ratepayers, and fixing the FAIR Plan are not abstract policy goals. They are essential if California is going to remain a place where people can live safely and securely. The current trajectory of the system threatens the future of our quality of life. And God forbid a disaster strikes, California must be a place where people can recover afterwards, rather than be forced out.
Stabilize the insurance market
Insurers need certainty to operate in California. Today, insurance companies wait years to get answers from the state, which creates instability that drives them to limit coverage or exit the market altogether.
We need to modernize how the state reviews insurance rates while preserving strong consumer protections. That means allowing responsible use of modern tools to predict wildfire risk and account for the actual cost of coverage, while dramatically speeding up state timelines so decisions are made in months, not years.
Faster does not mean weaker. It means clearer standards, better data and accountability on all sides. Stability also requires reducing real-world risk. Fireproofing works, but insurers price risk at the community level. 
As Insurance Commissioner, I would push for neighborhood-scale fire prevention and risk reduction programs that lower losses across entire communities and make it possible for insurers to responsibly write policies again. Many parts of the state are already implementing these programs, and they’re working. We need to scale these — and quickly.
Protect consumers
Californians are already facing unaffordable housing, utilities and insurance. They deserve confidence that every rate increase is justified and transparent. California law gives the Insurance Commissioner power to reject unfair rate hikes, and I will use that authority aggressively.
Protecting ratepayers also means standing up for people after disasters. After the Palisades Fire, I saw families forced to navigate slow and opaque claims systems while trying to rebuild their lives. That is why I wrote the law requiring insurers to provide significantly higher upfront payments for personal property when a home is a total loss, rather than forcing survivors to itemize every possession. 
We know we must do more. Among many things, we are currently looking into legislation that would create greater clarity and certainty with certain types of insurance coverage, including smoke damage post-fire.
Reform FAIR Plan
The FAIR Plan, the state’s backup insurer of last resort, was meant to be temporary but has tripled in size to now cover 450,000 residential policyholders. The program is driving up costs for all Californians who are being asked to bail it out.
In the short term, the FAIR Plan must be solvent and able to pay claims promptly, with improved governance and transparency. 
In the long term, it must shrink. Homeowners who invest in making their homes safer should have a real path back into the private market with assurances they can regain coverage if their communities become fire safe.  We also shouldn’t be building uninsurable new developments that are simply destined for the FAIR Plan and further public bailouts.
Standing in the Palisades, surrounded by smoke and uncertainty, it was clear what failure looks like. Insurance is not just a financial product; it is the foundation of recovery. Stabilizing the market, protecting ratepayers, and fixing the FAIR Plan are hard challenges, but they are solvable.

Ash rained down and smoke blanketed Los Angeles during the 2025 wildfires, leaving behind a toxic legacy in soil and homes. Without a federal or California mandate, nonprofit, academic and local groups offer testing for homeowners. 


As the Palisades and Eaton fires burned last January, and for weeks afterward, clouds of ash blanketed the city. Contained in that ash were  microscopic bits of heavy metals and synthetic chemicals from the homes that were consumed in the megafires. The Los Angeles hazards aren’t unique: they’ve become part of the wildfire legacy in wildland-urban interfaces throughout California. 
Modern houses are full of synthetic chemicals found in everything from paints and finishes, to electronics and upholstered furniture, to cookware. After the Camp Fire, a California Air Resources Board analysis in 2021 traced heavy metals like arsenic and lead that traveled in smoke from Chico all the way to San Jose. Last year, both in Los Angeles County’s fire-scarred neighborhoods and downwind of them, people wondered what exactly was in their gardens, yards, sandboxes and playgrounds – and raised questions about how risky it is to interact with the environment after a major wildfire. 
Yet FEMA, the California Environmental Protection Agency, and L.A. County chose not to perform soil testing. FEMA instead ordered that the top few inches of soil be removed from burned properties. Local government and non-governmental organizations stepped in to provide testing and education, but no clear standard for testing soil or cleaning up homes safely exists. 
Here are the answers to questions frequently asked by fire survivors as well as those who’ve experienced their fallout. 
Why isn’t there a safe standard for testing soil or homes? 
No federal or California mandate establishes one. FEMA had a policy of collecting soil samples to test for hazardous chemicals, but in 2020 reversed its routine. The agency made an exception in Hawaii in 2023, where there was a lack of baseline data about what was in the soil. 

How to obtain testing
CAP.LA will come to a property to do testing when a homeowner fills out this form and they say they give results in about a month. 
Residents can mail or drop off soil samples they collect for USC Clean’s project after they register online for an identifying number.
Separately, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health offers a drop-off soil testing program too, prioritized for people within the burn footprints of the fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.

Without federally-sponsored testing, local government, nonprofit and academic groups have stepped in: LA County Public Health set aside up to $3 million from their Lead Paint Hazard Mitigation Program to fund free soil lead testing for residents living within and downwind of the Eaton and Palisades Fires burn areas. The R&S Kayne foundation funded CAP.LA – the Community Action Project of Los Angeles – which connects people with free soil and water testing, as well as offering targeted advice for individual homeowners. Another soil testing project, USC Clean, is funded by significant grants from FireAid, a non-profit, along with support from L.A. Care, a public, locally-operated Medi-Cal managed care plan. 
What exactly goes into soils after a fire? 
Lots of substances get released when houses and cars burn, including plastics, chemicals, and metals. Metals can drop out of the ash and settle on soil, grass and trees – hanging around the local environment after structures burn. Lead may become airborne during a fire as toxic lead vapor or settle in ash and soil. That’s a worry because no safe exposure level to lead exists. Exposure to lead and other heavy metals can pose serious health risks, especially to children, pregnant individuals, seniors, and those with existing health conditions. When people touch contaminated soil or surfaces, hand-to-mouth contact is a hazard. 
How much do people need to worry about what fire leaves behind? 
When scientists did precise studies of the soils after the devastating 2021 Marshall fire in Colorado, they found higher levels of metals like lead, chromium, copper and zinc in the burned areas than non-burned areas – but overall the levels were below the threshold for danger for human health. 
But the risk is different for every property – so getting your soil tested is important. In Los Angeles County, CAP.LA has helped, and so has the LA Department of Public Health – which prioritizes properties located in the Eaton and Palisades burn areas for free soil testing – as well as the USC Clean Project. CAP.LA’s map shows aggregated self-sampling results for lead testing in soil. 
In general, the risk depends on how your soil and outdoor spaces are used. Young children who play in the dirt often are more at risk than adults. People who eat often from their gardens are also at a slightly higher risk – though overall, food from gardens is safe (with precautions), even after fires. 
Experts advise taking into consideration the frequency of your exposure to build a profile of your risk – with greater concern for is this a children’s play area or garden where you go multiple times a day compared to a burned building which will eventually be covered by a new foundation of a future house. 
What contamination could be harmful? 
Many parts of California have long had a problem with lead: lead-based paint and leaded gasoline left their mark on the landscape. Even before the fires, a study of 600 soil samples from urban areas across Los Angeles County found an average of 180 ppm of lead in soils. 
The California Department of Toxic Substances Control uses a level of 80 parts per million in residential soil as a screening level cutoff, above which concentrations may be unsafe for young children, fetuses, and pregnant people. That’s more protective than the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s threshold for safety, which was 400 parts per million before the Biden Administration lowered it to 200 parts per million in 2024. 
If soils have more than this amount, children should not play in them and people should make sure to completely clean any root vegetables growing there. Even if there is a lot of lead in the soil, it doesn’t mean there’s a lot of lead in your body – for the lead to wind up inside you, it means you’re ingesting dust or food or interacting a lot with the soil. 
What can I do to reduce the risks? 
Straightforward solutions can help the situation. For soil you can’t move, the easiest is just to cover the bare dirt with something else – mulch, woodchips, or even grass. Using raised beds or containers with clean soil for gardening creates a barrier between the contaminated soil and the clean soil for plants to grow in. Adding compost to soil can also increase populations of microbes and fungi, which help break down some chemicals in soil. Soaking vegetables in a 10% vinegar solution can take any remaining soil particles. 
Take off your shoes when entering your home, and make sure you’re washing hands and your pet’s paws after they are touching the bare dirt. Wet mopping and cleaning areas around the front door can also go a long way in keeping lead particles out.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

During Lance Shockley’s final moments in Missouri’s execution chamber in October 2025, he wanted his daughter, an ordained minister, by his side as his spiritual adviser. 
A few years earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court had expanded religious rights for the condemned, saying spiritual advisers could accompany them into the execution chamber and could touch them while praying aloud. 
But the Missouri Department of Corrections refused Shockley his chosen spiritual adviser, and he died alone.

It was the second time Missouri officials had denied someone their spiritual adviser in their dying moments. Yet, the state permitted eight other religious leaders to sit and pray within the death chamber during executions, an inconsistency that advocates said lacked compassion in the wake of the Supreme Court decision.
The presence of spiritual advisers at executions has been a question in several states. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has favored religious freedoms inside and beyond prison walls. In its 2022 ruling in Ramirez v. Collier, the court said a condemned man in Texas could have a spiritual adviser who was allowed to lay hands on him and pray out loud while he was put to death. 
The court’s 8-1 decision was rooted in the First Amendment and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which provides religious protections for incarcerated individuals. The justices urged states to adopt policies streamlining the process for allowing spiritual advisers into execution chambers. 
The Missouri Department of Corrections ignored the court’s advice and has not updated its execution protocols, which were last adopted in 2013. 
A lack of clear policies enables the corrections department to deny advisers arbitrarily, said Megan Crane, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization.
“We’re talking about constitutional rights in someone’s dying moments,” she said. 
The Missouri Department of Corrections has allowed some people to have spiritual advisers. In 2022, the Rev. Darryl Gray placed his hand on Kevin Johnson’s shoulder and prayed while he was being executed. Gray, a St. Louis minister, was the first spiritual adviser in the state permitted to sit with someone being put to death. 
Gray later said Johnson’s last words were, “They didn’t take my dignity.” As the drug flowed, he felt Johnson grow cold. He prayed before corrections officers led him out of the chamber.
Thirteen states have carried out executions since the Ramirez v. Collier decision, according to data compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization that tracks capital punishment in the U.S. But the way each state has handled spiritual advisers has varied. Some allowed an adviser even before the court’s decision. Others have updated their policies to spell out what spiritual advisers are allowed to do. Some, like Missouri, are vague. Theirs only says the person facing death can have up to two clergy members as witnesses. 

Questions have also surfaced as states adopt execution methods like nitrogen gas and firing squads. And what’s permitted on paper isn’t always what unfolds in the chamber.
Missouri uses lethal injection to carry out executions. Leonard “Raheem” Taylor, who was Muslim, wanted an imam by his side at his 2023 execution. The prison denied his request because he had previously signed a form saying he didn’t want witnesses. Taylor’s lawyers argued he had been told the form was for family members, and he did not want any relatives to witness his death. When the lawyers brought the issue up to the prison, they were informed it was too late. Court documents show officials gave conflicting deadlines for requesting a spiritual adviser. 
According to a letter from the warden, the imam had been cleared to visit Taylor on the morning of his execution, but he couldn’t be in the chamber “due to institutional security concerns related to changing the protocol at this late hour.”
Taylor died alone.
“I don’t think it’s very compassionate,” Kevin Schriener, one of Taylor’s attorneys, recently said. “I think arrangements could have been made.”
Shockley’s two daughters had previously been ordained and one of them is a full-time missionary. He wanted one of them to perform communion and anoint him with oil before the execution. He wanted the other to be in the chamber with him. 
The Department of Corrections has a policy allowing prisoners to request a spiritual adviser who’s also a family member, but said it does not apply to those under a death warrant. The prison denied Shockley’s request, saying that family members pose a danger because they could try to dislodge the IV line that delivers the fatal drug. 
Lawyers for Shockley, who was sentenced to death in 2009, noted that his daughters had been visiting him in prison since they were young girls without any issues. 
Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said a state statute prohibits relatives from serving as spiritual advisers to those facing execution. 
However, Joseph Welling, an attorney and professor at Saint Louis University’s law school, said the courts have never interpreted the statute to say that. 
Heidi Moore, executive director of Missourians to Abolish the Death Penalty, said the state’s failure to update its policy is a dereliction of duty.
The Rev. Jeff Hood, who has been a spiritual adviser to men on death rows in five states, said other states have a more defined process. But even when states allow an adviser, some have specific rules on physical contact. For example, in Oklahoma, the adviser is allowed to touch the person’s foot, according to Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kay Thompson. 
In 2024, Alabama introduced nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. Louisiana followed suit the next year. Both states enacted policies allowing spiritual advisers in the chamber, and they must sign a form acknowledging the risks should the gas leak. Their policies also specify when a person facing execution has to request an adviser. 
In the weeks leading up to Jessie Hoffman Jr.’s execution in March in Louisiana, the Rev. Reimoku Gregory Smith, a novice Zen priest, became his spiritual adviser. They formed a relationship based on truth, authenticity and courage, Smith said.
In the chamber, Smith knew he was not allowed to touch Hoffman. Instead, he sat a couple of feet away in a square that had been taped off. He was allowed to chant for five minutes — not enough time to finish the prayer — after the gas had been turned on. 
Smith said that spiritual advisers are important because they serve as compassionate witnesses. For him, that meant seeing Hoffman for the man he had become and, in his final moments, facing impermanence with him without fear. Smith officiated Hoffman’s funeral, where he highlighted Hoffman’s spiritual transformation.
In 2025, South Carolina began using firing squads. It also uses lethal injection. The person facing death can pick two witnesses — an attorney, a spiritual adviser or a family member. Most have selected their lawyer as the first witness, with the second choice split between a relative and a spiritual adviser, according to Jeffrey Collins, an Associated Press reporter who has attended the past seven executions since the state restarted executing people in 2024. Spiritual advisers have not been in the chamber regardless of the method, he said. 
Even when there is a policy, what happens in practice may not be what an adviser expects. 
The Rev. Bri-anne Swan wrestled with becoming a spiritual adviser to her longtime friend Ramiro Gonzalez in Texas. She worried that by agreeing to be his adviser, she would become complicit in his execution, an act that she considered abhorrent. Ultimately, she wanted to be there so that he would feel love in his final moment. 
At Gonzalez’s execution in 2024, Swan thought she had permission from the prison to hold his right hand, but when they were in the chamber, his hand was tethered to the gurney with a bandage, and she wasn’t able to grasp it. Not being able to hold his hand was one of the most heartbreaking parts of the process, Swan said. 
Robert Dunham, an attorney and director of the Death Penalty Policy Project, said spiritual advisers in the context of executions are a matter of constitutional rights — and human decency.
“It’s the decent thing to do, to comply with these religious requests,” Dunham said. “It’s something that states shouldn’t be opposing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/aeWZ1q6A-1024x536.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

(Getty Images)In the wake of the federal government changing its guidance on childhood vaccine recommendations, Utah health officials are telling Utahns to “determine which vaccines are right for you and your family” while awaiting final recommendations from a federal panel. 
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, new federal guidelines no longer universally recommend children receive six vaccines (to prevent rotavirus, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, meningitis, RSV, COVID-19 and influenza).  
Now, the Trump administration says those vaccines should be based on “shared clinical decision-making.” 
“It is not always possible for public health authorities to clearly define who will benefit from an immunization, who has the relevant risk factors, or who is at risk for exposure,” say the new guidelines issued earlier this week. “Physicians and parents, who know the child, are then best equipped to decide based on individual characteristics.” 
Utah’s measles outbreak, among the largest in the country, is likely to get worse

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, continues to recommend that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).
Asked Wednesday about how Utah health officials are responding to the new federal guidance, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a prepared statement saying it’s “aware of the changes to the vaccine schedules” recommended by the CDC, but that state officials are waiting for a final recommendation from a federal panel before implementing any changes. 
“We will await the final recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, (which) will meet at the end of February,” the DHHS statement said. 
Meanwhile, Utah state health officials recommended that Utahns consult with their doctors when making decisions about vaccines. 
“As is the case with all vaccines, DHHS recommends you work closely with your healthcare provider to determine which vaccines are right for you and your family,” the statement said. “Vaccines are a safe, proven, and effective tool for proactively safeguarding public health and preventing the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable disease.”
Colorado childhood vaccine recommendations stay the same despite federal changes

Medical groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics have opposed the federal guideline changes, calling them “dangerous and unnecessary.” 
“For decades, leading health experts, immunologists, and pediatricians have carefully reviewed new data and evidence as part of the immunization recommendation process, helping to keep newborns, infants, and children protected from diseases they could be exposed to in the United States as they develop and grow,” Andrew Racine, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement issued Monday in reaction to the guideline changes. “Today’s decision, which was based on a brief review of other countries’ practices, upends this deliberate scientific process.
Utah’s neighboring state of Colorado, meanwhile, is keeping its childhood vaccine recommendations the same despite the federal changes.
The Colorado Board of Health, in accordance with a 2025 state law, updated state vaccine guidance so that it could rely on science-based recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other authorities, in addition to the federal government. Colorado legislators passed that law out of fear that the Trump administration would make recommendations for vaccinations that are inconsistent with scientific evidence.

The department’s tracking website is updated weekly, he said. As of Saturday, 7.54% of emergency department visits presented symptoms of a respiratory illness, a decrease from 10.76% the week prior. Of those, most tested positive for the flu, followed by RSV, then COVID.
As of Wednesday, about 763,600 Alabamians were vaccinated against the flu for the 2025-26 season, more than double the vaccinations reported in November, according to data from ADPH. The doses administered is about 9,000 less than the total administered in the 2024-25 season, according to data from ADPH.
“I was pleased that the numbers were at least similar,” Stubblefield said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) track flu cases more intensively than the state department, Stubblefield said. According to the CDC’s FluView, there had been at least 17 influenza deaths in Alabama as of Dec. 27. 
There are many strains of the flu that circulate at different times throughout the season, Stubblefield said. According to the CDC’s FluView, all of Alabama’s reported flu cases have been of the A strain, which has multiple subtypes as well. 
“If people want the flu vaccine, we try to tell them that the flu vaccine contains multiple strains of flu. We do know that multiple strains are circulating the United States,” Stubblefield said. “It is possible to get the flu twice in a season.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Flu-and-COVID-shot-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

Public option plans cover the same essential health benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, but they are designed to cost less. They are accessible only through Nevada Health Link, the state’s ACA exchange, and their brokers and navigators.
The plans appear to be softening the blow of the overall skyrocketing insurance premium rates being experienced in Nevada and across the nation. For 2026 coverage, health insurance premiums on existing plans were approved for an average rate increase of 26%.
The public option plans “and the competitive pressures they bring are helping to temper the effects of those rate increases,” Nevada Health Authority Chief of Staff Allison Genco Herzik told the Nevada Current, “and data indicates that all rates are about 4.6% lower than they would be without the public option.”
For many Nevadans the public option plans are the cheapest available to them, though that isn’t universally true across the state, added Genco Herzik. One provider serving Washoe, Douglas, Lyon, Storey counties priced “very aggressively” and has plans less expensive than the public option plans.
That said, insurance plans aren’t expected to be cheaper this year than last year.
Weeks acknowledged to lawmakers that families may be forced into making tough decisions, like leaving their preferred providers or moving to a higher deductible plan.
Some health care advocates fear the rate of people going without health insurance will rise this year.
Weeks told lawmakers that 100,432 people were enrolled in a plan through Nevada Health Link as of Dec. 27. At the same point of open enrollment last year, 102,958 people were enrolled.
“We’re not that far off, surprisingly, given all the rate increases,” Weeks said.
But there’s a big caveat to those numbers. About half of those people were automatically re-enrolled into plans, said Weeks, “which means they haven’t quite gotten their bill.”
She continued, “When they get their first premium bill this month, we are likely to see… There’s going to be, probably, some fluctuation there.”
As of late December, Battle Born State Plans made up 8 to 9% of total Nevada Health Link enrollment, according to Weeks. That percentage is expected to rise through the end of the state’s open enrollment period, especially if people abandon their current plans with skyrocketing rates.
“I think we’re not going to have a good sense of where this all lands until we get through this month,” she said. “We could have people drop off.”
Open enrollment ends Jan. 15.
After that date, Nevadans will only be able to enroll if they have a “qualifying life event,” like losing existing health insurance or having a baby.
Weeks said the Nevada Health Authority is encouraging Nevadans to visit the Nevada Health Link website and shop for plans, or speak to a navigator who can help them compare options.
“Please encourage your constituents to not give up if they get a high bill,” Weeks told lawmakers. “We do have affordable products. They may not offer the same benefits but … We really want people to come in and shop and make sure before they decide that they are just going to disenroll and be uninsured.”
Weeks’ comments come roughly two weeks after Nevada Health Link declined to release enrollment numbers for the first month of open enrollment. The agency in previous years has directly released those numbers.
After publication, Nevada Health Link directed the Current to a Dec. 5 fact sheet published by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which reported that 18,786 Nevadans had signed up for a plan and just under 81,000 Nevadans had been auto-enrolled.
The introduction of a public option in Nevada has been years in the making. Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) in 2021 sponsored legislation to establish the option. It passed on partylines.
The following year it became a campaign issue, with then-gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo calling it “bullshit.” In his inaugural state-of-the-state address in early 2022, now-Gov. Lombardo said the public option needed to be “substantially revised, or better yet repealed.”
Later, in fall of 2023, Lombardo announced Nevada’s public option plan would continue to move forward but include a reinsurance program that brings down premium rates for both the public option and private option plans available through Nevada Health Link.
Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus (R-Wellington) and the National Taxpayers Union challenged the constitutionality of the 2021 bill in similar lawsuits in 2024 and 2025. Both lawsuits were dismissed by a district court.
Last month, Titus and the National Taxpayers Union announced they had filed an appeal with the Nevada Supreme Court. They requested the court review the case before the January implementation date. That did not happen.
Titus did not respond to the Nevada Current’s request for comment on the status of that appeal or reports from the Nevada Health Authority that consumers appear to be embracing the Battle Born State Plans.

Californians can now easily follow what their state representatives say and do each week, as the Legislature considers about 5,000 bills before adjourning in August.


CalMatters is launching a free tool that helps Californians follow, engage and hold their Sacramento lawmakers accountable in a powerful new way.
Our new tool is a personalized, weekly newsletter called My Legislator, which delivers key updates about your California state assemblymember and senator straight to your email inbox.  We track everything lawmakers say, vote on, and introduce, and more, so that Californians can keep up with their elected leaders, and so elected leaders are accountable to their voters.
Sign up for My Legislator. And if you need help confirming who your state representatives are, don’t worry, our sign-up process has your back. 
This session, legislators will consider about 5,000 bills before adjourning in August. Those bills regulate so much of Californians’ quality of life, as state legislators make decisions on K-12 and college education, courts and prisons, health care, the environment, transportation, housing and homelessness and the cost of living in the world’s fourth largest economy. The state has an annual budget of more than $300 billion, and it distributes another $200 billion each year from the federal government.
That’s why each week during the legislative session, My Legislator tells you:

How your legislators cast their votes (or if they missed a vote)
What they said
Historical context around who’s funding and influencing them
The bills they authored as they make their way through the legislative process
How they’re measuring up to their colleagues on bills passed, missed votes, bipartisanship and more 
Announcements from their offices
What the numbers mean and how the lawmaking process works

Last fall, we test drove our My Legislator for one month and beta launched it with just under 3,000 readers. The feedback we received was incredible:

“The My Legislators newsletter provides useful information that is not available without a deep dive and significant time investment.” -Bill, Petaluma
“I get emails from both my state and federal representatives. But they only report what they want me to know. The CalMatters My Legislators newsletter succinctly tells me about what bills they write, what they are saying in the media, and especially, how they are voting. This is so helpful.” -Tracey, Oceanside
“The information about my representatives in the My Legislators newsletter is very revealing. I knew none of it, despite being deeply involved with civic groups for some time. Thank you, CalMatters.” -Susan, Los Angeles
“I am delighted to get this knowledge about my legislators in the CalMatters Digital Democracy newsletter! I wouldn’t have been aware of any of this information if it weren’t for this service.” -Jeff, Vallejo

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-08 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Opening statements in welfare scandal trial paint former director as villain who doled out millions over infatuation,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/08/opening-statements-welfare-scandal-trial-villain/,"Ted ""Teddy"" DiBiase Jr. appears in a 2019 internal Mississippi Department of Human Services video message to agency workers.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
In the trial of former professional wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. about his alleged role in a brazen welfare heist, the prosecution and defense agree on the identity of the true antagonist in the scheme. 
During opening statements for the federal government Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie called the state’s former welfare director John Davis the “big villain in this case,” without whom, none of the crimes would have occurred. DiBiase’s defense attorney Scott Gilbert concurred, calling Davis a dictator.
DAY 1: 83 witnesses could enter the ring in Mississippi welfare scandal trialTRIAL PREVIEW: Ex-WWE wrestler faces feds in first – and potentially only – criminal trial in Mississippi welfare scandal
In 2018, in less than six weeks and in rapid succession, Davis helped secure four separate contracts for the wrestler’s companies totaling $2.5 million. The agreements pertained to services that Mississippi was supposed to carry out under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and The Emergency Food Assistance Program. None of this is in dispute.
The prosecution and defense also agree on the context in which this occurred. The Mississippi Department of Human Services is an agency under the control of the governor, and the governor at the time, Republican Phil Bryant, was clear that  he wanted Davis “to shrink the footprint of this agency,” Gilbert said.
“His marching orders from Phil Bryant were to privatize services at DHS,” Meynardie said. 
This resulted in Davis pushing out a large portion of the state’s TANF fund – as much as $40 million in one year – to two nonprofits to run a statewide anti-poverty initiative called Families First for Mississippi. The organizations were given wide latitude to dole out the money as they wished, so long as they also funded Davis’ desires, the government contends. Meynardie said one of the nonprofit directors, Christie Webb, will testify that she only inked the deals with DiBiase under duress, and that when she finally pushed back, she was punished.
Separate from managing unstable budgets, the nonprofits possessed nowhere near the manpower to wrangle social services across the state and deliver results, Gilbert said.

“It was an absolute unmitigated disaster, but John Davis, the dictator, didn’t care because he wanted to keep the governor happy,” Gilbert said.
Here’s where the stories diverge: The federal government argues Davis was not just a villain but also a mark — manipulated by the handsome charm deployed by DiBiase and his brother Brett DiBiase.
Davis had worked his way up through the lower ranks of the Mississippi Department of Human Services for over two decades before Bryant appointed him director in 2016, giving him control of a roughly $1 billion purse.
The prosecutor described Davis as a single, middle-aged man without any friends, “lonely by his admission,” and the DiBiases as two good-looking articulate young men who offered companionship.
“These two men showered affection on him, and he showered money back on them,” Meynardie said.
The prosecutor periodically read text messages between the defendant and Davis, including one in which the welfare director quipped, “I bought your love.”
Gilbert rejected this narrative, contending that his client never asked Davis for a job or a dime, nor did he lie, cheat or steal anything. “When you see the texts, you’ll see who’s the one involved in the chicanery,” Gilbert said.
Davis first met the younger brother, Brett DiBiase, in 2017 when the former wrestler was working as a copier salesman. Brett DiBiase then introduced Davis to his brother and his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., the famed retired heel of the WWE known as the “Million Dollar Man.” The welfare agency quickly hired Brett DiBiase as a director’s assistant — and his role was essentially to “follow Davis around,” Meynardie said. The agency also began contracting with the older DiBiase’s ministry called Heart of David.
Eventually, Brett DiBiase was out, and the welfare director began recruiting Teddy DiBiase to fill the role. Only, the federal government alleges, Davis couldn’t pay enough.
“He wanted the money, more money, more money, more money,” Meynardie said.
Gilbert said his client intended to carry out the services in his agreements with the nonprofits, and that any failure to deliver was a result of the dysfunctional set-up of Families First and unresponsiveness from Davis and others.
The Mississippi welfare scandal largely occurred in broad daylight and was the result of a government program with few  checks and balances.
“Hollywood tends to convey conspiracies as crooks in a room planning out something,” Meynardie said.
Think “Oceans 11.” But that’s not usually how it plays out in real life, he added. Sometimes, the conduct starts out lawfully. The criminal conspiracy may just “creep in,” Meynardie said, with actors eventually making agreements to do things they know are wrong. This is how he described this case.
After opening statements, the federal government called its first witness, David Barton, former director of internal audit for the welfare department. He spent roughly two hours discussing the agency’s internal controls, and how they were previously lacking, and is scheduled to return to the witness stand Thursday.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/06143853/tuesday-turnaround.png,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Democratic congressional candidates held a press conference Wednesday saying they feel confident in their prospects in the fall, despite running in districts that have tended to favor Republicans.  
Speaking at the Alabama Democratic Party’s headquarters in Montgomery, the candidates — including Clyde Jones for the 1st Congressional District in south Alabama;  Lee McInnis for the 3rd Congressional District in east Alabama; Amanda Puszcek for the 4th Congressional District running across north-central Alabama; Andrew Sneed in the 5th Congressional District in north Alabama; Keith Pilkington in the 6th Congressional District in central Alabama and U.S. Senate candidates Dakari Larriett and Mark Wheeler — said they would run on improving health care and what they called failures by Republican leaders in Washington.
“What we’re seeing is our Republican representatives in Washington are voting against the interest of their constituents, and their constituents are beginning to figure that out,” McInnis said. “So we are seeing a groundswell of discussion at this point that we’re all certain is going to turn into votes in November that will put Democrats in office where they haven’t been in a good long while.”

Democrats currently hold two of the state’s seven U.S. House seats: The 2nd district, represented by U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, and the 7th district, represented by U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham. But outside those districts, Democratic congressional candidates have struggled. 
Doug Jones, who represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate from 2017 to 2021 and now running for governor, is the only Alabama Democrat to serve in the Senate since 1994. 
The challenges for the candidates will be substantial, as many will be running against incumbent Republicans likely to have cash advantages in the general election. But those who attended the Wednesday event expressed hope for their prospects this year, the first since 2018 in which a Democrat will run in each seat. 
McInnis, who would face U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks if nominated, said he’s running to help his district obtain better access to health care services including access to trauma centers, mental health services and pediatricians.
“I began to see and realize that the 3rd Congressional District was not being appropriately represented in the US House representatives. We’re a rural district, so we face all the problems other rural counties face,” McInnis said.
Rural areas across Alabama have seen nine hospitals close with the most recent one happening last May.
Pusczek, a nurse, would face U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Haleyville if nominated. She said she’s running to improve health care as well.
“There’s not a district in the state that is not devastated or been touched between the cuts and the rural hospitals are getting closed. Medicaid, ACA, we’re all affected,” she said.
Sneed, who would face U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Madison if nominated, said his work in business led him to run for the U.S. House. 
“I worry about my guys. I worry about our company,” he said. “Everything costs too much. Everything’s getting a little too hard. We pay for their sick leave, and we pay for their paternity leave, and I pay for all their insurance, because nobody should be afraid to get hurt or be sick. I’ve lived that. But it’s not enough, and things are too hard.”
Larriett, running for Senate, said current leadership in the chamber isn’t adequate for Alabama.
“We deserve better leaders, leaders who know what the issues are and actually want to fix them,” Larriett said. “We deserve leaders that respect our First Amendment right and our way of worshiping. We deserve leaders that know the three branches of government and actually live in our state.”
Wheeler, also running for Senate, said after talking to Republican voters, many of them said they would vote for a Democrat.
“I can’t tell you how many Republicans stop and they want a deep, meaningful conversation, and they are so remarkably surprised that a Democrat is willing to stop, sit down, do something to draw them in,” he said. “And once you start having that meaningful connection, I would say one in 10 walk away saying they still couldn’t vote Democrat. The other nine 90% of those Republicans that walk up to me walk away saying, I believe in you. I can vote for you.”
Larriett said he’s focusing on engaging voter turnout in the state by meeting voters in areas they may frequent including churches.
Alabama’s voter turnout rate during the 2024 Presidential Election was the lowest in 30 years sitting at 58.5% of registered voters submitting ballots. The state has some of the lowest voter participation in the nation, due to a lack of early voting options and lack of competitive races.
Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, said the organization is working to ensure voters understand the importance of voting in every election.
“I think it has never been more clear that having a balance in government is important, and people are seeing that at the federal level more clearly than ever, that when one party controls everything, things can get out of hand fast, especially if there are no if we’re not putting the brakes on ourselves,” she said. “We have to be working together and balancing one another out if we’re going to have a government that actually serves the people who have a variety of different interests, but we are dedicated and passionate and motivated and prepared to get folks out to the polls in November.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8273-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

The candidate, who is in a three-way race for the Democratic nomination against U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), said Thursday that he would adopt those metrics if elected to ensure that the state’s large utility companies have some accountability to the public if data centers proliferate in Michigan.
A wave of more than 15 new data center proposals have come into communities across the state, El-Sayed’s campaign said in a policy rollout, including a 1.4-gigawatt facility planned by Oracle and OpenAI, which is being developed by Related Digital.

El-Sayed said he was concerned about DTE Energy and Consumers Energy requesting more rate hikes without improved grid reliability coming to the fore if key regulations weren’t in place, or if the community didn’t have equal ground to advocate for themselves.
“We’ve watched as data center projects have proliferated up and down our state, raising alarm and concern about the impacts on water resources, electric bills, and safety,” El-Sayed said in a statement. “That’s because our local utilities have bought off the politicians who are supposed to regulate them–and because there simply hasn’t been the leadership to take on powerful corporations. These terms of engagement represent the bare minimum that data center projects should be able to guarantee if they want to move into our communities.”
El-Sayed said the protections should include a guarantee for zero rate hikes, with data centers paying for their own energy demands and not passed down to ratepayers, with community transparency at the heart of any negotiations. The candidate said communities must have a meaningful say in the decision.
Reliability guarantees must be included in the conversation, as well as job guarantees and infrastructure that secures the environment. That includes facilities with closed-loop water systems to avoid polluting the environment or stressing local water resources.
Binding agreements for real community benefits must be reached with utility companies and the developers of new data centers, like tangible upgrades to the electrical grid, water treatment facilities, and piping.
There must also be no clean-energy loopholes to sidestep clean energy laws, and all of the agreements must be enforceable through what El-Sayed called actionable penalties.

(Photo by Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey should create an inspector general under the attorney general’s oversight, pass additional safeguards against conflicts of interest, and make it easier for residents to refer complaints to New Jersey’s top law enforcement official, a state commission said in a new report released Wednesday.
The Transparency and Reliability Uniting to Secure Trust Commission’s report and its recommendations are meant to boost public confidence in government while tackling corruption in the Garden State.
“The recommendations contained in this report are not a panacea, but they offer pathways for progress as the Department of Law and Public Safety continues its efforts to root out corruption and ensure that our government responds to the needs of New Jersey’s residents,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a letter attached to the report.
Advocates urge NJ lawmakers to protect transgender health care

Platkin is in his final days as New Jersey’s attorney general. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office on Jan. 20, and she has tapped former prosecutor Jen Davenport as Platkin’s successor.
The report calls for an inspector general within the law and public safety division — which Platkin’s office oversees — who would probe non-criminal fraud and abuses by government employees in an attempt at deterrence.
Unlike a recently stalled legislative proposal to shift some powers of the state comptroller to the State Commission of Investigation, which is partly overseen by legislative officials, the inspector general called for by the commission would leave other watchdogs intact.
The inspector general’s mission would have limited overlap with existing oversight offices, the report says. While the comptroller focuses on misuse of public funds, the inspector general would primarily target civil fraud and ethics or legal violations by state officials or contractors.
The Legislature should create the office of inspector general and grant it subpoena power, but the inspector general should use their discretion when deciding whether to release their findings to the public, the report says.
“The work of the proposed Office of the Inspector General would expand the ability of the Department to ensure that the government is worthy of the public it serves, holding it to the highest standards and rooting out wrongdoing even when it does not rise to the level of criminality,” it says.
A spokesperson for Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who sponsored the legislation to shift some oversight powers away from the comptroller, did not return a request for comment. Scutari had said that measure was intended in part to create a state inspector general position to field complaints about law enforcement.
New Jersey once had an inspector general’s office, but it was consolidated into the comptroller’s office nearly 20 years ago.

CJ Griffin, an attorney and transparency advocate, said New Jersey could always use more oversight but stopped short of endorsing the report’s proposal.
“In general, I think there should always be more watchdogs than we have,” she said. “Whether that means we need new, entirely different watchdogs or just expanding the staffing at our current watchdogs, I don’t know.”
Griffin has represented the New Jersey Monitor in multiple legal matters.
The report also calls for a compliance unit within the Attorney General’s Office that would ensure individuals or establishments licensed by the state — like police officers, health care workers, and liquor stores, among others — comply with state laws and regulations. The unit should report its findings to the public through an online portal that includes information about the requirements imposed on entities regulated by the state.
“Making the results of the Compliance Unit’s work readily accessible to the public will significantly improve transparency, showing the public that the government is holding itself to account on an ongoing basis, and improving the public’s trust in the government as a whole,” the report says.
The state should also boost funding for the public integrity and accountability office, an anti-corruption office that has been assailed by critics after some very public stumbles, and consider rolling that office back into the criminal justice division, the report says. Those offices were one until then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in 2018 split public corruption investigations into their own unit.
“OPIA frequently charges complex cases involving large amounts of data and documents, where defendants are often represented by well‐resourced defense counsel at high‐powered law firms. It is in the public’s interest for the only statewide criminal public corruption prosecutors to be well‐resourced and supported so that they can handle cases efficiently,” the report says.

The endorsed bills include SB 32, sponsored by Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, which would exempt households from paying solid waste collection fees if the sole income in the house comes from veterans’ benefits.
Alabama currently exempts households from paying such utility fees if the sole source of income comes from Social Security benefits.
The committee also endorsed HB 58 and HB 60, sponsored by Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, that would require courts in criminal and civil cases to grant continuance if someone who is connected to the case cannot attend the proceedings for reasons pertaining to military service.
State statute already allows the court to grant a continuance at the request of one of the parties in the case, but the two measures that Tillman introduced would require it.
It gives the same consideration to witnesses in the case provided that the witness is critical to the proceedings and if the individual is outside the state at the time of the proceedings.
The bill would also require that bail be set for defendants in such cases.
The committee also voted to support a package of still-to-be-filed bills backed by the Alabama Military Stability Foundation, a private, nonprofit organization that supports the state’s military installations, missions and families that was established in 2011.
Two of the proposals would expand scholarships to the children and spouses of military veterans. One lowers the disability rating for veterans from 40% to 30% to allow dependents to be eligible for the GI Dependent Scholarship Program. The program offers spouses and children of veterans with funding for college.
A disability rating is a measure of the severity of health issues that veterans experience while serving in the military. Reducing the disability expands the pool of veterans who are eligible.
The second measure expands the program to include medical degrees.
“There is a short list right now, this would expand the list,” Schmidbauer said. “This one, I think, is very important because, within the state of Alabama, we are short medical providers, we are short nurses, we are short doctors, so the more of our dependents and our children that we can get these degrees, it would not only benefit our military, it would also benefit our state because we would have more medical providers.”

(Photo courtesy of GE Vernova)While a natural gas power plant proposed for the site of a former coal plant in South Carolina’s Lowcountry has dominated recent headlines, there’s another gas-fired project in the works in the Palmetto State.
Duke Energy is in the process of seeking regulatory approval for a new, $3.2 billion plant in the Upstate.
“We’re at a critical juncture in preparing for South Carolina’s reliable energy future,” Duke’s regulatory chief, Heather Shirley Smith, wrote in an application making the company’s case to state utility regulators.
“Swiftly expanding our generation capacity is essential to keep pace with the state’s booming development and economic success,” Smith added.
The company is scheduled to go before the state Public Service Commission on Jan. 28 as it makes its pitch for the 1,400-megawatt plant that will employ 35 full-time workers just south of Anderson.
A final decision is expected near the end of April.
If the project receives all necessary approvals — which includes multiple permits from Anderson County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the state environmental agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State Historic Preservation Office, in addition to the Public Service Commission — construction could begin in mid-2027 with operations targeted for as early as January 2031.
A different plant
There are several differences between Duke’s proposal and the joint project on the banks of the Edisto River near Canadys that’s under pursuit by Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper.
For starters, it’s about 800 megawatts smaller than the joint build and is projected to cost nearly $2 billion less.
Dominion and Santee Cooper faced criticism after announcing the price tag for the Canady’s project had doubled — to $5 billion — from early estimates.
One of the major drivers behind the jump is increased demand for the gas-fired turbines that produce the power. As utilities worldwide race to build these plants, costs for parts have skyrocketed.
How a Greenville turbine factory earned a White House shoutout

“We are not the only utility building generation — states all around us are also experiencing growth and are meeting it by adding new natural gas generation capacity to the mix,” Smith wrote.
In the U.S., between 2024 and 2028, companies are expected to build 65 new natural gas generators, Duke executives wrote in their testimony. Surrounding states, including Georgia, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee, all have projects pending.
But Duke has already locked in a deal with GE Vernova in April to buy 11 turbines from the company’s Greenville factory. That’s on top of eight other turbines the utility said it had recently acquired.
The Duke project also won’t require construction of a new interstate pipeline to carry the gas needed to power the plant. The Transcontinental Gas Pipeline already runs through the Upstate less than a mile from the 193-acre power plant site.
Santee Cooper and Dominion’s proposed plant is contingent on approval of a $431 million dollar pipeline under development by Kinder Morgan to bring gas up from Georgia. Some environmental groups have raised concern about that pipeline’s proximity to the ACE Basin, a 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary named for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers that feed it.
About the Duke site
Pipeline could impact 185 SC landowners on route to proposed new gas power plant

Duke’s plant will only take up about a quarter of the total land at the site. The nearly 4 acres of wetlands and 7,400 feet of streams there won’t be disturbed.
There are also existing power lines, though they’ll likely have to be upgraded to handle a heftier electric load.
Duke had considered building at its existing W.S. Lee power plant site, also in Anderson County, rather than using previously undeveloped pastureland. However, that would have required 5 miles of large new transmission lines.
And the plant will be largely air-cooled. Rather than the 9.5 million gallons of water per day needed to cool the power-making equipment in a traditional gas-fired plant, this one will use a little more than half a million per day.
While Duke will be the main owner of the plant, five of South Carolina’s Upstate electric cooperatives plan to take a 7% ownership in the facility, buying about 100 megawatts of the power it produces. Cooperatives in North Carolina are striking a similar deal.
In exchange for the investment, Duke plans to ask Anderson County officials for a break on its property tax bill. How much the incentive package will reduce taxes is unknown. But the company, in its regulatory filing, wrote it expects to pay $16.7 million on average in annual property taxes for the first 10 years of operation.
Duke, according to its website, will hold an open house from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 26 at the Anderson Civic Center for residents seeking more information about the project.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ge_vernova_greenville-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

Greg Goode, the E-Verify bill's author, speaks in committee on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill to close “loopholes” in Indiana’s employment eligibility verification law could bar employers who purposefully flout the requirements from taking part in public works projects for a year.
“The law of the state of Indiana currently allows for individuals who are in the United States of America illegally to work on taxpayer-funded projects,” Sen. Greg Goode told the Senate’s Pensions and Labor Committee on Wednesday. “Let that sink in for a moment.”
He said Indiana Code hasn’t “caught up with” construction delivery methods, “creating some loopholes” that he claimed divert jobs away from citizens or those on the path to citizenship.
Goode, R-Terre Haute, wants to tighten state requirements through his Senate Bill 87.
Public work project contracts entered into or renewed after June 30 would have to include a provision requiring the primary contractor and all tiers of subcontractors to enroll in E-Verify, an internet-based federal program that cross-checks a new hire’s eligibility to work in the U.S.
The system compares information from the mandatory employment eligibility Form I-9 to records maintained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
Contractors and all tiers of subcontractors would have to submit an employee’s E-Verify case number to the agency overseeing a public works project before that person could begin work.

Under the legislation, employers that “knowingly or intentionally” fail to comply would be banned from public works contracts for a year.
“I had an instance in my own district — that’s how this whole issue came to my attention — where there was a public works project that hired individuals … here illegally,” Goode told the committee. “And I stopped to think, you know,  these are jobs that could have gone to people from Terre Haute or Brazil or Sullivan … I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”
Rob Henderson, the executive director of the Indiana State Building and Construction Trades Council, said the largest loophole “basically allows a construction manager on the project to self-perform” employment verification.
He said that provision applied only to state educational institutions at first, but was expanded and now is an option for “any” public works project.
Matt Bell, a lobbyist with the Associated Builders and Contractors of Indiana/Kentucky, acknowledged that’s a “glaring loophole” but said the legislation goes worrisomely further.
The group was most concerned the bill would make general contractors liable for what subcontractors — or the subcontractors of their subcontractors — do or don’t do.
“That’s a significant change in law, one that we’re very concerned about as we go forward,” Bell said.
He also characterized E-Verify as error-prone and argued the legislation wouldn’t protect employers from false negatives or positives despite the severe punishment prescribed.
“Employers acting in good faith should not be penalized,” Bell said. “I see no safe harbor in here.”

Indiana Department of Administration Commissioner Brandon Clifton threw his support behind the bill, noting it builds on an executive order from Gov. Mike Braun directing IDOA to update the state’s boilerplate contracting language with an E-Verify precondition.
“The one addition to the executive order presented in Senate Bill 87 is the verification,” Clifton said. “We are not currently verifying the use of E-Verify in our contracts. The contract itself is a self-attestation.”
But, he added, the fiscal impact remains unclear. An analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency predicted the changes could be absorbed without additional spending.
“Are we going to verify every staff member, every employee of the contractor or subcontractor? Are we going to audit a few of those?” Clifton said. The first approach would cost more.
The legislation was up for testimony only on Wednesday, not a vote, with changes possible next week.
“I think there were some very important questions relating to the enforcement piece, and I really want to make sure that we’re projecting fairness,” Goode told the Capital Chronicle. “Yes, we are articulating our standards of accountability, but I think that there’s a way to do this, to work with our contractors and subcontractors, to make certain that we don’t have to be overly heavy-handed.”
Goode said he’s still hoping to get it across the finish line despite a shorter-than-usual legislative session. The idea is already further along than last year, he noted, when it didn’t get a hearing.
Lawmakers have less than eight weeks to wrap up business. The General Assembly can meet until mid-March during a non-budget year, but leaders plan to adjourn two weeks sooner to offset the cost of the two weeks they spent on an unsuccessful congressional redistricting push in December.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday—after the agent fired through the window of her car—has renewed national scrutiny of ICE’s expanding role and the growing involvement of local law enforcement in federal immigration operations.
As federal immigration enforcement expands nationwide, a growing number of local law enforcement agencies, including in Michigan, are entering formal agreements with ICE, potentially reshaping the relationship between federal and local policing.
The Minneapolis shooting, reported as ICE officers were attempting to stop a vehicle, has intensified concerns among civil rights advocates about accountability, use of force, and the spillover effects of immigration enforcement into routine policing.

Since October 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security began offering financial incentives such as salary reimbursements and performance-based awards, participation in ICE’s 287(g) program has accelerated. 
In Michigan, where seven agencies have signed agreements under different enforcement models, police chiefs and sheriffs say the partnerships largely formalize long-standing cooperation with federal authorities—setting the stage for renewed scrutiny of a program with a long and contested history.
Separate federal offices used to administer immigration and naturalization in the United States. They were consolidated into the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, in 1933, initially under the Department of Labor, later transferred under the Department of Justice in 1940.
The INS rebranded as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and moved under the auspices of the newly established Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Section 287(g) was added to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1996, and outlined how state and local law enforcement agencies could establish agreements with INS/ICE. These agreements allow local law enforcement officers to “perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across State lines to detention centers).”
Recent data released by ICE shows active agreements dating back to 2019, when law enforcement agencies in Florida began signing up, followed by Texas and other states later that year. To date, Florida and Texas law enforcement agencies comprise more than 60% of those with agreements in place.
As of December 30, 2025, ICE reported maintaining 1,274 agreements with 975 agencies in 46 states—some agencies maintain several agreements, as they take several forms, or models.

Models, training and certification
Existing agreements fall under three models: jail enforcement, warrant service officer and task force. A fourth model, tribal task force, was added in December 2025. All but 134 of the active agreements were signed after the Trump administration brought back the task force model, which had been discontinued in 2012 after the Department of Justice (in North Carolina and Arizona) and independent researchers found cases of racial profiling and patterns of constitutional violations.
More than half of agreements in place today are under the task force model.

The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office has the oldest active 287(g) agreement in Michigan, having signed in March 2025 under the warrant service officer model. The sheriff’s offices in Berrien and Calhoun counties later joined under the same model.
“The jail enforcement model requires deputies to attend training out of state and with current staffing levels we did not see this as a good option for us at this time,” said Berrien County Sheriff Chuck Heit. “The task force model also requires extensive training out of state and would then give us the authority to enforce immigration law ourselves, which is not an option I am interested in at this time.”
The warrant service model requires the least training.
“This program only pertains to individuals who are in our custody at the Berrien County Jail,” said Heit.
He said the program would streamline processes already in place to execute ICE administrative warrants.
“We have cooperated with ICE for over 20 years in holding inmates for up to 48 hours,” he said. “The safest way to deal with an immigration warrant is when the individual is already in custody.”
In late December, both Heit and Jackson County Sheriff Gary R. Schuette said they were still waiting for ICE to complete training for jail staff.
“It’s kind of on them,” said Schuette. “Ball’s in their court.”
“We are looking at getting six of our staff trained in the warrant service officer program,” said Heit. “We are looking for this training to occur in early 2026.”
Local immigration enforcement in theory and practice
Located south of Detroit, the City of Taylor Police Department signed the oldest active 287(g) memorandum of agreement in Michigan under the task force model, entering the MOA in late April 2025. Sheriffs in Roscommon and Crawford counties followed, while in nearby Ogemaw County, in November 2025, the City of West Branch became the most recent agency in Michigan to sign a 287(g) task force MOA.
The task force model requires the most training and the agreement language authorizes a number of immigration enforcement actions for a certified local law enforcement officer. These include arresting and interrogating suspected aliens without a warrant, serving and executing warrants of arrest for immigration violations, taking and maintaining custody of and transporting aliens arrested by ICE.
Police chiefs in West Branch and Taylor said the program has not impacted their operations.
“287(g) doesn’t change a thing,” said Taylor Police Chief John Blair. “If we come into contact with someone who’s in the country illegally, we’ll contact ICE.”
Blair’s career in law enforcement involved coordinating with Customs and Border Patrol before ICE was established. He said cooperation with federal agencies, which themselves support local law enforcement, is natural.
He also acknowledged that training and certification present a challenge.
“The training is free but they’re not paying your guys to go to the training,” he said. “Time away from the responsibilities was a problem.”
“It doesn’t change anything that we do now,” said West Branch Police Chief Ken Walters, responding to a local resident at a city council meeting. “If we come into contact with an illegal alien right now on a criminal complaint—traffic crimes, any of that—that individual has always been taken into custody. Then they’re lodged in the county jail and then border patrol or DHS [ICE] would come and get them from the jail. The only difference is in the cooperative agreement, we’d do the transport to their facility.”

Perspectives on the 287(g) program
The Genesee County Sheriff’s Office and City of Center Line Police Department had signed MOAs earlier in fall 2025 but quickly rescinded them, the former citing changes in staffing duties. In Center Line, the mayor and city council withdrew from the agreement after public pressure.
“After listening to the public comments and discussing the 287(g) MOU with City Council members and the Mayor of Center Line, the City Manager has determined that it is in the City’s best interest to withdraw its MOA with ICE,” said the city in a public statement.
Berrien County Sheriff Chuck Heit, like Taylor Police Chief John Blair, reported a healthy working relationship with federal agencies.
“We have cooperated with ICE for over 20 years in holding inmates for them who have a valid hold just like we do for other agencies and jurisdictions,” he said. “We have a great working relationship with our federal law enforcement partners and will continue to assist each of them.”
Berrien County Undersheriff Greg Sanders suggested local immigration enforcement within the confines of the jail is preferable, “as opposed to having agents come to town and try to locate individuals out in the community.”
But in Texas, where state legislators mandated that all sheriffs participate in the 287(g) program, federal agent presence has not decreased.
“We’ve seen the contrary,” said Osvaldo Grimaldi, a policy and advocacy strategist with the ACLU of Texas. “As we’ve seen an increase in 287(g) agreements with our county sheriffs, we’ve also seen an increase in federal immigration agents in areas where 287(g) agreements have been signed or are going to be signed.”
Grimaldi said many agencies are compelled to join under the task force model.
“When it comes to police departments and other agencies that don’t run their own jail, that’s the only model that’s available to them,” he said.
Guidance to law enforcement agencies from the Michigan ACLU, updated in September 2025, observes that “[w]hen noncitizens perceive that local law enforcement agencies are helping to enforce federal immigration law, rather than prioritizing public safety in their communities, they may be less likely to reach out to police or sheriff’s departments when they are witnesses to or victims of a crime, because they fear that they or their loved ones might end up detained and deported.”
The guidance document notes that the term noncitizen “includes individuals who are not (yet) U.S. citizens—such as those with temporary status, legal presence, or permanent residency.”
The latest information on the 287(g) program is available at www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g.

Recent failed attempts by Gov. Mike Braun and Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston to redistrict legislative boundaries via hyper-partisan gerrymandering are a testament to the exclusionist philosophy that only one party has the solutions to the complex demands and issues facing our diverse state.
Let me explain.
I was born in the industrial heartland of working Hoosiers whose father and mother were subject to horrific acts of discriminatory exclusion throughout their lives. Parents who, because of their lifelong experiences and education, would never entertain a thought of voting for “racist Democrats” that dominated the national segregationist political atmosphere of their Depression-born lives.
Being their youngest, who grew up in Fort Wayne, I was always reared to observe and analyze political developments from a lens of true empowerment which placed emphasis on truth which no one party could honestly claim exclusivity.
I graduated from quality private and public schooling which later enabled me to go to Indiana University in Bloomington with dual degrees in Political Science and Telecommunications.
In 1986, Gov. Robert D. Orr selected me among 150+ applicants to participate in a graduate fellowship program to serve Hoosiers
I was blessed to serve in this capacity at various state agencies including the Indiana State Police. I had the honor of ,eeting Jim Sears — the first Black male Indiana State Police Trooper to pass his class in 1964.
I mention these facts not to brag but to bring perspective to my own political viewpoints, which are politically Independent.
Civil rights win
Immediately after leaving the Office of the Indiana Governor, I was hired as a management level employee of the Indiana Civil Rights Commission, where I was tasked with shepherding the legislative agenda of this agency.
In 1988, the federal government passed the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 which mandated that ALL states and localities receiving federal funds for Civil Rights Enforcement Activities amend their state statutes to add legal protections for persons with disabilities and familial status from discrimination in housing.
Indiana, a state notorious for its lack of civil rights protections, stood to lose much but was saved by the bipartisan leadership and sponsorship efforts of two key Indiana Republicans — Sens. William “Bill” Soards and Richard Bray, of Indianapolis and Martinsville, respectively.
At that time, Republican officials acknowledged that they represented all Indiana citizens regardless of who chose, endorsed, supported and ultimately elected them to office.
Lacking
My, how times have changed.
Today’s political leaders claim to represent the interests of all Hoosiers but only if they vote Republican.
As WTHR recently reported, Republican Sen. Mike Young wants to give the Indiana State Police responsibility for policing downtown Indianapolis as well as providing for a special prosecutor appointed by the governor. This would usurp and undermine the powers and electoral accountability of both the current elected Democratic Mayor and County Prosecutor effective December31, 2026.
In 2024, Trump received 58.6% of the vote in Indiana compared to 39.6% for Harris. Leaders shouldn’t ignore the 1.1 million Hoosiers that voted for different policies and priorities.
How is enshrining political and racial division into Indiana law considered to be either fair or reasonable? When our so-called leaders justify horrendous public policy actions that exclude entire groups of voters from having their ballots counted we have reached a new low in Indiana.
Disregarding the political will of Indiana voters is neither democratic or wise, and illustrates why our state’s elected political leadership is held in such profound disregard.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Indiana-Capitol-2-GettyImages-1089342774-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

As physicians and Missourians, we remain grounded in our work based on what we see in exam rooms every day: people making deeply personal decisions, supported by evidence-based care. Even with a constitutional right in effect for more than a year, restoring care while navigating the lingering impacts of political interference remains ongoing and challenges our ability to provide care our patients are entitled to.
On the eve of a two-week trial in Jackson County — the most significant legal moment yet to realize that right — we are reminded that the health, dignity and well-being of people receiving care must remain at the center of this work.
That constitutional amendment, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, was approved by Missourians just over a year ago. That vote affirmed a simple principle that guides good medicine: health care decisions belong to patients, made in consultation with their trusted providers.
Within just months of that vote, Planned Parenthood resumed abortion care in Missouri. From Columbia to Kansas City to St. Louis, we’ve welcomed and treated patients who are relieved to receive procedural abortion care closer to home.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has confirmed that abortion care is being provided in hospitals. After years of laws and restrictions hollowing out Missouri’s reproductive health care system by limiting how, when and whether providers could care for patients, we can once again find hope as we rebuild safe, local abortion access in Missouri.
Abortion care takes many forms, and all options must be available to ensure providers can offer the full range of options based on a patient’s medical needs and circumstances.
Procedural abortion, which is currently available in Missouri, is a medically necessary and appropriate option for many patients. So is medication abortion. This form of care uses the same safe and effective medications prescribed for miscarriage care and accounts for the majority of abortions nationwide, which is why we are challenging the ban on its use.
Building meaningful abortion access for patients across the state will not be possible without this essential care.
When government policies restrict or stigmatize specific forms of care, they interfere with the doctor–patient relationship. Interference creates delays, confusion, and fear, all of which can worsen health outcomes. Additionally, when patients fear scrutiny or exposure around their health care decisions, they may avoid care altogether.
That risk extends beyond abortion to miscarriage management, prenatal care, and routine reproductive health services.
These concerns are especially acute in Missouri, where more than 55 counties already lack OB/GYN providers. Patients in rural and low-income communities often travel long distances for care, taking time off work, arranging childcare, and absorbing additional costs. Political interference in reproductive health care compounds these barriers and deepens existing inequities for already vulnerable patients and their families.
Reproductive freedom is not theoretical. It is lived every day in exam rooms, where patients make decisions about their own bodies, and clinicians provide care guided by professional standards of care, ethics, and trust.
These patients are our neighbors, our friends, our family—Missourians whose lives, health, and dignity are shaped by whether they can access care when they need it.
The legal process that has unfolded since Missourians demanded their right to reproductive freedom has been technical and deliberative, and the upcoming trial will be no different. As physicians who provide this care, our obligation, both in the clinic and the courtroom, is clear: we center our patients, always.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_5136-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, the GOP’s frontrunner for governor, has accomplished something truly remarkable: He managed to commit multiple ethical violations, be publicly admonished by the Montana Supreme Court in a unanimous decision, and then announce—without irony—that he won.
That’s talent.
The Montana Commission on Practice unanimously concluded Knudsen engaged in “unprecedented misconduct” and recommended suspending his law license for 90 days based on 41 alleged violations. The Supreme Court did not agree with the Commission on every alleged violation, but it did unanimously conclude Knudsen violated the ethical rules governing attorneys. It then issued a 149-page public admonition—an extraordinarily rare judicial equivalent of a megaphone—and dismissed the case, bringing the matter to a close.
Knudsen’s core defense throughout the case was that the ethical rules simply didn’t apply to him. This is roughly equivalent to insisting gravity is optional if you really believe in yourself.
The court disagreed. Firmly. Unanimously. 
In clear, unmistakable language, it concluded Knudsen violated multiple rules governing all attorneys. Among other findings, the court held Knudsen violated Rule 3.4(c) by disobeying a direct court order for months and violated Rule 5.1(c) by allowing his subordinates to do the same. The Attorney General of Montana ignored the Montana Supreme Court and let his staff help.
The court also noted Knudsen used “extraordinarily inflammatory language” toward the Court and individual justices, accused the court of personal conflicts, and repeatedly claimed he did not have to follow court orders he believed were issued “improperly.” That argument generally works about as well as telling a police officer you don’t recognize the concept of speed limits.
After all that, Knudsen declared victory.
It’s like celebrating the sinking of the Titanic because the band sounded great.
Yes, the court declined to impose the professional “death penalty” of suspending Knudsen’s law license—a punishment that would have removed him from office under Montana’s Constitution. That decision was proportional and appropriate under the circumstances. Public censure is not leniency; it is a serious sanction reserved for serious misconduct. It reflects both accountability and restraint—recognizing that discipline should correct behavior, not merely end careers. Calling this outcome a “win” misses the point entirely.
Which brings us to Knudsen’s response. Instead of acknowledging the ruling, expressing regret, or committing to change, his office dismissed the case as a “frivolous complaint” and a “political stunt.” Translation:  I did nothing wrong.
That response matters. Knudsen is not just another lawyer. He is Montana’s top prosecutor, supervises more attorneys than anyone else in the state, and sets the tone for ethical conduct in Montana’s legal system. His example tells every lawyer under him—and every Montanan watching—that accountability is optional if you complain loudly enough.
Only time will tell whether the Supreme Court’s public admonition was adequate to address Knudsen’s ethical failings and to deter similar conduct in the future. Based on his response to the court’s ruling, it may not have been. The court exercised restraint and extended grace—carefully, deliberately and in full view of the public. Knudsen responded not with reflection or humility, but with defiance and attack. Grace was met with grievance. Accountability was met with contempt. That is not just stupid; it is stupid with gusto.
There’s a cynical part of me that suspects Knudsen will wear this public admonition as a campaign badge of honor, proof that he “fought the system.” I hope I’m wrong. Montana deserves leaders who understand that ethics are not partisan, court orders are not suggestions, and losing a case does not magically become winning by press release.
The lesson here is simple: Ethics still matter in Montana—even when inconvenient, even when ignored, even when mocked. The Supreme Court said so. Loudly.

Hoy said that the Falcon Report focused on behavioral health, correctional practices, health care, employee wellness, leadership development, agency culture, recruitment of staff and problems in the restrictive housing unit, otherwise known as solitary confinement. The review lasted nearly a year, and highlighted a number of positive changes within DOC that Hoy listed, including: 

Developing an objective custody classification system in 2023;
Restructuring the Bureau of Health Services in 2024,
Expanding the earned release program,
Transitioning the Waupun Correctional Institution to having all single cells,
Reforming restrictive housing in 2024 by enhancing training and increasing security rounds, 
Implementing new systems to track the number and frequency of security rounds, 
Retraining medication distribution and documentation, 
Performing security audits,
Requiring supervisory meetings at Waupun at the beginning of each shift,
Implementing a new restrictive housing policy. 

It wasn’t an entirely rosy picture, however. “As noted in the report, our agency is at a period of transition,” said Hoy. “We are not alone in navigating this unique point in time following the operational disruptions of the pandemic and the related staffing shortages that followed.” 
Hoy urged people to view the report in that context as he went into the areas of improvement it suggested. High vacancy rates for staff at different institutions remains an issue, although the DOC has been able to fill more security positions due to pay raises approved by the state Legislature. This has created a “new and unique concern,” Hoy said, in that many staff are new and do not have much correctional experience. Additionally, many staff members were hired during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus have skewed perceptions of what normal DOC procedures look like. The highly restrictive, atypical protocols intended to stifle the spread of COVID-19 became the formative experience of this new generation of DOC guards and staff. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Mental health needs among DOC residents was another area of concern. Hoy noted that “44% of male persons in our care and 91% of female persons in our care have a mental health condition.” As a result of the study, DOC is working towards updating its mental health classification system, creating specific mental health units, better monitoring and collecting mental health data, and improving conditions within the restrictive housing unit, otherwise known as solitary confinement, and increasing programming and recreation. 
“So while the results of this study are both informative and valuable, they represent only the starting point,” said Hoy. “The true measure of our agency’s success will be determined by how thoughtfully and effectively we act upon the recommendations that follow.” DOC is currently planning another contract with Falcon to develop a framework to review the report’s key findings, and implement its recommendations. Although many of the changes will need to cover the entire DOC, Hoy said the state agency will also look at specific institutions to “reimagine” their functions, and begin implementing changes at five “pilot sites” before expanding to other facilities. 
Hoy took questions from corrections committee members. Public comment in response to the secretary’s presentation was not allowed. Lawmakers pointed out that the DOC remains overcrowded, with over 23,000 people spread across various prisons. Some highlighted the need for more uniformity among DOC policies across facilities, as well as a need for increased and centralized data analysis. 
Hoy acknowledged that there are ongoing problems with placing people in appropriate facilities, such as people who should be in minimum or medium-security prisons being placed in maximum security institutions, or people with severe mental health needs not being cared for adequately. He also noted that because DOC is generally a paramilitary organization, staff are often “craving” direction and vision from their leadership. Hoy said that there is more work to be done to change the culture among DOC staff, emphasizing that “we need to treat everybody with dignity and respect, to treat people as human beings, and see that person no matter whether they have a cap and gown and they’re graduating and ready to walk out the door, or if they’re sitting at rock bottom in restrictive housing, that they are still a human being.”
Hygiene and feminine product access in prison
The Corrections Committee also heard testimony on three bills which were open to public comment. One Republican bill (AB 297) would provide pay bonuses to DOC probation and parole officers based on their ability to increase employment rates among their clients under supervision. Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R – De Pere), the bill’s author and a member of the corrections committee, said the bill would help reduce the recidivism rate. Franklin was questioned by fellow lawmakers about whether the bill would adversely affect people who have small children at home, or who need to prioritize substance abuse treatment and mental health care over finding immediate employment. 
There were also questions about how probation and parole officers might abuse the incentive structure such as by creating revolving doors where clients get and lose jobs, only to be hired somewhere else, earning another bonus for their probation agent. 
The bill was backed by Cicero Action, a policy advocacy group whose board of directors is chaired by Joe Lonsdale, a billionaire co-founder of the data and surveillance company Palentir. Lonsdale has called for the use of public hangings to demonstrate “masculine leadership.”
Members of the public who attended the hearing, including members of the criminal justice reform advocacy groups Dream.org, Ladies of SCI, Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, and others testified that people on probation and parole already have lives dictated by the whims of their agents. One woman gave an example of a formerly incarcerated loved one who had to take time out of their day for a three hour bus ride to check in with a probation agent for just a few minutes. Others shared firsthand experiences of being placed in unfulfilling jobs for which they were ill suited by their probation agents, or being discouraged from applying for certain kinds of work.

Two Democratic bills (AB 736 and AB 741) focused on increasing hygiene products across DOC facilities and expanding access to menstrual products for incarcerated women. Reps. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison), Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) and Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) presented the bills to the committee. 
Stubbs said that “good hygiene is both a matter of health and dignity, especially for those incarcerated.” AB 741 would require the DOC to provide culturally sensitive products ranging from shampoos to shaving cream, bar soap, natural conditioners, and other products through the commissary at no more than 125% of the price at the highest-grossing retail chain in Wisconsin, or no more than 100% of the sales price, depending on the product. Incarcerated people would also be given a $25 monthly stipend to help purchase hygiene products. The bill would also require sheriffs overseeing jails to provide a stipend and products to people held within jails. 
During testimony, some formerly incarcerated people  shared experiences of witnessing fellow incarcerated people fight because of bad hygiene. Family members of incarcerated people said that the costs to purchase commissary items, make phone calls and other expenses amount to unsustainable drains on their household budgets.

AB 736 would expand access to safe and appropriate menstrual products to incarcerated women. Although some prisons and jails take it upon themselves to provide such products to their residents, not all of them do so consistently nor do they provide a range of appropriate products. In some cases, women can bleed through their clothing in prisons and jails, creating embarrassing and awkward situations in which correctional staff may or may not be sympathetic to their needs. 
“In this way, menstruation becomes a monthly cycle of humiliation solely borne by women simply because they are women,” said Johnson. “And that’s not fair.” Johnson called providing menstrual products to incarcerated women “a minimum standard of care in more than two dozen states,” adding that the federal prison system guarantees women access to tampons and pads in correctional facilities. “States that have implemented these policies report minimal cost and improved conditions including fewer medical complications, fewer grievances, and safer, more sanitized facility environments.”
Lawmakers, as well as members of the public, pushed the committee to consider providing menstruation cups as well as more common products like tampons, and to evaluate whether products are safe or if they come with a risk of exposing incarcerated women to toxins. Many in the committee pointed out that if public bathrooms — including those in the Capitol — provide women with menstrual products for free, then why can’t jails and prisons? 
“For far too long meaningful conversations about menstruation have been avoided due to stigma, and it is my hope that as leaders in the state of Wisconsin, we can change that,” Vining said in a statement. “We need to talk about this issue now because women are one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S. And over the last 25 years, the number of women in Wisconsin’s prisons and jails has quadrupled. Our state jails and prisons, and their policies and programs, were simply not designed to safely and humanely incarcerate women.”

(Photo by GracedBytheLight/Getty Images)Rather than taking steps to reign in the clout of the growing poultry industry and protect the public, Oklahoma lawmakers have chosen to further deregulate and shield it from legal attacks.
This has given Big Agriculture and its corporate lobbyists license to despoil our natural resources, wreak havoc on our region’s waterways and exploit our state farmers.
The inflection point was reached in 2005 when then-Attorney General Drew Edmonson sued several large agricultural producers, including Tyson, Cargill, and Simmons Foods, that commonly contract with Oklahoma’s poultry farms. The lawsuit sought to hold these major poultry companies accountable for polluting the Illinois River Watershed with phosphorus from spreading chicken waste.
A trial was held in 2009, but it took 14 more years before U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled for the state, finding the companies financially responsible for decades of pollution, ordering them to fund cleanup efforts, and imposing strict limits on poultry waste application to prevent further damage.
Despite no farmers being named as defendants in the case, the response from supporters of the poultry companies has been to redirect blame and portray the litigation as an attack on agriculture.
The issue has put Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Attorney General Gentner Drummond at odds. Drummond  continued to pursue the lawsuit while serving as state attorney general in order to ensure the companies were held liable. Stitt has sided with the poultry industry, recently meeting with producers in Adair County and saying the suit is only lining the pockets of the trial attorneys.
Tyson Foods, for their part, stated that if a sensible solution is not reached, it would be compelled to phase out its contracts with producers in the watershed. AG Drummond has called Tyson’s threats “gamesmanship” and part of a coordinated misinformation campaign by Tyson Foods to intimidate Oklahomans and deflect accountability. He said reports show Tyson is seeking to increase its production capacity in the watershed which contradicts claims that it has been forced to scale back operations due to the lawsuit.
What were the factors that helped to create and maintain this clash between corporate interests and the safeguarding of our environment that has transformed life for rural residents?
As many as 99.5% of U.S. chickens are raised by contract farmers for major processors, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture.
A few large companies like Tyson control the majority of the market, giving them immense leverage over farmers.
Farmers invest heavily in barns and equipment but receive payment based on short-term contracts, often in what’s known as a “tournament system” that pits them against each other for bonuses.
The system traps farmers in debt and limits their ability to find other buyers, especially as large processors control the processing plants.
In essence, while farmers own the land and buildings, the large corporations own the birds, feed, and market, creating a heavily controlled environment where most farmers are dependent on Big Ag.
Yet this begs the question of why these operators are often granted protections to escape responsibility for the damages they cause.
The answer is that Oklahoma’s regulatory environment, shaped by powerful agricultural interests, has prioritized and shielded large-scale poultry production.
The 2024 Oklahoma Legislature created a new law, Senate Bill 1424, that forbids property owners in the Illinois River Watershed whose lands and surface waterways have been polluted by runoff from poultry litter from pursuing legal action against contracted poultry growers unless an enforcement action has been taken by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry.
The law also provides legal immunity to poultry corporations.
Additionally, there are regulatory loopholes that have eased the path for large-scale operations.
Oklahoma allows many large industrial chicken farms to register as Poultry Feeding Operations rather than the more strictly regulated Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations. Poultry Feeding Operations have less restrictive setback requirements and do not require the same public notice to neighbors before construction.
Successful lobbying by the poultry industry in the 1990s also led to a loophole where a permit isn’t required if a property owner claims the water is for “domestic use” rather than for commercial purposes. As reported in the Arkansas Advocate, water usage is essentially unlimited. The state Water Resources Board relies on an honor system for water reporting, and the agency has never revoked a permit or penalized anyone for exceeding their allowed water usage.
HB 2053, which was passed in 2023, limits opposition to industrial water permits. The legislation’s clear intent, to which even the bill’s author, Republican state Sen. Brent Howard admitted, was to make it harder for people to oppose large poultry operations.
And in 2024, Stitt vetoed a HB 3194 that would have required metering devices on all groundwater wells across the state — a move praised by the agriculture industry and the Oklahoma Farm Bureau.
As lawmakers prepare to convene for the upcoming session next month, they will undoubtedly face continuing pressure to acquiesce to Big Ag interests.
I hope they will bear in mind that it’s possible for the poultry industry and clean water to coexist.
But as AG Drummond cautioned “what we cannot accept is allowing massive corporations to pollute our waterways without consequence.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Two constitutional amendment proposals that could be on Wisconsinites’ ballots in November received public hearings on Tuesday, including one to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs from state and local governments and one to bar the governor from issuing partial vetoes that increase taxes. 
Constitutional amendment proposals in Wisconsin must pass the state Legislature in two consecutive sessions and receive majority approval from voters to become law. Each proposal is on its second consideration, meaning if they pass the Senate and Assembly, each would appear on voters’ ballots in November alongside a slate of consequential races including for governor, Congress and the state Legislature.
One of the proposed constitutional amendments, SJR 94, takes aim at DEI programs throughout state and local government in Wisconsin. Republicans have been targeting DEI programs for years and have at times found success, including when they elicited concessions from the University of Wisconsin system in 2023. 
If the proposal passed the Senate and Assembly, voters will see on their ballots the question “Shall section 27 of article I of the constitution be created to prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration?”
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) told the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee that the proposal would “ensure that we hire, promote, select, and admit people to our unit, public universities, schools and government agencies the same way we choose people for our Olympic team, military and sports teams — through merit, character, ability and hard work without regard to race, sex color, ethnicity or other immutable characteristics.” 
Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) asked the authors of the proposal how they define “preferential treatment” and whether they know about the types of programs the amendment would eliminate.
“I don’t know how deep it is in hiring, contracting… I would say if the criteria for making your choice deals with race or sex, then that’s not appropriate,” Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville) said.
Drake brought up the state’s Supplier Diversity Program, which was established in the 1980s and certifies minority-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned and woman-owned businesses to provide better opportunities for them to do business with the state of Wisconsin. 
“Everyone should have access to opportunity. The reality is that our state historically has not shown that. That [program] was created because we have minority-owned businesses that were seeking opportunities for state contracting and they weren’t getting them, and that was based on relationships, it was based on race… and so this was implemented as a protective measure to ensure that people weren’t being discriminated against,” Drake said. “We’re pushing this forward when we still haven’t addressed what’s happening. If we’re doing this based on merit, then I would argue that there’s plenty of different minority-owned businesses that would be more than qualified, but they don’t get them, and you have to ask why.”
“They may be qualified, but are they the most qualified?” asked Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield). “And what this does is it takes away… the sex, the gender all of those items that the U.S. Constitution lays out as this is something that you can’t discriminate against. If you discriminate against a male because he’s a male, that’s still discrimination.” 
Dan Lennington, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty’s managing vice president and deputy counsel, said the bill would help to ensure that Wisconsin is “color blind.”
Lennington leads the conservative legal organization “Equality Under the Law Program,” and spoke to the number of lawsuits they’ve engaged in on the issue.
“We sued [former President] Joe Biden 12 times. We have five lawsuits pending against President [Donald] Trump right now based on race discrimination. We have a lot of things in the pipeline against the state of Wisconsin… We’d love to sue over the Minority Supplier Program. We haven’t gotten to it yet” Lennington said. “A constitutional amendment would, especially a new attorney general, would wipe all this clean and enforce the law as it’s already written, and would really help bring this to an abrupt end. Otherwise, there’s going to be decades more of this litigation.” 
Colbey Decker, a WILL client who alleges her white son who struggles with dyslexia faced racial discrimination in the Green Bay Area School District, testified in favor of the proposed amendment. The Trump administration launched an investigation into the school district over the allegations last year. 
Decker told the committee that her son wasn’t able to receive reading services because he is white, saying that she found that the school’s “success plan” included a policy related to “prioritizing resources to First Nations, Black and Hispanic students.”
“When an educational system’s moral compass is calibrated by a child’s skin color, the system has fundamentally failed. Our family’s story has forever changed after witnessing firsthand the casual callousness of sorting my son, color-coding him and then deprioritizing him based on his race,” Decker said. “The brutal reality of DEI is that it robs all children of the dignity and respect of individuality.” 
Curtailing executive partial veto power
SJR 116 would limit the governor’s partial veto power by prohibiting any vetoes from “creating or increasing or authorizing the creation or increase of any tax or fee.”
Lawmakers introduced the proposal last session in response to Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto on the last state budget that extended school revenue increases for an additional 400 years. He did so by striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425. The action was upheld by the state Supreme Court in April 2025. 
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said the school revenue increases that are resulting from the partial veto are “unaffordable” and “unsustainable” for Wisconsinites.
“No governor, Republican or Democrat, should be able to single-handedly raise taxes on Wisconsin families with the stroke of his pen. The governor is not a king,” Nedweski said. “This constitutional amendment reigns in that power, restores the proper balance between the branches of government and ensures taxpayers are protected from runaway tax increases in the future.”
A recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report found that Wisconsin property taxpayers’ December bills included the highest increase since 2018 and warned property taxpayers could see similar increases to their property taxes in the future.
“We did all get a kick in the pants with property taxes this year… we’re gonna get another wack in 2026 in December,” Nass said during the hearing. 
Drake said the bill appeared to be a “grab for power.” 
Kapenga, one of the proposal authors, pushed back on the comment, saying if he were governor, he would sign a bill from Drake eliminating the governor’s ability to levy such a veto. 
“I do not like the power that the governor has in this state, regardless of who it is,” Kapenga said. “The power of the people should be vested in the Legislature, not in the executive branch.”
The question voters would see is: “Shall section 10 (1) (c) of article V of the constitution be amended to prohibit the governor, in exercising his or her partial veto authority, from creating or increasing or authorizing the creation or increase of any tax or fee?”
Constitutional amendments have been used to limit the partial veto power in a couple other scenarios, including in 1990 when voters approved the prohibition of the “Vanna White” veto, or eliminating single letters within words, and in 2008, when voters approved, eliminating the “Frankenstein veto” — or the ability for governors to create new sentences by combining parts of two or more sentences.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The bruising Statehouse fight over Indiana congressional redistricting is looming over the formal start of the legislative campaign season.
Indiana’s month-long candidate filing period opened Wednesday — with Republican senators who opposed redrawing the maps braced for primary challengers and Democrats believing the issue will boost their chances to break the GOP’s supermajority hold on the Legislature.
The first-day filers included Sen. Travis Holdman, one of the top Republican Senate leaders and among those who voted against the redistricting bill demanded by President Donald Trump.
Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and Trump-aligned groups have vowed to support Republican primary challengers to lawmakers who weren’t on board.
Holdman, R-Markle, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he knew pro-redistricting groups were “looking for somebody” to oppose his bid for a fifth term.
When asked whether the eight Republican senators who opposed redistricting and are poised to seek reelection this year were taking the primary threats seriously, Holdman simply replied: “Oh, yeah.”
Democrats see political hope
Democrats expressed enthusiasm for their chances this election cycle, with about two dozen joining in a mass-filing effort at the Statehouse for legislative seats organized by the Indiana Rural Summit Coalition.
Michelle Higgs, the coalition founder and a Democrat who is seeking the seat now held by Republican Rep. Peggy Mayfield of Martinsville, said the candidates would share technology and research in order to help their campaigns.
“We showed up at the Statehouse to lend our voices that redistricting was a power grab to remove power from the people,” Higgs said. “It will be part of every candidate’s campaign to bring power back to the people.”
A top goal of Democrats in 2026 is to pick up the four Indiana House seats they need to break the Republican two-thirds supermajority that allows them to take action even without Democrats being present.
Republicans now hold a 70-30 House majority and have had supermajority control since the 2012 elections. The GOP has a 40-10 hold on the Senate, where its supermajority has been in place since the 2010 elections.
Democratic House Caucus Chair Carey Hamilton said candidate recruitment hasn’t been as difficult as it was in past election cycles — and that the redistricting fight helped her party.
“It made people more aware of what’s going on at the Statehouse, and even more people kind of coming out of the woodwork wanting to be involved,” Hamilton said. “I think there are some folks who maybe were considering running, where it really kind of sealed the deal.”

While Democrats are looking to have serious candidates in more legislative races around the state, the focus starts on about a half-dozen districts that had tight outcomes in the 2024 elections.
One of those is the Bloomington-area district where Democrat Amy Oliver, an attorney and Brown County School Board member, is looking to challenge Republican Rep. Dave Hall after he won with 51% of the vote in 2024.
Oliver said Wednesday she believed the supermajority control has led to the public being locked out of the Legislature’s decision making.
“One-party rule is not good for anybody, I think, in either direction,” Oliver said. “We want to flip all those districts because it’s really important that they debate in public.”
Republican Senate primaries expected
The first day of candidate filings saw redistricting opponent Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, reverse his previous decision to retire from the Legislature and enter the race for a fifth term.
Walker will face at least one Republican primary challenger in Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, who supported the redistricting bill.
Redistricting could also be a key issue in the reelection bid of Republican Sen. Jim Buck of Kokomo, who filed for a fifth term after voting against the proposed new map. Tipton County Commissioner Tracey Powell filed to challenge Buck.
Republican former Sen. John Ruckelshaus, meanwhile, is seeking a Statehouse return by filing for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis. Ruckelshaus previously served an adjoining district during 2017-21.

That could become an open seat as Ford told the Capital Chronicle he was considering a run for the 5th Congressional District seat now held by Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz.
Republican Sen. Greg Goode of Terre Haute, who voted against redistricting and plans to seek reelection this year, expressed hope that the map debate will fade away.
“I’m optimistic, from the standpoint of this is now ’26 and we’ve got a lot of work that we ought to be focused on during this legislative session,” Goode said in an interview. “I personally want to move forward.”
Goode was among the legislators to face intimidation threats over redistricting, with a swatting call that brought police to his home hours after Trump called him out by name as a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” in a social media post.
Goode said he wasn’t thinking about who might run against him in the May primary.
“It’s a free country,” he said. “Everybody should have the opportunity to run.”

Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) told the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee that ensuring that the cost of services provided would help with health care affordability.  
“When hospitals clearly share pricing information, patients can make informed decisions. Trust in the system grows and costs come down naturally,” Bradley said, adding that the bill would ensure Wisconsin “reaps the benefits” of changes made by the Trump administration. 
During his first term, President Donald Trump’s administration implemented rules to require hospitals to post pricing information online. The effects of the changes on patients’ costs have been mixed. At the start of his second term, Trump signed an executive order intended to bolster the effort and in December, the administration proposed a new rule that aims to simplify how price data is organized and shared with people. 
SB 383 would instruct the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to enforce federal price transparency requirements for hospitals. 
Bradley and Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia), the bill coauthors, said it is needed to help ensure that federal policies are being followed.
“Sometimes we need to take action to make sure that it goes all the way through the state and all of our residents have access to the things that are expected through federal law,” Wittke said. 
Bradley said the lawmakers aren’t trying to penalize hospitals, just ensure people have access to information. 
If a hospital is found to be out of compliance under the bill, Wisconsin DHS would be able to take several actions including providing a written notice to the hospital, requesting a corrective action plan or imposing a financial penalty. DHS would also need to keep a public list of any hospitals that have violated the requirements.
Hospitals would also need to be certified as being in compliance with the requirements when seeking judgment from a court against a patient who owes a debt for services.
Lawmakers introduced a similar bill in 2023, but it failed to receive a floor vote in the Senate and advance in the Assembly.
The current version of the bill includes a provision that says that if federal laws change and are eliminated, then provisions in the bill that establish state level requirements for publishing prices will take effect.
Under those provisions, each hospital would need to make a list of “shoppable services” — ones that can be scheduled in advance such as a knee replacement — available with the standard charge for each item that would be publicly available. A hospital’s list would need to include at least 300 “shoppable services,” and if a hospital doesn’t provide that many, it must list all of its shoppable services.
The change is meant to avoid overlapping and varying requirements, though hospital representatives expressed concerns that would happen anyway.
The Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) opposes the bill. Christian Moran, the WHA vice president of Medicaid and payer reimbursement policy, said during the hearing that the organization’s opposition to the bill is not opposition to price transparency.
“Our opposition is to the added regulatory complexity that is created by layering on state level enforcement and state level regulations and unlimited fines on Wisconsin hospitals when robust federal regulation and enforcement already exists,” Moran said.
Moran said no Wisconsin hospitals have been fined for noncompliance since the first federal regulations went into effect. 
“Personal experience, it’s somewhat inevitable: if you pass legislation on the state level that mirrors the federal level it will eventually not match up,” John Russell, president and CEO of Prairie Ridge Health, said. 
Hospital representatives also expressed concerns that not enough attention was being given to the role of health insurance companies. 
“The solution proposed to you in [SB] 383 is to double up on existing enforcement for hospitals while ignoring the state’s current responsibility to enforce and monitor insurance compliance,” Moran said.
Brian Stephens, CEO of the Door County Medical Center, said the state should be more focused on the “middlemen” including insurance providers, saying that bolstering the transparency of hospital costs has its limitations. He spoke to the work that his medical center has done over many years to improve transparency of prices.
“There’s a disconnect in this country between the concerted efforts of health care providers to provide reasonable and transparent prices and the costs that people are paying for health insurance. Unfortunately, hospital price transparency efforts have not put a dent in that dichotomy,” Stephens said. “Perhaps we need to be asking for more transparency from health insurance companies and other middlemen to understand the real drivers of health care costs in our country. Perhaps hospitals have just become a good punching bag for folks who need an effective sound bite. The reality is that, despite our wholehearted commitment to providing reasonable upfront prices, transparency has its limitations. What are the odds that a person waking up with pain will take the time to bring out his or her phone and search the most affordable hospital or clinic prior to seeking treatment.”
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) said the testimony focused on the insurance companies’ role sounded like “a lot of finger-pointing.” 
Several other states have adopted laws or are in the process of advancing bills to bolster price transparency including Colorado, Washington State and Ohio. 
Patrick Neville, a former Republican state representative in Colorado who helped pass a similar law in his state, testified on the Wisconsin bill, saying provisions in his home state have already helped. He told the story of one patient who was charged nearly $80,000 for a hysterectomy, but didn’t have to pay the cost.
“Because we had the consumer protections in this bill in Colorado, and they weren’t compliant with price transparency. They couldn’t actually collect that $80,000,” Neville said. “That was really important and powerful for the actual consumer in this case, and so it’s actually working in Colorado.” 
Neville added that the Colorado legislation did not codify the federal rules, but he wishes it had. 
“Any president could get rid of those rules at any point and I think the way this bill is crafted… It’s hugely important,” Neville said. “That’s a clever way to craft it.” 
Several employers testified in favor of the legislation. 
Erik Sonju, president of Fitchburg-based Power System Engineering, described the unpredictable jumps in health care costs that his company has grappled with since 2018 when he started in his position. He said that 2023 was the year the “straw broke” as they dealt with a 20% increase in insurance rates and he wasn’t able to get clear answers about the rising cost. 
Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) told the committee that the cost of health care is too high. 
“This is common sense. What major purchase does anyone in this room make without knowing the cost before you make the purchase? It is inconceivable to me that we do not know what something is going to cost of that magnitude before we actually consent to the cost,” Felzkowski said.  
Felzkowski is the lead coauthor on two of the other bills the committee took up. SB 796 would require insurers to submit information about claims to the Wisconsin Health Information Organization (WHIO), a nonprofit organization that collects health care claims data, and SB 797 would provide a $600,000 grant for the WHIO to establish an online dashboard of health care claims information and to add new payer data.
The committee also took testimony on SB 703, coauthored by Wittke and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), which would establish that employers who sponsor group health insurance plans have a right to data relating to the employees and dependents covered under those plans, including claims data, utilization reports and other information necessary to understand and manage health care costs.
Wittke said the bill will maintain privacy protections by requiring employers to designate a HIPAA compliance privacy officer and ensure that the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance maintains oversight. The bill also includes a provision prohibiting data from being sold to any party without the permission of the plan sponsor and the person to whom the claims data relates.

Prism Logistics' state leases are not subject to county regulations, judge rules, and the company's request for lease extensions is remanded back to the state.
The post Judge sides with developer of controversial Casper Mountain gravel pit appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a controversial gravel mining operation at the base of Casper Mountain has won two major legal challenges and says he is ready to begin mining as soon as possible.
Wyoming 7th District Court Judge Joshua C. Eames ruled Tuesday that Prism Logistics’ state land leases are not subject to county land use regulations, including a recent zoning change that would have blocked the industrial operation proposed next to a rural neighborhood on the west side of Casper. 
The judge also remanded back to the state Prism’s request to extend some of its leases, which the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners had denied last year.
Eames issued two separate rulings: one regarding the state’s denial of Prism’s lease extensions, and one regarding Natrona County’s authority over leasing actions on state lands.

The rulings follow nearly two years of intense opposition and legal wrangling over a proposed gravel mining operation that nearby homeowners, as well as residents throughout Natrona County, rallied against as harming a popular recreation area and threatening public health and safety. Opponents, including the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, convinced the county to rezone the area to prevent the operation — an action that helped convince some state land commissioners to deny Prism’s lease extension requests.
“Prism is very pleased with the rulings,” Prism Manager Kyle True told WyoFile on Wednesday, adding, “gravel operations are not inconsistent with a high quality of life, multiple use of Wyoming’s resources, including hiking and uses for education.”
Opponents, particularly the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, argued that mining operations might plague neighboring homes with dust, noise and heavy truck traffic. They also worry about how mining might impact shallow aquifers that residents rely on for water.


What are state trust lands?
Upon granting statehood in 1890, the federal government bestowed some 4.2 million acres of “state trust lands” to Wyoming, and it now manages about 3.4 million acres of trust land. The Wyoming Constitution prescribes that the primary use of those lands, which are scattered throughout the state in a checkerboard pattern, is to generate revenue to support public schools.
The Office of State Lands and Investments commonly leases those lands — often referred to as “school sections” — for grazing and industrial development such as mining and oil and gas drilling.


Complicating the issue is the fact that Prism is targeting a block of state trust lands, or “school sections,” that are prioritized to generate revenue for public schools and educational purposes. Often, that revenue-generation priority results in grazing and mining leases. Those state land priorities sometimes conflict with local uses and county health and safety rules.
The court’s ruling is disappointing, Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance cofounder Carolyn Griffith told WyoFile. “But I don’t think this is done,” she added, noting potential legal appeals and the fact that the State Board of Land Commissioners still has an opportunity to again deny Prism’s lease extension requests.
“Ultimately, I don’t know how it will go,” Griffith said, calling it “ludicrous” to allow a potential threat to a vital water resource. “The community is concerned because it’s the face of their mountain. It helps draw in some tourism to this community. It helps to retain some youth to the area because they use it for recreation.”

County zoning wasn’t the only issue at play in the state board’s denial of lease extensions. In June, Auditor Kristi Racines made the motion to reject Prism’s request to renew six of eight leases on the basis that Prism did not move forward on time with licensing and permits from the Department of Environmental Quality and Office of State Lands and Investments. 
If Prism ultimately prevails and is allowed to commence mining, True said, the company is prepared to begin mining immediately. If his hopes come to fruition, he said, opponents will find that “it will not have a significant, negative impact on anything.
“We struggle to see that the community will be harmed,” True added, “and we don’t think anything we’re doing is contrary to the public interest.” 
The State Board of Land Commissioners is composed of Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Racines.
Gray, who voted against renewing Prism’s state leases, issued a statement Wednesday condemning the court’s ruling as “outrageously wrong.” 
“This activist decision by an appointed judge needs to be appealed,” continued Gray, who recently announced his bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. “The State Board of Land Commissioners, elected by the people of Wyoming, made the correct decision to deny renewal of these leases in 2025. But now an activist judge is trying to force renewal of the leases, in direct contradiction with the Board’s decision.”
True took issue with Gray’s comments.
“I think this shows why Chuck Gray is generally unfit for statewide office,” True told WyoFile, “because he didn’t seem to read Judge Eames’ decision and respond to anything [in what is] quite a substantive decision. Instead, he stated his case with no new facts, but plenty of passion.”

The right to an abortion is protected by Wyoming's constitution, for now, but a constitutional amendment is on the horizon, warns guest columnist Britt Boril. 
The post The Wyoming Supreme Court made the correct decision on abortion appeared first on WyoFile .","On Tuesday, the Equality State lived up to its title.

Opinion

I shrieked when I read the opinion, teared up a bit and then my phone started blowing up. Texts, emails and notifications began rolling in from friends across the state and the country expressing unified joy. A simple truth we have long advocated for has been affirmed and spelled out in plain language by our Wyoming Supreme Court: Abortion is health care.
Now, I recognize that not everyone reacted with unbridled joy and relief. Abortion is an emotionally charged subject, one that, in an ideal world, would be approached with compassion, respect and recognition of the fact that pregnancy can sometimes be dangerous and filled with unforeseen complications. 
That is not how some of our elected officials chose to respond, with many instead lambasting the ruling and even attacking the justices themselves. Secretary of State Chuck Gray attempted to paint the justices as “leftwing activists” whose decision was “totally out of touch with the Wyoming Constitution.”
Might I suggest it is he who is totally out of touch?
In 2012, Wyoming voters passed an amendment to the state constitution — Article 1, Section 38 — which guarantees each competent adult “the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” Article 1 of the constitution establishes the core freedoms we all enjoy as Wyoming citizens. We, the people, chose to enshrine the right to make our own health care decisions as one of these core freedoms.
Although Justice Gray issued the sole dissenting opinion in the ruling, all five justices on the high court agreed that “the decision whether to terminate or continue a pregnancy is a health care decision under Article 1, Section 38.”
I am not an attorney or a constitutional scholar, and I will not attempt to provide a more detailed explanation as to why the abortion bans pushed by the state are unconstitutional. The justices provided a thorough and thoughtful 65-page explanation. 
I am a uterus-owning woman of birthing age who has found it incredibly difficult to attain basic reproductive health care in Wyoming.
I live in Casper, which has some of the “best” health care access in the state. Still, when I needed to seek routine care — not concerning pregnancy or abortion — the only provider I could find to see me in a reasonable timeframe was the Wellspring Health Access clinic. Wellspring is the only clinic in Wyoming to provide procedural abortions.
We are unbelievably fortunate to have Wellspring as a resource in our community. Almost half of our counties lack a practicing OB-GYN. The pause in labor and delivery services at Banner Platte County Hospital last fall marked the fourth labor and delivery ward closure since 2022 due to “physician recruitment challenges.”
As a vast state with a small population, we face obvious hurdles in recruiting medical talent. Uncertainty caused by abortion bans has hampered our ability to recruit even further. OB-GYNs do not want to practice in states where they face criminal penalties for providing the full standard of care, which includes abortion.
We have seen this horrifying reality play out in Idaho, which lost more than a third of its OB-GYNs between 2022 and 2024 after passing one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.
The Wyoming Legislature and the governor’s office are aware that our maternity care deserts present a major challenge to the state’s economy and standard of living. They’ve even identified maternal care as a policy priority. 
Yet, despite their purported interest in addressing the problem, their actions have repeatedly exacerbated our crisis. The Freedom Caucus consistently targets Wellspring for closure, a clinic that provides not just abortion care, but a full array of necessary reproductive care to our communities. 
How can we hope to attract and keep young families in the state if we cannot provide basic health services?
Instead of increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for obstetrics (a third of births in Wyoming are covered by Medicaid) in the 2025 interim sessions, members of the Joint Labor, Health & Social Services committee chose to advance legislation that shields fake clinics from oversight.
And now the governor has called on the Legislature to propose a constitutional amendment during this year’s time-constrained budget session to specifically carve out abortion from health care protections.
As abortion bans have rolled out across the US since 2022, we have seen pregnant women suffer and die, even in states with supposed “exceptions” in their bans. The reasons a woman may need to seek an abortion are endlessly varied and unique to her situation. But most of all, they are none of the government’s business. 
Wyomingites already voted to keep the government out of our health care decisions. If we must vote on another constitutional amendment, I have confidence that the people will again decide to protect our freedom to make the best decisions for ourselves.

If the judiciary can shift the meaning of major words, then constitutional government becomes less a balance of powers and more a rule by judicial interpretation, writes guest columnist Nathan Winters.
The post When a court redefines ‘health care’ to include abortion, it redefines self-government appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming received a hard lesson this week, not only about abortion, but about how the redefinition of a single word can quietly decide a moral debate and shift power away from voters.

Opinion

On Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that contended that “the decision to have an abortion is a health care decision.” That statement is anything but a routine legal conclusion. It is a choice about meaning, one with consequences far beyond this case.
In politics, people often try to win arguments by changing the meaning of words. If you can rename something, you can make it sound safer, kinder and less controversial.
But a label does not change reality. Calling abortion “health care” is not just describing a medical procedure. It is also making a moral claim: that abortion belongs in the same category as care that heals and protects patients.
So, the essential question becomes painfully simple: Is it honest to treat a procedure that intentionally ends an unborn human life as ordinary “health care,” simply because it occurs in a medical setting?
Most average voters, whatever their party, know instinctively that not everything performed by a professional is automatically “care” in the moral sense. The white coat does not sanctify the act. “Medical” can describe who performs a procedure; “care” describes what it is for. In common-sense terms, care aims to heal and protect patients. Abortion, by its nature, ends a life.
That is why the high court’s definition matters. Once abortion is judicially placed inside “health care,” restrictions face the highest hurdles.
Natural law begins with a simple idea: Basic rights do not come from the strong. They are grounded in what a human being is.
If the unborn child is a living human being, then that child has at least one right that society must protect: the right not to be intentionally killed.
This straightforward truth doesn’t rely on having the same religious beliefs. It’s simply a matter of human rights. All the great struggles for justice come back to the same fundamental idea: Every person’s dignity is not about how big, strong, smart or independent they are, or whether others see that person as convenient.
That’s exactly why the law exists. The law protects people who cannot protect themselves.
So, when a court treats abortion as a protected “health care decision,” it is not protecting “choice.” It is deciding, implicitly, that the unborn child is not the sort of being the law must protect in the first place, or at least not enough to outweigh the mother’s claim. That’s a moral decision. It deserves public debate, not a quiet redefinition from unelected judges.
Yet there is also another issue at stake that should alarm even people who are conflicted about abortion: the separation of powers.
The founders of our constitutional order, state and federal, assumed something basic: Law in a self-governing republic is made by elected representatives. Courts interpret law; they do not rewrite it. Legislatures debate definitions precisely because definitions carry moral weight. That is why statutes contain words like “reasonable,” “necessary,” “public welfare” and “compelling interest.” These are not mere technicalities; they are the guardrails of representative government.
Wyoming’s Article 1, Section 38 includes an explicit legislative role: “The legislature may determine reasonable and necessary restrictions on the rights granted under this section to protect the health and general welfare of the people.”
Yet this ruling effectively places abortion restrictions under strict scrutiny, the most demanding constitutional standard, by treating abortion itself as a protected “health care decision.” This shifts the practical center of gravity away from the Legislature and toward the judiciary. When judges, rather than voters through their representatives, decide what constitutes “health care,” the judiciary begins to dominate the other branches.
To be clear: Courts must interpret constitutions. But there is a difference between interpretation and transformation. When broad language is used to constitutionalize an issue as morally explosive as abortion, it is fair to ask whether the court has created a new rule of political life without the consent of the governed.
Thankfully, one of the judges, Kari Gray, provided a powerful dissent to the ruling, arguing that the Legislature was operating within its constitutional authority when it, as the elected representatives of the people, placed “reasonable and necessary” restrictions on abortions. That dissent is not just legal quarreling. It is a warning about which branch gets the last word.
If the judiciary can expand or contract the meaning of major words, then constitutional government becomes less a balance of powers and more a rule by judicial interpretation. And the branch least accountable to voters becomes the branch most decisive in moral policy.
If Wyoming wants abortion protected as “health care,” let that be said plainly, debated openly, and, if necessary, resolved through the democratic process the constitution provides.
The answer is not to pretend that words settle moral reality. For a republic to survive, citizens must insist on two virtues: truthful language and separated powers. Lose either one, and self-government becomes nothing more than a slogan.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle said he expects Idaho to conform to many of the federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump, and he expects the Idaho Legislature to pass additional budget cuts during the upcoming 2026 legislative session to pay for the tax cuts and avoid a budget deficit. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The two related issues – whether to conform with federal tax cuts included in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law July 4 and how to avoid projected multimillion Idaho state budget deficits in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 – are expected to be two of the biggest issues shaping the annual Idaho legislative session that begins Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Moyle, other legislators and officials in Gov. Brad Little’s office have all said Idaho will intervene during the 2026 legislative session to prevent the state from posting a budget deficit when the fiscal year ends June 30. And to avoid the shortfalls, legislators are going to propose new, additional budget cuts. 
“There’s going to be some reductions in the budget, and there’s plenty of room for reductions in budgets,” Moyle said in an interview Monday at the Idaho State Capitol. “If you don’t think so, ask any farmer out in the state of Idaho that’s dealing with lower commodity prices, right? Just go find the stuff that doesn’t matter, and you take it out. So I think it can be done easily if we work together. 
“But the part that is going to be the problem is that every budget has somebody that thinks it’s the best budget in the state and has to have everything, and that creates more of those conflicts and makes it harder to get out of here.”
Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, answers a reporter’s question during a press conference on Jan. 6, 2025, at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
The latest state reports show that Idaho is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a state budget deficit of $40.3 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. But the projected budget and revenue shortfalls are not a short-term, one-year problem facing the Idaho Legislature. The Idaho Legislative Services Office reported in the fall that next year’s fiscal year 2027 state budget is projected to have a $555.2 million budget deficit. Longer range state reports also showed a projected gap between expenses and revenues continuing through fiscal year 2028.
Any projected budget deficit is a problem because the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget every year and prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed state revenues. 
 Idaho’s speaker of the House said repealing Medicaid expansion is on the table this year

To pay for balancing the budget, Moyle said legislators will consider repealing Medicaid expansion, which more than 60% of Idaho voters approved at the polls in November 2018. Medicaid expansion provides health insurance to more than 85,000 Idahoans who did not qualify for traditional Medicaid, with the federal government paying 90% of the benefits and the state paying the remaining 10%, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
In December, the Idaho Legislature’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE Committee, issued a recommendation for Idaho to repeal Medicaid expansion. 
On Monday, Moyle said repeating Medicaid expansion is on the table for this year, but he is unsure how much money eliminating Medicaid expansion would save the state budget.
“Heck yeah (it’s on the table),” Moyle said Monday. “I don’t have a problem with that. Everything is on the table. I don’t have a problem with that at all.”
Even though Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion via a ballot initiative in 2018, the Idaho Legislature still has the power to repeal Medicaid expansion, which is treated the same as any other law in Idaho that can be amended or repealed. 
Sen. Scott Grow, an Eagle Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said he also expects additional budget cuts this year, although he did not predict where the cuts will come from. The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, sets every budget for every state agency and department each year. 
“Obviously it will be a challenging session for JFAC,” Grow said in a phone interview. “With the tapering off of revenue increases that we have experienced over the last several years, we are now coming back to a more normal year. But, in fact, this particular year is a little less normal, in that we will have to look at cutting budgets rather than the increases that have been able to happen over the last few years.”
“We will wait and see what the governor’s budget (recommendation) is, obviously but I am confident that in accordance with 3% holdback (Little) has already done, we will have to deal with cuts and some of those cuts may need to be larger than 3% in order to balance the budget,” Grow added. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said Idaho’s budget shortfall is an entirely self-inflicted crisis that was brought on by Republicans in the Idaho Legislature passing years worth of tax cuts the state could not afford and delaying setting revenue projections until after the Idaho Legislature passed several major budgets and tax cuts. 
Rubel opposes repealing Medicaid expansion and opposes additional new cuts to programs and services that Idahoans rely on. Instead of cutting services that benefit low income families, seniors and people with disabilities, Rubel said the Idaho Legislature should instead repeal the most recent income tax cuts and repeal a new $50 million education tax credit that reimburses families for expenses including tuition at private, religious schools.

But with Republicans controlling supermajorities in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature, Rubel worries more and deeper cuts to programs and services are on the way.
“The repercussions of the cuts will be felt far beyond the vulnerable communities who took the hit on the front end,” Rubel said in a December phone interview. “It’s going to hit regular people. It’s going to hit them a lot harder in the very near future, and they are going to want answers.” 
 

	Federal tax changes championed by Trump could cost Idaho hundreds of millions of dollars    

Importantly, Idaho’s projected $40.3 million deficit for fiscal year 2026 and projected $555.2 million deficit for next year do not include the cost of paying for tax changes in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. For individuals, some of those tax changes include no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on borrowers’ car loan interest and an expanded deduction for senior citizens. If Idaho adopts those changes at the state level, making the changes will reduce state revenue even more.
“First off, when we left last year (when the 2025 legislative session adjourned), we left $430 million on the bottom line,” Moyle said. “We didn’t have a problem until July 1, when the Big, Beautiful Bill passed. If you didn’t have the Big Beautiful Bill, we wouldn’t be having this conversation with concerns about a shortfall that was created by the actions of the federal side that we have no control of. Tax conformity is what’s driving the numbers down. There are 39 tax relief components in the Big Beautiful Bill that affect Idaho.”
It is not exactly clear how much conforming to Trump’s tax changes would cost Idaho. A report from the nonprofit Tax Foundation estimated it could cost $284 million annually to conform to the individual and business tax changes in Idaho. 
On Monday, Moyle told the Sun the cost of tax conformity could actually be closer to $400 million in Idaho. 
Either way, Moyle said he expects Idaho to conform to most of the federal tax changes. 
“How we address that will have a lot to do with the budget too,” Moyle said. “That means, if we conform, and I believe we conform to most, if not all of them – most of them, for sure –  if we conform to those, now we’ve got a revenue situation, right?”
Moyle said he does not think Idaho legislators will need to cut funding for the K-12 public school system because student enrollment in public schools has declined and costs will be less as a result. But Moyle said cuts in other areas are all on the table.
“We’ll figure it out,” Moyle said. 
Little will begin the 2026 legislative session Monday when he delivers the annual State of the State address and issues his budget recommendations at 1 p.m. Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. Little’s address, as well as legislative committee meetings and Idaho House and Idaho Senate floor sessions will again be streamed live online, for free, via the Idaho in Session streaming service.

Efforts to impose accountability for those responsible and those involved have largely ended — except in Wisconsin. This means that Wisconsin has the opportunity, and the responsibility, to re-assert the rule of law, to ensure justice, and to bolster the foundations on which American democracy has been built over the past 250 years.
As we assess the state of our democracy in light of this somber anniversary, let’s start with the bad news: 

The U.S. Supreme Court derailed efforts by states to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition against insurrectionists serving in federal office, and then it invented an ahistorical and jaw-droppingly broad doctrine of presidential immunity to derail criminal prosecutions of Trump in state and federal courts alike. 
Federal prosecutions of the violent mob in the Capitol were upended by Trump’s Department of Justice, and Trump issued sweeping federal pardons to every individual connected with Jan. 6, effectively encouraging them to keep it up. 
State prosecutions of the fraudulent electors — those who executed an unprecedented effort to overturn the 2020 election by submitting to Congress (and other officials) paperwork that falsely declared Trump to have won seven key states that he in fact lost and thereby laying the groundwork for the Jan. 6 rioters to violently demand Pence validate their efforts — have faltered, often for reasons unrelated to the merits of those actions. 

But here in Wisconsin there are still grounds for hope. Hope that bad actors who deliberately took aim at our democracy will be held accountable. Hope that our institutions will stand up and protect our democracy from further meddling by those most directly responsible. And hope that those institutions will act promptly to prevent further damage. Every Wisconsinite should be watching the following accountability efforts — and urging our elected officials to use their authority to advance the rule of law and protect our democracy. 
First, the Wisconsin Supreme Court will soon determine the appropriate sanction for Michael Gableman’s ethical transgressions as he spearheaded a sham “investigation” of the 2020 election. Gableman, who once served on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, accepted this job despite his own assessment that he did not understand how elections work in Wisconsin. He wasted taxpayer funds, undermined government transparency laws, dealt dishonestly with his clients and the public, lied to and insulted courts, and tried to jail the elected mayors of Green Bay and Madison. In March 2023, Law Forward filed an omnibus ethics grievance, documenting Gableman’s myriad breaches of the ethics rules that bind all Wisconsin attorneys. Last summer, Gableman stipulated that he had no viable defense of his conduct and agreed with the Office of Lawyer Regulation to jointly recommend his law license be suspended for three years. (He is now trying to wriggle out of accountability by serially pushing justice after justice to recuse.) 
Wisconsin precedent is clear that, where a lawyer is charged with multiple ethical breaches, the proper sanction is determined by adding the sanctions for each breach together. The Court should apply established law, which demands revoking Gableman’s law license. Then the Office of Lawyer Regulation and the Court should act on our requests to hold Andrew Hitt (chairman of the Wisconsin fraudulent electors) and Jim Troupis (chief Wisconsin counsel to Trump’s 2020 campaign and ringleader of the fraudulent-elector scheme) accountable as well.
Second, the primary architects of the fraudulent-elector scheme, detailed in records  obtained through Law Forward’s groundbreaking civil suit, are also facing criminal prosecution in Dane County. Attorney General Josh Kaul’s case is narrowly focused only on three lawyers — two who were based here in Wisconsin, and one working for the Trump campaign in DC — who conceived and designed the scheme to overturn Wisconsin’s results and then convinced six other states to follow suit. Troupis, who himself was appointed to the Wisconsin bench by former-Gov. Scott Walker as a reward for his key role in the 2011 partisan gerrymander, has gone to great lengths to slow down this prosecution, which Kaul initiated in June 2024. He filed nine separate motions to dismiss the case. He accused the judge hearing preliminary motions of misconduct and insisted that the entire Dane County bench should be recused. And now he has appealed the denial of his misconduct allegations. This case, since assigned to a different Dane County judge, will proceed, and it is the best hope anywhere in the country to achieve accountability for the fraudulent-elector scheme. 
Third, on behalf of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and two individual voters, Law Forward is suing Elon Musk and two advocacy organizations he controls for their brazen scheme of million-dollar giveaways to influence the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election. This case is about ensuring that Wisconsin elections are decided by Wisconsin voters, not by out-of-state efforts to buy the results they want for us. We’re waiting for the trial court to decide preliminary motions, but, with another Wisconsin Supreme Court election imminently approaching, there is urgency to clarify that Wisconsin law forbids the shenanigans we saw last year, which contributed to the most expensive judicial race in American history. 
Beginning in 2011, Wisconsin became the country’s primary testing ground for the most radical anti-democratic ideas. From Act 10 to one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, from subverting the separation of powers and steamrolling local control over local issues to hobbling the regulatory state and starving our public schools, Wisconsin’s gerrymandered Legislature adopted idea after idea hostile to democracy. With the end of the nation’s most extreme and durable partisan gerrymander in 2023 and a change in the makeup of the state Supreme Court, however, the tide in Wisconsin has ebbed somewhat. 
Now, improbably, Wisconsin is the place that democracy can best hold the line. We can create accountability for those who have abused power, have undermined elections, and have diminished the ideals and institutions of our self-government. That, in conjunction with Law Forward’s broad docket of work to defend free elections and to strengthen our democracy, sustains my hope.

Colorado will not get money for its Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Social Services Block Grant and Colorado Child Care and Development Fund programs while the federal government conducts a “thorough review of the State’s use of funding for compliance and alignment with statutory requirements,” according to letters sent Tuesday from the Administration for Children and Families, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Colorado is one of five Democratic-led states that are on a funding freeze totaling $10 billion for the three program.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Federal officials are concerned with the “potential for extensive and systemic fraud” in the programs that receive federal funding, and they claim to have evidence the state is illegally dispersing funds, according to the letters. They do not detail any specific incidents or allegations of fraud.
“These concerns have been heightened by recent federal prosecutions and additional allegations that substantial portions of federal resources were fraudulently diverted away from the American families they were intended to assist. Additionally, ACF has reason to believe that the State of Colorado is illicitly providing illegal aliens with (benefits) intended for American citizens
and lawful permanent residents,” the letter regarding SSBG benefits reads. The three letters, one for each program. are nearly identical.
The funding freeze follows a surge of fraud cases in Minnesota involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs. There have not been comparable fraud charges or allegations in Colorado.
The federal government is requesting the “complete universe” of administrative data for recipients of TANF, known in the state as Colorado Works, and SSBG benefits since 2022, including recipient names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, A-numbers and any other state identification numbers. An A-number is a registration number that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement assigns to immigrants for official records.
Officials are also asking Colorado to document how it verifies citizenship of beneficiaries according to federal eligibility rules. And they want information about which organizations received SSBG and TANF dollars since 2019 and how they used the money.
Alex J. Adams, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, wrote in the letters that the administration wants this information by Jan. 20.
“These actions by the Trump administration will hurt vulnerable Coloradans across every part of this state,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “This important help for lower income families is administered by the counties and the sweeping data demands this request would place on counties — especially on short and impossible timelines — are unrealistic and risk disrupting services. No child should go without food, stability, or opportunity because of punitive federal action, and we are exploring all options to make sure Colorado children and families are supported.”
His office did not immediately respond to a question of whether the state would give information about A-numbers and its citizenship verification process.
Colorado receives about $136 million in TANF block grant funding annually, according to the Colorado Department of Human Services. Last December, over 14,000 families benefited.
For the child care funding, Colorado must immediately implement “additional fiscal accountability requirements” including submission of attendance documentation.
“CDHS is currently reviewing the requirements and assessing the potential impacts these will have on Coloradans,” CDHS spokesperson Haysel Hernandez wrote in an email. “The department remains committed to Colorado families and providing critical aid in their time of need.”
The letters do not indicate how long reviews by the federal government could take.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)On the first day that Dan and Zita Elrod stepped foot on a plot of wooded land with a cabin overlooking the Duck River, they spotted an eagle in flight from the back porch.
They were in the market for a peaceful respite from city life, and they took the eagle as a sign. They were sold.
In 2025, nearly two decades later, the couple decided they wanted to preserve the property. They entered into a conservation easement, a voluntary legal agreement between a landowner and a land trust that conserves property by permanently restricting how that land can be used.
The Elrods’ roughly 42 acres overlooking the most biodiverse freshwater river in North America will remain just as they want it — a cabin surrounded by acres of forest — in perpetuity, even if the Elrods decide to sell or bequeath the land some day.
“This is one of the few opportunities you have in this world to do something that’s permanent,” Dan Elrod told the Lookout.
The Elrods’ land is among thousands of acres conserved in 2025 through sales and partnerships with land trusts, conservation organizations and state agencies. 
That protected land includes more than 7,400 acres of bottomland hardwood forest along the Hatchie River that is now a wildlife management area in West Tennessee — a property that multiple land trusts, nonprofits and state agencies worked for years to secure.
Land conserved by private citizens like the Elrods through conservation easements also makes up thousands of the total acres protected in the last year, according to The Land Trust for Tennessee and TennGreen Land Conservancy, nonprofits that work with landowners to preserve natural resources and farmland.










It feels bigger than you. That involves the whole community, that involves the whole state, and that’s something that anybody in the world can come visit and appreciate and realize, wow, this stuff is really worth protecting.


– Jon D. Bumpus, TennGreen


TennGreen Director of Communications Jon D. Bumpus said the organization preserved roughly 3,200 acres in 2025 through a combination of voluntary, landowner-driven conservation easements and land acquisitions. The Land Trust for Tennessee conserved just under 1,000 acres with private landowners last year, mostly in Middle Tennessee, the trust’s Senior Conservation Project Manager Jackson Lundy said.
These properties contain forests, rivers, pastures, a waterfall and habitats for rare, threatened and endangered species. They also have deep personal value to their owners, many of whom seek conservation easements to ensure their land retains its character for future generations, Bumpus and Lundy said.
Both organizations are hopeful that the Farmland Preservation Act — a law passed by the Tennessee General Assembly in 2025 that sets aside $25 million for grants for farmland and forest owners who place their land in conservation easements — will open the door for more landowners once the grant program is finalized this year.
A public rule-making hearing for the act is scheduled for Feb. 12.
“We’ve been overwhelmed with interest,” Lundy said.
How conservation easements work
The Elrods partnered with The Land Trust for Tennessee for their conservation easement, which took about six months to complete. 
Every conservation easement is different, with restrictions on the land created with the landowner “to fit their needs and their desires for how they want their property to be used in the future,” Lundy said.
Easements may restrict the land from being used for certain types of development, like subdivisions, but can still allow farm activity, agricultural buildings, and even timber harvesting, so long as it’s done in keeping with forest management best practices. Each agreement is specific to the land in question, the landowners’ future goals and the land trust’s conservation goals.
“I think a lot of landowners understandably have a visceral reluctance to do something that’s going to really affect (their) land, or that’s going to tie (them) up or take away options,” Dan Elrod said. “Well, you can maintain options as you want to in the process. There’s a lot more flexibility than folks realize.”
Lundy said The Land Trust for Tennessee wants to make as many things available to landowners as possible for future use, but if someone wants to build 20 houses on their farm, “that might not be a good fit for a conservation easement.”
Once the ink dries, the landowners retain ownership of their land.
“They can sell it, they can pass it to heirs, but the conservation easement stays with the deed of the property so that whoever owns it in the future still has to uphold the conservation values that we agreed on,” Amy Frankel, marketing and communications manager for The Land Trust, said.
Lundy works with landowners who are interested in conservation easements and helps them through the process. Last year, he received more than 400 inquiries. The organization uses a screening process that considers farmland use, climate change resilience, water quality, wildlife habitat, historic sites, scenic land and other attributes to determine which projects will best serve The Land Trust’s conservation goals.
After the easement is official, The Land Trust continues to work with landowners to ensure those terms are maintained. They visit each property every year to monitor conditions and keep a relationship with the landowner. In total, The Land Trust has conserved roughly 137,000 across more than 460 conservation easements since its inception in 1999.
If a land trust or conservation easement holder ceases to operate, easements can be legally transferred to another entity to continue stewardship.
Bumpus describes conservation easements as the closest to a “forever clause” a landowner can get.
“It’s not something that can be circumnavigated by state or federal institutions, through the government that we have in place now,” Bumpus said.
Conservation easements do come with costs for the land surveys, appraisals and attorney services needed to put them into place. Landowners who enter into conservation easements may be eligible for tax benefits, but up-front costs can be barriers for some who would otherwise be interested.
Bumpus said he’s looking forward to the release of grant funding from the Farmland Protection Act, which could cover those costs and allow farmers to protect their land for free. 
“That is one of the things that makes me emotional, getting to do this work, because so many of my friends that are in agriculture … they’re very land rich … but it’s so hard to run agriculture in Tennessee, and America in general, (that) you’re not able to save money on the side,” said Bumpus, who owns a small ranch in Goodlettsville where he raises cattle.
“We’ve helped with some funding for conservation easements on agricultural land before, and it’s an unreal feeling,” he said. “It gives me goosebumps every time I think about it, looking someone in the eyes who’s been on their land for 90 years, and it’s seven generations old, and telling them they’re not going to lose it, is, I think, the most powerful thing I’ve ever been a part of.”
Land purchases and state parks
Organizations like TennGreen, The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee and many others also work to conserve land through acquisitions, often pooling resources with each other to purchase land at risk of development.
Bumpus said TennGreen had a nearly even split of conservation easements and acquisitions last year, but the mix varies from year to year. The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee mostly conserves land through acquisitions — purchasing properties from willing sellers. 
The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee chooses tracts of land based on biological diversity and the land’s resistance to climate change, Director of Land Gabby Lynch said.
She cites the Hatchie Bottoms project in West Tennessee as 2025’s “major exciting, uplifting win.”
“It’s one of those lifetime projects that you want to live to see happen, and it happened in 2025,” she said.
Multiple partners, including The Nature Conservancy, TennGreen, The Conservation Fund, Hatchie River Conservancy, Heritage Conservation Trust Fund, and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency worked on the Hatchie expansion. 
Land trusts and conservation organizations frequently work with state and federal agencies to acquire properties near parks, natural areas, wildlife refuges and management areas. Bumpus said conservation organizations are more nimble and can often purchase land and hold it so the state can turn it into a state park later, when it secures funds and clears red tape.
Tennessee opened its newest state park, Head of the Crow, in Franklin County in October 2025, made possible by more than a decade of work from conservation organizations and state agencies. 
The park is now one of three parks in an area formerly known as South Cumberland State Park, which grew to protect more than 30,000 acres. Fiery Gizzard State Park in Grundy and Marion counties was also recognized as a distinct park in 2025.
Bumpus said a highlight of his year was attending the parks’ dedications.
“It feels bigger than you,” he said. “That involves the whole community, that involves the whole state, and that’s something that anybody in the world can come visit and appreciate and realize, wow, this stuff is really worth protecting.”
The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee is working toward protecting 50,000 new acres from 2020 to 2030. After 2025, they have protected about 80% of that goal, meaning they’re “ahead of schedule,” Lynch noted.
The Nature Conservancy began in 1978, and the Tennessee chapter also aims to reach a grand total of 500,000 acres of protected land throughout the state by 2030. They are now nearing 470,000 acres.
While Tennessee continues to grow, Lynch said she has a personal hope going into 2026 for Tennesseans.
“I would love if all of us who walk on this beautiful state that we live in really knew how special Tennessee is, because Tennessee has a lot of superlatives when we talk about biological diversity and climate change resilient habitats,” she said. It’s important, “not just for within the borders of Tennessee, but we’re actually a regionally important conservation state.”

But in 2026, the job market will be tight – and for new graduates, there’s growing competition from artificial intelligence.
The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook survey projects hiring levels for new grads will increase just 1.6% in 2026 after remaining flat in 2025. In that same survey, 45% of employers rated the job market as “fair.”

UPS, Target, and Amazon were among the high-profile companies that announced plans to shed thousands of jobs in the 4th quarter of last year.
And it’s unclear if those jobs will return any time soon.
“I think what you’re talking about there, with respect to some of these large companies making layoffs, it’s AI generated,” said North Carolina State University economist Mike Walden in an interview with NC Newsline.
“We are now seeing AI deployed more, at least planning to be deployed more, into a variety of enterprises,” Walden said.”I think they’re looking at their payroll, they’re looking at employment. And we’ve seen multi-thousands of employee cutback announcements already made.”
Walden believes this is going to be a challenge for prospective employees for the next couple of decades.
Careers that are projected to see major disruptions include: marketing and public relations, interpreters and translators, customer service representatives, and web developers.

“It’s going to bring great productivity. It’s going to probably bring great abilities for a lot of companies to do things they couldn’t have done before. But it may come at a price in terms of less employment or different kinds of employment,” said Walden.
A report by outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found U.S. employers announced more than 71,000 job cuts in November. While restructuring was the top reason given for shedding jobs, AI was cited for 6,280 jobs cut in November and more than 54,000 layoffs last year.
Walden says AI is notably different from any technology we’ve seen over the last hundred years.
“Usually when you think about new technologies, it’s been technologies that replace what I call brawn with a machine. AI is different because it’s replacing cognitive ability, not strength. And in the 21st century, that’s the basis of a lot of jobs,” Walden told NC Newsline.“People get trained in colleges to think, to analyze, to do analysis, to do programming, et cetera. And we’re going to see a lot of that change with a lot of those tasks shifted to AI.”
Improving employability in an AI world 
The key to making a job more AI-resistant may lie in soft skills.
Sumana Northover, Northeastern University (Photo: Northeastern.edu)
Sumana Northover, director of Employer Engagement and Career Design at Northeastern University, believes recent grads and job-seekers who can demonstrate competencies such as critical thinking, clear communication, leadership and teamwork will find it easier to make the transition from college to career.
“What’s interesting is that nationally, students rate themselves higher on these competencies than actual employers rate students,” said Northover during a recent webinar sponsored by The Hunt Institute.
Chelle Travis, executive director of SkillsUSA, agrees that students really need to work on those skills to better understand their strengths and weaknesses.
“I was on a panel not long ago where one of our industry partners said that they are often hiring for technical skills, but they’re firing for soft skills,” said Travis.
Travis said by normalizing work-based learning opportunities, students are more likely to have a leg up on any competition.
“Across this country, we should see students that are participating in internships, apprenticeships, mentorships or other programs that develop graduates with higher confidence, clarity, and employability,” she said.
 Artificial intelligence shapes higher education  
UNC System President Peter Hans has also spent a great deal of time thinking about how artificial intelligence will shape today’s students and tomorrow’s workforce.
“I worry that for every promise AI holds for teaching and learning, it poses an equal threat to motivation and mental effort,” Hans told members of the UNC Board of Governors at their September meeting. “It’s one thing to make use of an AI tool when you’ve already had years of experience honing your mind and your work ethic. But having access to a mental shortcut from your earliest days as a student — an easy button you can press any time things get tough — is a tempting invitation to mediocrity.”
UNC System President Peter Hans says a new Chief AI Officer will oversee AI strategy for the 17-campus system. (Photo: UNC/PBSNC video stream)
Hans said a Chief AI Officer will oversee AI strategy for the 17-campus system. Earlier this month, UNC instructors were invited to help pilot new student AI literacy training modules created by a team of faculty, librarians, and instructional designers for use during the Spring 2026 semester.
“There are already indications that AI is eroding entry-level jobs in fields like computer programming, with more on the way. We have an obligation to deliver the most relevant, most valuable degree possible for our students, and that means closely monitoring the way emerging technology is changing our economy and our society,” said Hans.
That understanding is essential. A new NBC News poll finds nearly two-thirds of registered voters question whether getting a four-year college education was worth the cost given the large amount of debt many students incur. Only one-third agreed the cost was worth it to have a better chance of landing a good job and earning more over their lifetime.
Walden said some students are making that decision because they don’t know if the money and time they spend on a college degree is going to help them get a job in the future if AI is in the mix.
“And we really need to think about this fast, because if we need to retrain people who are laid off because of AI, we need to get those programs thought out and then implemented very quickly,” said Walden.
Leah Burton, SAS Institute (Photo: The Hunt Institute webinar)
The private sector is also closely watching how AI defines the employment outlook. Leah Burton works as a principal industry consultant for higher education at SAS Institute. Burton said the Cary-based company is working with states to integrate education and workforce data to project the job needs of the future. Continually reviewing that data and not letting it sit on a shelf will help states better understand if their education pipeline is meeting industry demand.
“As these changes in the workplace happen, we need to find ways to evaluate, analyze, and make important decisions so that while some jobs are going to become obsolete, workers themselves don’t become obsolete,” said Burton.
For those worried AI may one day eliminate their job, Northover offered some sobering advice.
“Certain jobs are getting phased out,” she said. “But I think that’s an opportunity for us to look at how we’re doing things and how we can use AI to help us do it better. It’s freeing up capacity, brain power, whatever you want to call it, to be able to think and perform on a higher level. Lifelong learning is critical in maintaining relevance.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1359385182-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 06:12:54.792966

(Photo by Ronaldo Bolaños/The Texas Tribune)McALLEN, Texas — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is beefing up its border security efforts along the Rio Grande, expanding on a controversial Texas strategy by placing large, floating buoys along more than 500 miles of the river.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the deployment of the barriers Wednesday during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley that included a roundtable discussion with U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel as well as ranchers whose property is often traversed by migrants moving north after crossing the border.
Standing before one of the buoys — large floating, cylindrical devices that can measure up to 15 feet long and four to five feet in diameter — Noem said 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and were beginning to be installed that day.
This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology. The projects are funded by the 2025 tax and spending megabill, which Trump named the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Noem touted the water barrier as a deterrent to people crossing the border illegally as well as drug smugglers and human traffickers.

Homeland Security and the Border Patrol are working with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission and the state of Texas to ensure proper installation of the buoys, Noem said.
The state of Texas is already familiar with using buoys to deter border crossings. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the installation of a 1,000-foot water barrier along the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass in 2023 as part of his mission to tighten border security, and an additional 1,000 feet of buoys after Trump took office in January 2025.
“Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, press secretary for Abbott, said in a statement Wednesday. “The floating marine barriers deployed by Texas have been a resounding success, and Governor Abbott is proud to work with the Trump Administration and Border Patrol to expand the program. ”
The buoys sparked protests from activists concerned about migrant safety and a complaint from the Mexican government alleging the buoys violated water treaties between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden sued Texas over the buoys, citing similar concerns. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the buoys to remain in place while the merits of the case move forward in a lower court. The state has argued it has the right to defend itself against an “invasion” of drug cartels.
Weeks after the buoy wall was installed in Eagle Pass, Mexican authorities reported a migrant had been found dead, caught on one of the floating spheres. On Wednesday, Noem argued that the water barrier would prevent migrant deaths by discouraging them from trying to cross the river.
“They’ll create a safer environment for agents on patrol, and securing our waterways not only protects Americans, it saves the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water,” Noem said.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho Supreme Court)The Gem State lost an accomplished public figure this year with the Nov. 7 death of Wayne Kidwell at age 87. He was born in Council, Idaho, on June 15, 1938, and raised in Boise, where he supported himself during his last high school years. He spent many years faithfully serving the public in local, state and federal offices.
Kidwell graduated from Boise High School in 1956, obtained a B.A. degree from the University of Idaho in 1960 and a law degree from the U of I in 1964. He interrupted his studies twice – first, to serve a year in the U.S. Marine Corps and, again, to serve two years as an officer in the U.S. Army Military Police Corps, including a tour on the DMZ in Korea. He attained the rank of captain.
Kidwell’s first elective office was as Ada County prosecutor. He then went on to be the second Idahoan elected to the top level of all three branches of state government. In 1968, he was elected to the state Senate, where his Republican colleagues chose him as majority leader. He was elected as Idaho attorney general in 1974, defeating the incumbent, Tony Park. In 1998, he was elected to the Idaho Supreme Court, retiring in January of 2005. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1972 and 1980. He was expected to run for governor in 1978 but decided instead to spend time with family.
In 1980, Kidwell was appointed as the first attorney general of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Two years later he was appointed associate deputy attorney general for the Reagan administration’s Department of Justice. His responsibilities included the department’s liaison with the White House. 
Kidwell’s tenure as Idaho’s attorney general was remarkable. He hired attorneys based on their qualifications, rather than political affiliation. He hired an excellent consumer protection chief, even after the candidate volunteered he’d voted for Kidwell’s opponent. He had courage, as evidenced by his fertilizer anti-trust lawsuit against the J.R. Simplot Company in 1975. When I was introduced to Jack Simplot in 1983 as Idaho’s new attorney general, he said, “I hope you don’t file a lawsuit against me like that knothead Kidwell.”
In a 1976 argument to the U.S. Supreme Court, Kidwell convinced the justices that Idaho should be allowed to sue Oregon and Washington for endangering salmon and steelhead by overfishing the runs. Both of his AG successors carried on with that lawsuit. In addition to providing competent legal advice and representation to the state, Kidwell steadfastly championed consumer protection, victims’ rights and scrupulous observance of the law, both by the public and by governmental entities at all levels.
I became acquainted with Wayne in 1974, when he attended a meeting of the Jerome County Republican Central Committee to gain support for his attorney general campaign. I was a member of the committee, but I had already committed to support his primary election opponent, Tim Hopkins of Idaho Falls. That may have gotten us off to a bad start. 
During his two campaigns for a position on the Supreme Court in the 1990s, I supported his opponent both times. He lost his 1994 race but won in 1998. It just so happened that I ran for the court in 2004 and took the position he was vacating. During the transition, we finally got to know each other and became good friends. 
We met for lunch frequently, and he soon invited me to join him and a former Ada County District Judge, Duff Mckee, for a weekly luncheon meeting at Eddie’s Restaurant on Overland Road in Boise. Our trio was dedicated to discussing and solving the problems of the state and nation. 
I learned that Wayne was vitally interested in the world around him. He studied the cosmos, ancient civilizations, scientific theories and natural phenomena. He was an armchair expert on coffee with at least three high quality espresso machines so as to make the very best brew. 
About four years ago, we invited Wayne’s 1974 opponent for the AG’s job, Tony Park, to make it a lunch foursome. The foursome got along famously, viewing most social and political issues in the same light. It’s interesting how the passage of time can wisen your views and break down barriers. Unfortunately, our group lost both Tony and Wayne in 2025. May they rest in peace.

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)A Colorado organization is leading two ballot measures that would restrict rights for transgender children in the state. 
Protect Kids Colorado, a coalition led by prominent anti-LGBTQ activist Erin Lee, is gathering signatures for ballot measures that would prevent transgender children from participating in school sports and receiving gender-affirming surgeries. Lee led several anti-LGBTQ initiatives that the Colorado Title Board rejected ahead of the 2024 election. 
The group has until Feb. 20 to submit 124,238 valid signatures from registered voters for each initiative to the Colorado secretary of state’s office. If that threshold is met, the measures would be placed on the November 2026 ballot.

Z Williams, co-director of the Denver nonprofit Bread and Roses Legal Center, said both of the issues the ballot measures seek to address are relatively minute. Williams said they have yet to see “actual validated science” that supports the need for the initiatives. 
“The number of trans athletes is incredibly small, and the number of gender-affirming surgeries done for transgender youth or minors is even smaller,” Williams said. “We have two ballot measures … that are going to require hundreds of thousands of dollars, waste a lot of time, create a lot of confusion during the election over two pretty much manufactured issues.”
Protect Kids Colorado did not respond to Newsline’s request for comment on the initiatives.










Coloradans value freedom, a freedom that belongs to everyone, including transgender youth and their families.


– Cal Solverson, spokesperson for One Colorado


There isn’t clear data on the number of transgender student athletes in Colorado, and the two major hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors do not offer surgeries to minors.
Cal Solverson, spokesperson for LGBTQ+ advocacy organization One Colorado, said the ballot measures are ill-informed and jeopardize individual freedom. They also put transgender people, their families and health care providers across the state at risk, Solverson said. 
“Coloradans value freedom, a freedom that belongs to everyone, including transgender youth and their families,” Solverson said in a statement. “The right to exist as we are extends beyond the exam room to the playing field, where every child deserves the opportunity to stay active, develop life skills, and experience the deep camaraderie of a team.”
If the measures make it to the ballot, Solverson said One Colorado trusts that Colorado voters will defend transgender youth and “ensure that freedom continues to exist for all Coloradans and not just some.”
Prohibit certain surgeries on minors
Ballot Initiative 110 would prohibit health care professionals from knowingly performing any surgery on a minor “for the purpose of altering biological sex characteristics.” 
The measure would also prohibit state and federal funding including Medicaid from being used to pay for gender-affirming procedures.  
Children’s Hospital Colorado and Denver Health have paused gender-affirming care for youth amid the Trump administration’s threats to pull Medicaid and Medicare funding entirely.   
A document on Protect Kids Colorado’s website says that Children’s Hospital Colorado performs gender-affirming surgeries on minors, but Children’s Hospital said in a statement that it has never provided gender-affirming surgical care to patients under 18, and it stopped offering such surgeries to adults in 2023. Denver Health stopped offering surgeries to minors in early 2025.
The document also says that while the ballot measure only targets gender-affirming surgeries, the organizations has “a multi-pronged plan to outlaw puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors as well.”
The language in the initiative includes medical terms that aren’t necessarily related to surgery, such as prescriptions. It also applies to health care professionals such as podiatrists, dentists and chiropractors, who wouldn’t be performing gender-affirming surgeries in the first place. That adds concern about how the measure would affect other elements of gender-affirming care, according to Mardi Moore, CEO of LGBTQ+ advocacy group Rocky Mountain Equality. 
“It’s kind of like they’re throwing the spaghetti at the wall to see what’s going to stick,” Moore said. “There’s not a lot of people you can trust anymore, and I think Protect Kids Colorado is one of those groups that cannot be trusted to think they will keep all children safe.”
If the measure passes, it would lead to discriminatory practices in medical care, affecting all children, not just transgender children, Moore said. 
Male and female participation in school sports
Ballot Initiative 109 would create definitions in state statute aiming to define boys and girls based on physical anatomy, excluding transgender people. 
Sports teams sponsored by schools or athletic associations would be required to expressly designate those teams as for men, women or co-ed. Schools and their athletic departments would be required to adopt policies implementing the requirements of the initiative.
The measure would not affect any student’s ability to participate in co-ed sports. 
The state’s commissioner of education would be tasked with enforcing the measure, and would have discretion to determine how to “take appropriate remedial action” against any school not in compliance with its requirements. 
“It would mean a little 8-year-old who loves to play soccer and who happens to be trans couldn’t play anymore,” Moore said of Initiative 109. 
Colorado is known to be a safe place for LGBTQ+ people, Williams said, and families have moved to the state from around the country because they share those values. 
“When I was a kid, we were ‘the hate state,’ and Colorado has unequivocally disavowed that stance,” Williams said. “So I think we need to remember that these are folks that are trying to use a very marginalized community to rebuild a political ideology that’s been rejected for a very long time here.” 
Protect Kids Colorado is running a third ballot measure to increase penalties for people convicted of human trafficking of a minor.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s Senate Republicans released a slim priority agenda Wednesday — targeting waste, fraud and abuse in Indiana’s food and health care benefit programs.
Senate Bill 1, authored by Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, focuses on ensuring that only U.S. citizens receive aid.
“Americans are outraged by the billions of dollars of welfare fraud in our nation — and the Minnesota scandal is Exhibit A,” a news release said. The bill is “Indiana’s latest effort to catch bad actors to preserve programs like SNAP and Medicaid for Hoosiers who need them most.”
Only one other bill was highlighted: Senate Joint Resolution 1, authored by Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford.
The resolution is the second prong of a three-part process to amend the Indiana Constitution. The founding document makes nearly everyone eligible for bail, but the proposal would allow judges to deny bail to anyone they deem a “substantial risk.”
The measure has already passed one Legislature and now must pass in 2026 to be added to the November ballot for a public vote.
The third priority noted was to continue prioritizing fiscal discipline “in the face of increased pressure from Democrats to prematurely spend taxpayer money” and by ending the 2026 legislative session “ahead of time and under budget.”

The legislative session is scheduled to run through the end of February.
The bulk of the Senate Republican agenda is tightening regulations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. Garten said about half the bill is simply conforming to recent federal changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Garten’s legislation would increase eligibility checks for SNAP, prevent illegal immigrants from claiming benefits and update Indiana’s laws to comply with federal Medicaid reforms, including work requirements for able-bodied, working-age adults.
“The days of asking hardworking Hoosiers to subsidize lawlessness are over,” Garten said. “Our public safety net exists to support our most vulnerable citizens — not those who have broken our laws to enter the country. If you are here illegally, you are disqualified from receiving Hoosier tax dollars, and we will report you to federal authorities. It is that simple.”
The news releases offered no examples of fraud or waste in the systems.
Garten told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he doesn’t know the number of noncitizens receiving benefits.
“That’s part of the problem,” he said.
Senate Bill 1 would mandate verification of immigration status for all Medicaid and SNAP applicants. And it goes further: any applicant who cannot verify legal presence would be immediately referred to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for investigation and potential deportation proceedings.
Last year, Indiana lawmakers added work requirements for able-bodied Hoosiers on Indiana’s Healthy Indiana Plan. Months later, the federal government did the same; Garten’s bill will match the federal requirements and go into effect in 2027. Additionally, HIP enrollment will now be every six months instead of annually.
The state would also adopt the federal definition of medically frail. The language specifically says the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration can’t expand the definition administratively.
“That’s a limit switch for us as a Legislature. We don’t want the agency to expand Medicaid rolls,” Garten said. “It’s our fiscal lever.”

According to some reports, explosions were heard in Caracas and other cities near airports and military bases around 2 a.m. (Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)The U.S. military action to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro Saturday night has divided the candidates running for Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District. 
The swing district is set to be among the most high profile congressional races in the 2026 midterm elections as Democrats try for a third time to unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden. President Donald Trump won the district in 2024 with 53% of the vote. 
Since Trump’s inauguration, Van Orden has positioned himself as a vocal supporter of the president, often appearing at White House events and loudly defending Trump on social media. 
That defense extended to the Venezuelan raid, of which Van Orden, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, described on X as “perfect.”
“I would like to commend @realDonaldTrump, @SecWar, and the members of our glorious military that conducted the raid in Venezuela to capture the narcoterrorist Maduro,” Van Orden wrote on X shortly after the news of the action was announced. “Perfect operational security and execution.”
Despite regularly criticising American “forever wars,” Van Orden has praised the Venezuela attack as part of an effort to prevent the flow of drugs into the U.S. 
“This operation sends a clear message to America’s adversaries: harming U.S. citizens carries consequences,” Van Orden said in a statement. Nicolás Maduro operated as a narco-terrorist under the false cover of political authority. His criminal network helped fuel the drug trafficking that has killed thousands of Americans. He is now detained and no longer in a position to threaten American lives. President Trump’s decisive leadership made this possible. His administration has made it clear that America will no longer tolerate narco-terrorists who profit from the deaths of our citizens.”
While Van Orden’s defense of the president is expected, two of the Democrats running in the primary to succeed him have diverged on the issue. 
Rebecca Cooke, who ran against Van Orden in 2024 and is widely seen as the frontrunner, criticized the lack of a long term plan in Venezuela and the break from Trump’s campaign promise to stay out of foreign wars, but celebrated the unseating of Maduro despite the lack of congressional involvement in the decision to approve military action on a foreign country. 
“Donald Trump and I don’t agree on much, but one thing we used to agree on is ending American involvement in endless foreign wars,” Cooke said in a statement. “I applaud the excellent work of the CIA and Delta teams in capturing a ruthless dictator in Nicolas Maduro — but where is the concrete plan for stability in the region? We haven’t seen one yet. Without it, our nation involves itself in another foreign conflict. I am disappointed — as I’m sure many Wisconsinites are disappointed — to see this administration betray a central promise when communities across Western Wisconsin are struggling.”
Cooke also said she thinks the president should be more focused on domestic issues.
Emily Berge, the president of the Eau Claire City Council who is running against Cooke in the Democratic primary, criticized the military action without any laudatory comments about deposing Maduro. 
“Derrick Van Orden and Donald Trump promised to be ‘America First’ and to end the longstanding waste of our tax dollars bombing other countries based on fabricated stories all in the pursuit of foreign oil,” Berge said in a statement. “They are both breaking their promises to the American people.”
Across the country, criticism of the attack has focused on the president’s decision to go into Venezuela without approval from Congress — which under the U.S. Constitution retains the authority to approve the use of military force. 
On X, Van Orden supported the lack of congressional notification before the operation, agreeing with a post that stated telling Congress would have resulted in details being leaked to the press. 
However, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin has co-sponsored legislation prohibiting the use of military force in Venezuela without authorization by Congress. 
“President Trump stormed into Venezuela and is drawing the U.S. into another forever war just to take Venezuela’s oil and enrich his big oil buddies,” Baldwin said in a statement. “Simply put, this is not what Wisconsin families signed up for. This puts all the men and women who don the uniform at risk, reeks of corruption, and just shows the President is focused on everything except lowering costs and the issues that keep Wisconsin families up at night. The President cannot just start wars at a whim; he needs to get the people’s approval – and that means Congress signing off.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for the Tennessee Lookout)As we enter 2026, the United States is not simply polarized. We are disoriented. 
There is a widening crisis of faith in democracy, governance, the economy and religion. 
Institutions once trusted to anchor public life now feel distant, compromised or hollow. For many, especially in Black communities, the question is no longer whether the system is broken, but whether it still belongs to us at all.
This crisis is not merely emotional. It is structural. And it is deeply tied to the weakening relationship between our electoral process and the institutions historically responsible for shaping moral clarity, political literacy and prophetic imagination. For Black communities, those institutions have been consistent and indispensable: Black churches and Black educational institutions, particularly historically Black colleges and universities.
When these institutions are underfunded, marginalized, or reduced to symbolic relevance, democratic participation erodes. Civic education thins. Political engagement becomes reactive instead of intentional. Moral formation gives way to confusion, cynicism, and despair.
Nowhere will this reality matter more in 2026 than in Memphis and Shelby County.
Locally, we are navigating a public safety conundrum shaped by contradiction. Crime has declined and did so before the creation of the Memphis Safe Task Force in September. That fact deserves honesty. 
But it is not the full truth. Many residents still do not feel safe. Violence remains too present in too many neighborhoods. For law abiding Black and Hispanic Memphians — the majority in Memphis — law enforcement strategies often feel more like profiling than protection.
The contradiction has produced a fractured narrative. Local and federal entities point to data and demand celebration. Many Black Memphians point to lived experience and demand accountability. When our political and civic leaders refuse to hold both truths at once, trust erodes. Public safety becomes a political talking point rather than a shared moral responsibility.



				When these institutions are underfunded, marginalized, or reduced to symbolic relevance, democratic participation erodes. Civic education thins. Moral formation gives way to confusion, cynicism, and despair.			


This tension will be magnified by the electoral calendar. In 2026, Shelby County voters will face three elections: a county primary in May, a combined county general and state and federal primary in August and national midterm elections in November. These elections will test more than turnout. They will test whether people still believe democracy belongs to them.
If democracy is to mean anything tangible this year, we must be willing to name clear goals. One such goal should be a minimum 20 percent increase in voter turnout in each election compared to the previous cycle. Not as a symbolic aspiration, but as a measurable indicator of whether our institutions are educating, mobilizing and empowering the public.
That level of participation does not happen accidentally. It must be cultivated. Historically, Black churches and HBCUs have done this work by pairing civic education with theological grounding and political discernment.
In Memphis, that work is already happening, often without sufficient support. At Abyssinian Baptist Church, civic engagement is treated as a moral and theological obligation, not a seasonal activity. Through initiatives like UPTheVote901 — a civic organization designed to boost voter turnout, and one in which I am involved — we work to educate and mobilize voters while protecting their dignity without partisan alignment.
At LeMoyne-Owen College, an HBCU founded to educate and empower formerly enslaved people, civic formation remains central to its mission of producing critically conscious graduates equipped to serve and lead.
But voter participation alone is not enough.
Renewal of democratic values in Shelby County requires full funding of Black institutions
The second goal for 2026 must be the full and sustained funding of Black institutions, not merely Black-led organizations. There is a difference. Too often, white-controlled institutions place Black leadership at the forefront while maintaining extractive power structures behind the scenes. That is not empowerment. It is cover.
If Memphis and Shelby County are serious about democratic renewal, Black institutions accountable to Black communities must be resourced to operate with independence, integrity, and longevity. This includes churches, HBCUs, and grassroots civic organizations committed to long-term formation rather than short-term political gain.
This work must also be grounded in an expanded Memphis People’s Agenda, which was developed from more than 2,000 community surveys identifying core concerns around the City budget, labor and wages, housing and the environment, education, and public safety. The Agenda should function not as a static document, but as a living framework that aligns policy priorities with the lived realities of working people, young people, and those most impacted by violence, disinvestment, and political neglect.
This is not a call for partisan loyalty. It is a call for institutional integrity.
Black churches must reclaim their prophetic voice without becoming campaign machines. HBCUs must deepen civic engagement without fear of political retaliation. And the public must recognize that prophetic institutions require more than praise. They require participation, trust, and financial investment.
2026 is a make-or-break year for Memphis and Shelby County. Not because of any single election or task force, but because of what this moment demands collectively. Democracy is not self-sustaining. Freedom requires formation.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-08 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Thriving in the NIL era, Ole Miss turns into an unlikely college football powerhouse","David Brandt, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/08/nil-ole-miss-unlikely-football-powerhouse/,"Mississippi platers and coach celebrate a win against Georgia after the Sugar Bowl NCAA college football playoff quarterfinal game, Friday, Jan. 2, 2026, in New Orleans.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Keith Carter had a premium vantage point at the Sugar Bowl for arguably the biggest moment in Mississippi’s college football history, standing directly behind the goalposts as Lucas Carneiro’s 47-yard field goal split the uprights.
The Ole Miss athletic director scooped up the football and tucked it under both arms, hugging it tight like a fullback as he ran through the end zone in jubilation.
The 49-year-old Carter — who played basketball for the Rebels in the late 1990s — didn’t play a snap in Ole Miss’ 39-34 victory over Georgia in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals. But in some ways, he might be the most important person for a football program that hasn’t acheived this much success since the early 1960s.
He is also the man working to keep Ole Miss on top.
“We want to go win the whole thing this year, obviously,” Carter said. “But our hope is to be right back here next year and be a program that’s an every-year CFP contender with a chance to win national championships.”

Such talk would have sounded crazy less than a decade ago when Ole Miss was mostly an afterthought in the SEC, dealing with the fallout of an NCAA investigation into rules violations and a messy breakup with then-coach Hugh Freeze.
But as the No. 6 seed Rebels prepare to face No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday with a spot in the national championship game on the line, it doesn’t feel nearly as far-fetched.
Thanks to a group of behind-the-scenes people that includes Carter and Walker Jones — who leads the Ole Miss NIL collective — the Rebels have thrived in the pay-for-play era, building a fundraising behemoth that’s given them resources to build a roster that includes quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, running back Kewan Lacy and a defense stacked with NFL-caliber talent.
Chambliss recently committed to return to the Rebels next season pending NCAA approval. He said Ole Miss has all of the resources it needs to compete at the highest level.

“I feel like college football’s changed throughout the years,” Chambliss said. “NIL changed that. The transfer portal changed that. The college football playoff changed that. I feel like Ole Miss, being in the SEC, the best conference in the nation, you’re going to get guys. You’re going to get good guys and coaches want to coach there. Ole Miss has done a good job transitioning with how college football is transitioning itself.”
Jones played football for the Rebels in the 1990s before a business career that included more than a decade with Under Armour. He came back to Ole Miss in 2022 to lead The Grove Collective, which is the athletic department’s fundraising arm.
Carter and Jones have known each other since their days playing Ole Miss sports and that connection was crucial.
“I always talk about the trust Keith had in me to come back in this capacity during a very confusing and complex time,” Jones said. “That probably wasn’t easy. I credit our history together and the experience of being student-athletes together.”
The Rebels were quick to adapt to the NIL era under coach Lane Kiffin, who iprovided the recruiting. Carter and Jones provided the money and a juggernaut was born.
Now Kiffin is gone — headed to LSU after an awkward breakup — but the money remains. Jones has cultivated a group of roughly 7,000 donors in The Grove Collective who range from millionaries to college students. It’s all impressive for a school that has a large following, but not the same kind of massive alumni base of schools like Ohio State or Texas.
“We may not have a T. Boone Pickens or a Phil Knight,” Carter said, referring to the well-heeled donors for Oklahoma State and Oregon. “But when you put us all together collectively, pull the rope in the same direction and people give not only what they can, but maybe even a little above what they should, we’ve been able to be really good.”
Ole Miss’ staying power has been evident over the past 12 months after last year’s disappointing ending to the season. The Rebels spent a boatload of money in 2024 for a roster that included quarterback Jaxson Dart, but they went 9-3 in the regular season and didn’t make the playoff.
Jones and Carter weren’t deterred and the donations kept pouring into the program. One year later, they’re exactly where they want to be. Even losing Kiffin hasn’t stopped the momentum; Carter quickly promoted Pete Golding and the Rebels keep chugging along.
“You’ve seen this before in sports,” Carter said. “There’s a team with all the expectations and you fall a little short. Then the very next year, you look up, and there’s a team that’s maybe not as heralded or doesn’t have as much preseason hype. But the pieces fit perfectly, the locker room is right, all these intangible things happen and it’s the best team in school history.”
It’s all new territory for an Ole Miss program that hasn’t been a powerhouse since the 1950s and ’60s, back before integration. The Rebels claim three national championships in football, though none since 1962.

There were a few good moments in the ensuing decades: Eli Manning was the team’s quarterback during a few heady years in the early 2000s, the Rebels won the Cotton Bowl in 2008 and Freeze had it rolling for a few years in the mid-2010s before NCAA troubles arose.
All those flashes of national relavance faded quickly.
Now because of Carter, Jones and a whole lot of cash, this version of Ole Miss might stick around for a while. Carter is soaking in the moment.
“It’s not just for me,” Carter said. “I’m the one who gets recognized and is the one out in front, but there are so many people who deserve this. I’m so happy for our fans, the ones who have been through some ups and downs.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232241/AP26002189253468.jpg,,,2026-01-08 06:12:54.792966

No chair. Even though your job could be done sitting. Sounds bad, right? Now imagine you’re sick. Sore back. Aching foot. Elderly. Same rules apply.

(Photo by Luis Alvarez/Getty Images)Imagine working somewhere that forces you to stand. No chair. Even though your job could be done sitting. Sounds bad, right? Now imagine you’re sick. Sore back. Aching foot. Elderly. Same rules apply. For tens of thousands of West Virginians, this is a daily reality. The topic is normalized. Ignored. Forgotten — except by those experiencing it. 
Here’s the deal: Clerks, cashiers and service workers should be allowed a chair or stool. It’s a real issue. And has nothing to do with efficiency. America confuses hardship with productivity. We embrace a culture of austerity that treats worker suffering as acceptable. 
Many folks stand for entire shifts. In one place. On unforgiving floors. The work does not require it. The rule does. And it prevents many from working. Those who are able just shoulder the pain. Before a body part gives out. Chairs would improve workforce participation, health and fairness. 
The other day I was using the self checkout at Walmart. A young worker stood monitoring a screen. I asked how her feet were holding up. She confided she was born with a spinal condition. Standing hurt. I asked if she was permitted to sit. She said she was allowed only if she was injured. Confused, I asked if she had asked her supervisor. She hadn’t. Feared being reprimanded. Or told no. She also added that she had no medical documentation.
Europeans do it differently. This issue first crossed my consciousness living in the Netherlands as a West Virginia Rotary Scholar. When I went to the store, cashiers had elevated stools. All of them. At register height. I’ve never seen an American cashier ringing up a product while seated in my life. 
In the Netherlands, seats are provided by law. A human right. And guess what? Work gets done. Lines move. No drama. And another note: Dutch cashiers are younger on average than West Virginia workers. It’s considered a job for youth there. 
Retail and service jobs are some of the most common employment options in West Virginia.  Walmart employees thousands. It has historically been our single largest private employer. For America, also. 
West Virginians are not so healthy. Standing in one place for hours makes it worse. Stresses aching bodies. According to West Virginia Public Broadcasting, in 2025, West Virginia remained the most overweight state in the country. Over 40%. And more than 15% report a disability that limits daily activities. Providing chairs is a low-cost intervention that prevents fatigue, pain and absenteeism. 
Here’s another kicker: To add insult to injury, service jobs often have lower wages. This can add extra stress. Many cannot afford a car. They rely on buses, rides from others or long walks. People are exhausted before they even get to work.
I’m a long-distance runner. I put my feet through pain by choice. One night of standing — one time as a restaurant hostess — left my feet aching. Standing in place felt more painful than running a race. 
And another point: A no-sitting rule does not impact all equally. It disproportionately harms older workers. Pregnant or disabled workers may not even apply. A stool costs pennies compared to turnover and workplace injury. This is not radical. It is common sense. Sitting does not harm business. It protects people. Europe figured this out decades ago. A simple truth: bodies matter. 
West Virginia should pass a law on this. It’s stupid not to. We can do better. Bottom line? The option to sit is not a perk. It’s a health necessity. Common sense. Safety, productivity and fairness demand it. The next time a politician talks about improving worker participation they should bring up stools. West Virginia bodies are not disposable.

(Photo courtesy of History Colorado)In 1876, Coloradans could travel by train between Denver and Boulder or Greeley or Colorado Springs. But this convenience, since lost, belied the Colorado Territory’s infancy.
The Eastern Plains were mostly empty. The Western Slope, where recent treaty terms reserved much of the region for the Ute people, was as yet bereft of such communities as Grand Junction, Glenwood Springs and Aspen. Just 250 people resided in the hamlet of Breckenridge.
Denver, where roughly 20,000 lived — about the same number of residents in Durango today — boasted one saloon for about every 400 people. Its commercial sector also included three gun shops, three music shops, nine banks and nine newspapers.
These and other revealing facts are reported by Chase Woodruff in a story published Jan. 1 to launch a special Newsline project. Called Colorado at 150, the project marks Colorado’s sesquicentennial — 150 years of Colorado statehood. Colorado entered the union as the Centennial State on Aug. 1, 1876, under President Ulysses S. Grant.

The project comprises several parts. One features stories like Woodruff’s and will offer a window on what life was like in Colorado 150 years ago. Called “Timeline 1876,”  this part will also note important events from that year. To do this, we’ll draw on historic newspapers and other archival resources, including those maintained by History Colorado.
Another part will explore the people and events that helped define Colorado, good and bad, over 150 years of statehood. Think of the Ludlow Massacre in 1914, the establishment of Rocky Mountain National Park in 1915, the last detainees leaving the Camp Amache Japanese incarceration site in 1945, Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex issuing the nation’s first same-sex marriage license in 1975, John Elway leading the Denver Broncos to a Super Bowl victory in 1998. These and other consequential moments form the soul of Colorado.
We’ll also highlight sesquicentennial events that are planned throughout the year, such as “38th Star: Colorado Becomes the Centennial State,” an exhibit at the History Colorado Center in Denver that will run through Sept. 6. As Woodruff has reported, the America 250-Colorado 150 commission, established in Colorado law, has approved 12 “signature initiatives” related to the sesquicentennial. These include a documentary film series, a new historic marker program, a “digital passport” program to encourage Colorado tourism, and an oral history project. At least two events are planned for the Aug. 1 anniversary, including the Mile High 150 Expo at the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield.
The celebration of 150 years of Colorado coincides with the celebration of 250 years of the United States of America — a milestone with its own awkward name, semiquincentennial. We have a special interest in Colorado, but we’ll also cover events in the state related to the country’s anniversary.
It’s a fraught time to ruminate on the country’s history. Many people in Colorado and beyond are aghast at the lawless behavior of a federal administration that so often disregards the founding laws and principles of the United States, and they wonder how much of the American promise is left to celebrate. Historian Jill Lepore, in the New Yorker, recently described the mood in ominous terms: “In a year that has already seen multiple political assassinations, the deployment of the National Guard to American cities, and masked agents of the federal government hauling people off the streets and into unmarked vans, the prospects for a peaceful anniversary appear remote.”
But a thorough and honest exploration of how we got here could only help the state and the country chart where to go. Colorado at 150 will highlight moments in the state’s history that are sure to inspire pride. It will also recall painful episodes. But an unflinching view aligns with the rest of our journalism, which assumes that truth is always the basis for an informed community that can act with clarity and confidence for its own interests.
We’re also interested in your perspective. Many Coloradans have a connection to people, events and communities that helped shape the state’s history. If that describes you, let us know. We want to hear your story.

(Courtesy of Dominion)The Virginia Clean Economy Act pushes the commonwealth towards a complete renewable energy portfolio in a few short decades. One challenge the law’s opponents often cite is that solar energy is not as easily dispatchable as gas power. 
With battery storage technology becoming more mainstream, VCEA proponents are aiming to ramp up the state’s investment in them and proposing bills to that effect to be debated in the 2026 legislative session, starting next week.
Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, one of the original sponsors of the VCEA, announced Wednesday he’s bringing back his bill to revise the law to increase the amount of battery storage Virginia’s major utility companies will need to invest in by certain benchmark years laid out in the law. A dual bill will be filed in the Senate by Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond.
“In order to meet the challenges our commonwealth faces, we must do more. More than last year’s bill required. Virginia should be leading, not trailing,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax.
Under the current law, Dominion Energy is required to petition the State Corporation Commission for 2,700 MW of battery storage by 2036, and Appalachian Power Company is required to petition for 400 MW. Sullivan said that the bill he is bringing this year will “significantly” increase that amount. At the time of the press conference on the bill on Wednesday, the final numbers had not been published.
The goal of the increase is to bring down costs through generating power during the cheaper times of day and dispatch the stored power when it is most needed. The bill will also have requirements for amounts of short-range storage and long-range storage batteries, which is usually separated by above and below six to eight hours of storage.
The cost to build the batteries, like any energy infrastructure, will be added to customer bills through riders. Sullivan stressed that the cost of these batteries is much less than the cost to build fossil fuel plants or even small nuclear reactors. He also pointed out that the batteries could be placed on the grid much faster than the alternatives.
“The numbers are clear,” Sullivan said. “… the levelized cost of storage is way below any other form of generation of power. So we will have to spend money on better storage? Yes. It will save us from spending more money on other forms of generation.”
The bill also directs the SCC to evaluate the projects to ensure the most cost effective methods as well as adjust safety measures to align with national standards.
Conservatives have bristled at the idea of mandating additional storage as the technology is still fairly new and expensive, while Democrats emphasized that costs have been reduced in recent years. 
Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said he supports more gas power plants as they are able to produce more megawatts than an average solar and storage project.
“I am for all of the above,” Kilgore said, echoing outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s energy generation plan for the state. “But we have to be realistic about the fact that in the commonwealth there is not enough solar capacity there to meet our needs over the next two to five years and that is what we need to be more concerned about.”
Dominion recently petitioned the SCC for its largest investment in solar and battery storage projects to date – with 11 projects totaling over $2.9 billion. Appalachian Power has had some challenges with storage facilities after they canceled one project in an outage-prone area due to hurricane damage.
Another bill that is being filed by Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, directs the SCC to take stock of where existing transmission lines are not being fully utilized at power plants, such as gas peaker plants that don’t run at full capacity most of the year. Locations that are identified to have additional energy capacity space would allow for solar and battery storage to be placed at the power plants to put more renewable power on the grid.
“We can use the assets that we have, like the transmission system, much more efficiently. So we take advantage of what we’ve already spent as a society and we use it better (through) batteries,” said John Zahurancik with Fluence, an Arlington based battery storage company.
Each of the bills will be debated during the regular legislative session that begins on Jan. 14.

(Photo by Ben Cunningham/Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance)A controversial transfer of a trail project to Virginia’s passenger rail authority was pushed through by Transportation Secretary Shep Miller on Tuesday after a vote by the Commonwealth Transportation Board resulted in a 6-6 tie, drawing scrutiny of the board’s process and the project’s future. 
After the board’s vote of support, the project was transferred to the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, which will oversee $35 million in grant funding for preservation and improvements by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation.
Events leading up to the vote drew mixed reactions from lawmakers and the public. Many questioned the cost, transparency, and feasibility of a rail-with-trail versus a trail-only project for the dilapidated, 50-mile Shenandoah rail corridor, which has been inactive for 36 years.
After the board failed to reach consensus to delay the vote, the agency’s recommended plan moved forward. 
“At the end of the day, I stand by what I recommended to you, what the governor and administration recommend to you, because we think that’s in the best interest of the citizens of the commonwealth,” Miller said on Tuesday.
He said that further delay could jeopardize the project, including the planned merger between Norfolk Southern Corporation, which owns the rail line, and Union Pacific Corporation. Miller added that public input remains part of the plan.
Under the terms of the transfer, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation would buy the rail line from Norfolk Southern. The remaining funds would be used to build the trail and meet state lawmakers’ criteria.
The agreement tasks the foundation with building the trail by certain deadlines, and gives it the authority to preserve the rail corridor for future passenger use, clarifying operational roles and risk responsibility.
For some, the vote was disappointing, as they hoped to boost the region’s economy and promote healthier lifestyles with a multi-use trail; others see more potential in restoring the Manassas Gap rail line and building a parallel trail.
During the meeting, about 17 speakers addressed the board. Some called for swift action, while others raised concerns specifically about the foundation, which is facing legal disputes over its authority to be involved in the project.
The foundation told the Mercury it will return to court in the spring to prove it did not exceed its authority in joining the rail trail project. 
VDOT projections indicate a recreational trail would cost $164 million, while restoring the rail line with an adjacent trail would cost $687 million, directly influencing project feasibility and choice. 
Rail supporters say those estimates are too high.
Before Miller’s decision, board member Laura Sellers had moved to delay board action until public input sessions were complete. This followed reports from board members and lawmakers that scheduled public hearings on the third and final assessment report did not occur.
“…the motion to delay and table is not to make a stand for one way or the other, is to provide time to ask these questions, to go through the study… and to allow the public comment period to take place,” Sellers said. “It’s not to choose one side or the other. It’s simply to give us more time.”
Board member Raymond Smoot Jr. supported the rail-with-trail plan and said it addresses those concerns by ensuring public input and requiring evaluation of proposals from interested groups.
“I believe that the project (can) be handled in such a way that will preserve the corridor for possible future rail use — that could be at a time that is probably unknowable today — but it would preserve that option going forward,” Smoot said. “I personally would hope that all of the groups that are interested in this project would come together and unite behind a proposal that may involve various groups, but one that will assure that this is developed as provided in the resolution.”
VPRA will be responsible for scheduling public meetings, according to the board’s resolution. No dates have been scheduled as of Wednesday morning. The agency will also be responsible for considering and evaluating any proposals submitted by “established organizations” by Feb. 15.
Proposals must include a trail alongside the rail while preserving the corridor/rail for potential future use. VPRA said it does not expect a potential rail line to be immediately developed. 
CTB will vet and review the agreement and any subsequent proposals and contract terms before work begins

There are 190 dual-use marijuana dispensaries in Ohio, meaning they can sell medical and non-medical marijuana, according to the Division of Cannabis Control.  
More than 130 Ohio municipalities and townships have moratoriums in place banning the sale of adult-use cannabis as of Dec. 2, according to Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law. 
Senate Bill 56 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law last month that made various changes to the state’s voter-passed marijuana law, including adding crimes such as making it illegal to bring legally purchased marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 56, which is set to take effect in March. The bill also bans intoxicating hemp products. 
On the marijuana side, it will reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
The bill gets rid of protections against discrimination for housing, employment, and organ donation. It also allows police to have probable cause during traffic stops if someone is a known user of marijuana. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. It also requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
Ohioans for Cannabis Choice recently launched a referendum effort in an attempt to stop the law from taking effect.

(Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)In another move away from federal health agencies under President Donald Trump (R), the Moore administration wants to authorize the state’s health secretary to recommend vaccine schedules for Marylanders.
Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said legislation that would grant her that authority is a direct response to “the endless changes at the federal level around vaccine policy,” including recent changes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surrounding childhood vaccinations.
“Vaccines remain one of the most powerful public health tools that we have to keep ourselves, our families and our communities healthy and safe from disease,” she told reporters in a virtual briefing Wednesday. “Now more than ever, with the swirl of uncertainty at the federal level, evidence-based data will continue to be our North Star.”
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump (R) issued a memorandum tasking U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the CDC to reevaluate childhood vaccines based off of “best practices from peer, developed countries.”
The CDC then announced it was reducing the number of vaccinations recommended for all children.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

Now, vaccinations protecting children against rotavirus, influenza, COVID-19 and hepatitis A and B are recommended only for those with severe health complications, or after consultation with a health care provider, rather than being broadly recommended for all children, as they had been.
Since Trump took office for his second term, various agencies in his administration have bucked decades of vaccination recommendations supported by top medical organizations and a majority of scientific research. That has led to public confusion over vaccine safety and best practices, say advocates and Maryland Health Department officials.
“As a pediatrician, the most important thing for me,” MDH Deputy Secretary of Public Health Meg Sullivan said, “is that parents have all of the information they need and have all of their questions answered.
“I do think right now that parents out there are confused. We are really committed to trying to provide clear recommendations for parents at the state level,” she said.
In the 2025 session, the General Assembly passed House Bill 1315, which locked in vaccine recommendations that were issued under the Biden administration. That law ensures that health insurers operating in the state continued to cover vaccines as recommended from that year regardless of federal guidance under the next administration.
The new legislation, referred to as the Vax Act of 2026, would allow the Maryland health secretary to issue vaccine recommendations without being tied to a federal agency, though the secretary would be able to consider federal guidance when issuing recommendations.
“Where the statute currently is, it says that insurance providers have to cover vaccines as of what the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices recommended on Dec. 31, 2024,” Seshamani said. “So it was frozen in time.
“What this legislation would do, it would enable there to be a more dynamic determination of what are the recommended vaccines that insurance providers have to cover,” she said.
The bill is stil being drafted, according to state officials.
The Moore administration has already taken steps to preserve vaccine recommendations from a pre-Trump era.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

In addition to HB 1315, lawmakers also approved legislation that expanded authority for  pharmacists to administer vaccinations without a prescription. And in November, Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a new program to help uninsured and underinsured individuals get access to vaccines at local health departments in certain counties.
Maryland also joined the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a coalition of states opposing the Trump administration’s approach to vaccine recommendations, but issuing their own vaccine recommendations based on guidance from medical societies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
The Vax Act would prompt the health secretary to turn to those organizations for vaccine recommendations, while considering the guidance of federal agencies and entities as “elective,” according to a press release on the proposed legislation.
“The federal government has traditionally been a place for trusted information. I think that in the current environment, states are stepping up,” Seshamani said. “We are continuing to look at the guidelines from leading medical organization that have been using decades of science to help guide their recommendations.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1768-cropped2-e1767867295635-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 05:58:49.981541

Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican, speaking to the House, Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Ever since two state courts directed the Legislature to increase state spending on public schools, Republicans have made clear they disagree.
In its July decision in Contoocook Valley v. State of New Hampshire, known as the ConVal case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found that the amount of money the state sends to support public schools is unconstitutionally low. The court called on lawmakers to fix the funding formula, but did not direct how or when. 
“It is now incumbent upon the legislative and executive branches to remedy the constitutional deficiency that we have identified,” the 3-2 majority opinion states.
But as lawmakers returned to the State House Wednesday, deep splits emerged between Republicans and Democrats over how to respond to that decision. 
Democratic lawmakers have called on their colleagues to follow a 2023 ruling by Rockingham Superior Court Judge David Ruoff, in which Ruoff found that the state needed to provide at least $7,356.01 per student to fulfill its duty to provide an adequate education
On Wednesday, Democrats argued for a bill to do just that. House Bill 651 would have honored Ruoff’s decision and required an immediate increase in spending on schools. 
But Republicans have been critical of Ruoff’s decision — much of which was upheld by the state Supreme Court last year — and they voted down HB 651 along party lines, 190-155. They have questioned both the conclusions reached by the court about school funding adequacy and the court’s very authority to instruct the Legislature to spend more. 
Speaking on the House floor, Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, urged the court to “stay out of the legislative lane.” 
“Trains sometimes jump the tracks, causing disastrous wrecks, and that is exactly what will occur in New Hampshire if the cost to provide a K-12 student education is left to the judicial branch,” Ladd said.  
The comments reflected a widely expressed position among Republicans: that last year’s ConVal ruling is not legitimate and does not need to be immediately followed. Yet other Republicans have expressed more moderation. In his own speech opposing HB 651, Rep. Walter Spillsbury, a Charlestown Republican, said the House Education Funding Committee would spend 2026 exploring how to respond to the ConVal decision and find a solution ahead of the 2027 budget cycle.

Senate President Sharon Carson, meanwhile, suggested the Republican Senate majority might have an answer to the ConVal ruling even sooner.   
“I’m going to ask you to hold tight and watch,” Carson said at a press conference Wednesday morning. She said Senate Republicans would soon produce a late-filed bill that would address the court ruling, but did not elaborate. 
Democrats in both chambers say the Legislature must respond more quickly to the courts and follow their decisions. HB 651 would have raised the base per-pupil amount of funding the state sends to schools from the current $4,266 to $7,356.01, the exact minimum amount identified by Ruoff in his 2023 decision. The bill would have also raised the additional “differentiated aid” — sent by the state to students who are low income, are English language learners, or who receive special education services — by similar levels. 
A separate Democratic bill, House Bill 491, would have created a study committee to look into “alternative methods” for funding public education to reduce reliance on property taxes. House Republicans also voted that bill down Wednesday, 195-157, after arguing a study committee is unnecessary and any analysis should be done in the existing education committee.
Addressing the House, Rep. Richard Ames, a Jaffrey Democrat, said HB 651 should have passed, noting the Supreme Court’s ruling came after three years of litigation and a three-week evidentiary trial. Ames said the court had reached a key conclusion: that New Hampshire local property tax burdens vary widely from town to town because the state is not sending enough funding to public schools to cover basic costs. 
Adopting the increases in HB 651 would allow New Hampshire to “meet, at an admittedly minimum level, our state constitutional school funding obligations,” Ames said.

Meanwhile, Rep. David Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat, pushed back at the arguments that the Supreme Court had overstepped its authority. “The nonsense … about the Legislature having sole authority is an attack on separate but equal branches of government and violates our oath to uphold and defend the constitution,” he said. 
To many Republicans, following Ruoff’s ruling would be cost-prohibitive, forcing the state to raise around $500 million more in revenue per year for the Education Trust Fund to cover the $7,300 payments. Ladd noted that the court is asking the state to increase its per-pupil spending amounts at a time when New Hampshire schools are steadily losing enrollment. 
Instead, argued Ladd, the state’s school funding concerns should be answered by local school districts reducing their own budgets by cutting back on administrative costs.
“There are a number of considerations beyond revenue that should also be taken to address education funding, such as increased fiscal accountability and monitoring,” he said. 
On Wednesday, House Republicans passed two bills to attempt to enforce that financial discipline. House Bill 121 would require school districts to commission annual audits of their finances and would empower the State Board of Education to place school districts under probation if they are deemed to have conducted financial mismanagement or violated the law. That probationary period could allow the State Board, whose members are appointed by the governor and Executive Council, to choose an outside administrator to run the school district for up to two years. The bill passed, 187-154; it will need Senate approval next.
And the House was set to vote on an amended version of House Bill 675 Thursday, which would prohibit school districts’ annual budgets to increase beyond inflation every year unless a two-thirds majority of voters chose to override the cap. 
That latter proposal, once a relatively fringe idea in the Republican party, has grown in popularity in the last year, rising to become a central policy plank for House and Senate Republicans. 
Democrats have fiercely opposed the proposal, arguing it tramples on local control and prevents simple majorities of residents from being heard when it comes to school funding decisions. 
But Carson argued mandatory tax caps would force school boards to be more realistic about the need to downsize in the face of declining enrollments. “They’re not looking five, 10, years down the road at what’s going on in education and preparing for that,” she said of school boards. “That’s not the state’s fault. They’re doing budgeting that’s not taking account the reality of what’s happening in our state.”
One key Republican has held back on endorsing the budget cap proposal. Asked about the legislation at a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte declined to take a position. But she did echo some of her party’s sentiments. 
“I will say this: I do think that there has to be accountability at every level to taxpayers,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1075260-Ladd-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 05:12:17.636766

At the same time, the administration is trying to consolidate the bits of personal data held across federal agencies, creating a single trove of information on people who live in the United States.
Many left-leaning states and cities are trying to protect their residents’ personal information amid the immigration crackdown. But a growing number of conservative lawmakers also want to curb the use of surveillance technologies, such as automated license plate readers, that can be used to identify and track people.
Conservative-led states such as Arkansas, Idaho and Montana enacted laws last year designed to protect the personal data collected through license plate readers and other means. They joined at least five left-leaning states — Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington — that specifically blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from accessing their driver’s license records.
In addition, Democratic-led cities in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Washington last year terminated their contracts with Flock Safety, the largest provider of license plate readers in the U.S.
The Trump administration’s goal is to create a “surveillance dragnet across the country,” said William Owen, communications director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger privacy laws.










We're entering an increasingly dystopian era of high-tech surveillance.


– William Owen, communications director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project


“We’re entering an increasingly dystopian era of high-tech surveillance,” Owen said. Intelligence sharing between various levels of government, he said, has “allowed ICE to sidestep sanctuary laws and co-opt local police databases and surveillance tools, including license plate readers, facial recognition and other technologies.”
A new Montana law bars government entities from accessing electronic communications and related material without a warrant. Republican state Sen. Daniel Emrich, the law’s author, said “the most important thing that our entire justice system is based on is the principle against unlawful search and seizure” — the right enshrined in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
“It’s tough to find individuals who are constitutionally grounded and understand the necessity of keeping the Fourth Amendment rights intact at all times for all reasons — with minimal or zero exceptions,” Emrich said in an interview.
ICE did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Automated license plate readers
Recently, cities and states have grown particularly concerned over the use of automated license plate readers (ALPRs), which are high-speed camera and computer systems that capture license plate information on vehicles that drive by. These readers sit on top of police cars and streetlights or can be hidden within construction barrels and utility poles.
Despite widespread interest, only 3 states passed license plate reader laws this year

Some cameras collect data that gets stored in databases for years, raising concerns among privacy advocates. One report from the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive think tank at New York University, found the data can be susceptible to hacking. Different agencies have varying policies on how long they keep the data, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a law enforcement advocacy group.
Supporters of the technology, including many in law enforcement, say the technology is a powerful tool for tracking down criminal suspects.
Flock Safety says it has cameras in more than 5,000 communities and is connected to more than 4,800 law enforcement agencies across 49 states. The company claims its cameras conduct more than 20 billion license plate reads a month. It collects the data and gives it to police departments, which use the information to locate people.
Holly Beilin, a spokesperson for Flock Safety, told Stateline that while there are local police agencies that may be working with ICE, the company does not have a contractual relationship with the agency. Beilin also said that many liberal and even sanctuary cities continue to sign contracts with Flock Safety. She noted that the cameras have been used to solve some high-profile crimes, including identifying and leading police to the man who committed the Brown University shooting and killed an MIT professor at the end of last year.
“Agencies and cities are very much able to use this technology in a way that complies with their values. So they do not have to share data out of state,” Beilin said.
Pushback over data’s use
But critics, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, say that Flock Safety’s cameras are not only “giving even the smallest-town police chief access to an enormously powerful driver-surveillance tool,” but also that the data is being used by ICE. One news outlet, 404 Media, obtained records of these searches and found many were being carried out by local officers on behalf of ICE.
Last spring, the Denver City Council unanimously voted to terminate its contract with Flock Safety, but Democratic Mayor Mike Johnston unilaterally extended the contract in October, arguing that the technology was a useful crime-fighting tool.
The ACLU of Colorado has vehemently opposed the cameras, saying last August that audit logs from the Denver Police Department show more than 1,400 searches had been conducted for ICE since June 2024.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

“The conversation has really gotten bigger because of the federal landscape and the focus, not only on immigrants and the functionality of ICE right now, but also on the side of really trying to reduce and or eliminate protections in regards to access to reproductive care and gender affirming care,” Anaya Robinson, public policy director at the ACLU of Colorado.
“When we erode rights and access for a particular community, it’s just a matter of time before that erosion starts to touch other communities.”
Jimmy Monto, a Democratic city councilor in Syracuse, New York, led the charge to eliminate Flock Safety’s contract in his city.
“Syracuse has a very large immigrant population, a very large new American population, refugees that have resettled and been resettled here. So it’s a very sensitive issue,” Monto said, adding that license plate readers allow anyone reviewing the data to determine someone’s immigration status without a warrant.
“When we sign a contract with someone who is collecting data on the citizens who live in a city, we have to be hyper-focused on exactly what they are doing while we’re also giving police departments the tools that they need to also solve homicides, right?” Monto said.
“Certainly, if license plate readers are helpful in that way, I think the scope is right. But we have to make sure that that’s what we’re using it for, and that the companies that we are contracting with are acting in good faith.”
Emrich, the Montana lawmaker, said everyone should be concerned about protecting constitutional privacy rights, regardless of their political views.
“If the government is obtaining data in violation of constitutional rights, they could be violating a whole slew of individuals’ constitutional rights in pursuit of the individuals who may or may not be protected under those same constitutional rights,” he said.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/ct-partnership-insurance-plan-lost-23-million-last-fiscal-year/,The health plan for municipal and other public-sector workers outside CT government paid more in claims than it received in premiums in FY25.,"The state-run health plan for municipal and other public-sector employees outside of state government paid almost $23 million more in claims than it collected in member premiums last fiscal year, according to a new report from Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s office.
But Scanlon said this week the Connecticut Partnership Plan remains fiscally sound and generally has performed in the black since member premiums were adjusted in 2019.
“The partnership plan, like every other health plan in the United States of America, had a tough time last year,” Scanlon said, referring to surging hospital service fees and medical inflation in general.
Since the early years of the coronavirus outbreak in 2020 and 2021, hospitals have been pressed to raise wages to avert staff shortages while federal Medicaid and Medicare payments failed to keep pace with medical inflation, according to the American Hospital Association. Patients also have been coming to facilities in greater numbers, and with more complex health problems, since the pandemic.
The plan paid out nearly $731.4 million in claims in the 2024-25 fiscal year, which wrapped last June 30, about $22.6 million more than the premiums it collected from the roughly 60,000 public-sector workers and their family members that it serves.
That data, included in Scanlon’s latest report on the program, sparked a sharp response from minority Republicans in the General Assembly.
Sen. Tony Hwang of Fairfield, ranking Senate Republican on the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield, called it “a precursor to universal, single-payer health care in Connecticut” in a joint statement.
The legislature voted in 2015 to establish the partnership to give municipal and other non-state public-sector workers another option for health coverage besides the plan offered by their municipality or regional governmental entity. Of Connecticut’s 169 cities and towns, 109 have a least a portion of their workers covered through the partnership.
The comptroller’s office administers the program and contracts with private companies to manage benefits.
In its first two fiscal years of operation, the plan paid out $31 million more for claims than it received in premiums.
The legislature responded by changing premium calculations, which triggered higher fees for many enrollees.
Hwang and Harding also noted state officials transferred nearly $40 million from an emergency federal COVID-relief grant into the partnership five years ago to keep the program balance healthy.
And, Republican lawmakers asked, if state officials will tamper with this public program to keep it afloat rather than rely on the private insurance industry to cover these public-sector workers, what other state-sponsored health coverage programs are coming? 
But Scanlon, a Guilford Democrat, said the partnership plan is healthy, despite last fiscal year’s numbers — and GOP posturing.
“I guess the clock struck 2026 and it’s campaign season, and the Senate Republicans are dusting off their playbook of old tropes and scare tactics,” he said.
Scanlon added that “I don’t view that [2025 performance] as a harbinger of impending doom and crisis,” he said. “I view that as what’s happening to everybody is happening to us.”
But programs like the partnership and insurance plans offered by private companies have to struggle with rising hospital and other medical costs — a problem that could get worse in future years as huge cuts in federal health care funding make it harder for more and more Americans to regularly visit a primary care physician.
The comptroller added that since lawmakers reformed the premium-setting process, premium collections have exceeded claim payments in four of the last six years. And over longer periods of time, most plans finish periodically in the red, he said.
Scanlon added that his office “is working always to find ways to save,” including trying to negotiate savings each year by steering participants to generic prescription drugs when possible.
“We’re not just accepting these increases as a fait accompli we can do nothing about,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0910_SR_StudentLoanRoundtable_139-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-08 05:12:17.636766

Nationwide, the report found more than 500,000 abortions were given in that time period, and 27% of abortions in the first half of 2025 were done through a telehealth service.
The use of telehealth services has increased since the WeCount surveys began in 2022, with usage up from 25% in 2024 and just 5% in 2022, researchers stated.
Most of the increases were in the 13 states with “shield laws,” that is protections for medical professionals who provide abortions in states where abortion is banned or restricted.
Nearly 15,000 abortions per month were provided under shield laws by June 2025, the study stated.
“Telehealth has become a lifeline for people accessing abortion care, especially those in states with abortion bans,” according to Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a statement announcing the WeCount findings. “But this care is under assault by abortion opponents’ relentless attacks on mifepristone and telehealth.”

But legislation in the Ohio General Assembly has caused concern for physicians and pro-abortion advocates about how protected not only abortion itself will be in the future, but telehealth access specifically.
Ohio has also seen legal debate over telehealth, in a case in which a Hamilton County court has blocked a 2021 law prohibiting telehealth abortions three times.
Dr. Alison Norris, a public health professor at Ohio State University spoke out against a bill recently passed out of the Ohio House that would require an in-person exam and follow-up for any drug categorized as having severe adverse effects in more than 5% of users. She spoke in the House Health Committee in October, saying the level of scrutiny on reports of severe adverse effects needs to be higher than the bill allowed. She also said limiting the ability for Ohioans to use telehealth would impact many people on many medications, but would directly impact medication abortion access as well.
Norris is listed as a co-chair of the just-released WeCount study, and is also a co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, a group of academics and medical professionals who research the state of contraception and abortion care in the state.
As legislation continues to make the rounds in the Ohio Statehouse that would directly and indirectly impact reproductive health care, Norris said even in a state with protections, diligence when it comes to measures holding abortion care providers to different standards is needed to make sure legislation doesn’t effectively create bans.
“Abortion bans don’t stop people from needing and pursuing essential abortion care,” said Norris, who is also co-chair for the Society of Family Planning’s WeCount study. “Telehealth is helping people in states with bans to access abortion care – and yet it isn’t the answer for everyone. Abortion bans are causing harm (in other states), and all too often, your access to health care depends on where you live and how much money you have.”
Despite a patchwork of coverage and protections from state to state, the U.S. has still seen an increase in abortions, from an average of 80,000 monthly abortions in 2022 to 99,000 per month from January and June of this year, according to the society’s study.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)On its first day back in session, the New Hampshire Senate considered multiple bills held over from last session on waste regulation, continuing a long-running discussion on the topic and upholding the trend of Senate and House divergence on the matter.
On Wednesday, senators passed an amended version of House Bill 707, legislation retained from last session that proposes a new process for landfill site evaluation.
Under the bill, landfill proposals would be considered by a seven-member committee evaluating a set list of criteria. HB 707 also calls for state regulatory and policy interests to take precedence over “local regulations and restrictions” in the landfill siting process, citing “a compelling state interest in maintaining adequate, reasonably priced disposal capacity for solid waste generated in New Hampshire.”
Those provisions are contained in a replace-all amendment authored by Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican; with Pearl’s amendment, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee recommended the bill, 5-0, in October.
At the time, some representatives who had sponsored the House bill reacted negatively to the Senate’s amendment, including prime sponsor Rep. Kelley Potenza, a Rochester Republican. As approved by the House, earlier versions of the bill also sought to reform the landfill siting process. But Potenza said in October the criteria in the Senate amendment were not stringent enough. The amendment sacrificed local control, she said, while giving concessions to the waste industry.
Sen. David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican, said Wednesday the amended bill was “targeted” at one project in particular: a landfill in Bethlehem owned by Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems. 
The town of Bethlehem has attempted to regulate the landfill at the local level, through town votes and a legal agreement with Casella. As amended, Rochefort said, the bill could take those decisions out of residents’ hands.
In a letter sent to lawmakers on Tuesday, the Bethlehem Select Board also expressed opposition to the amended bill.
“Local officials are best positioned to weigh competing interests, impose appropriate conditions, and respond to site-specific impacts. State-level preemption of these responsibilities sets a troubling precedent that extends well beyond landfill regulation,” the board wrote.
On Wednesday, Rochefort introduced a floor amendment he said would strengthen local control in the siting process outlined by the bill. He also rejected the argument that increased landfill capacity would be a significant public benefit, saying the state had enough capacity to dispose of its waste in its currently operational landfills. 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee members David Watters, a Dover Democrat, and Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat, spoke in favor of the floor amendment. But Pearl spoke against it, saying its financial impact was unknown.
The amendment ultimately failed, 12-12; soon after, the Senate voted in favor of the amended version of HB 707. The amended bill will return to the House for further discussion this session.
Later on Wednesday, the Senate passed another bill aimed at regulating waste: House Bill 451, establishing a drop-off paint can recycling program, passed 13-11. 
Senators also considered two more waste-related bills held over from last year on the consent calendar: House Bill 171, establishing a moratorium on new landfills, was voted inexpedient to legislate, while Senate Bill 226, which also called for a moratorium on new landfills as well as the study of incineration as a disposal method, was referred for interim study.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/senate2-1.7.26-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 04:57:24.761367

Is that your experience?
Do Ohio politicians have an outstanding record of winning big for Ohio residents? Do you feel like they are looking out for you?
Have they turned Ohio into a destination among our 50 states? Making life affordable for Ohio families? Providing top-notch education? Access to health care? Access to opportunity? A thriving climate for both entrepreneurs and workers? The best roads, bridges, and transportation infrastructure? Public safety, quality of life?
Is Ohio a beacon of democracy for voters? Are voters respected? Are our elected officials accountable, mindful, and responsive to the needs and wishes of everyday Ohioans, and not beholden to narrow special interests or corporate influence?
What candidates are running for statewide office in Ohio in 2026?

Perhaps you think yes. Perhaps you think no.
You’re in luck either way.
This year, you will get to decide, Ohio voter.
You get to decide whether the Buckeye State is “on the right track” or “heading in the wrong direction,” as the pollsters love to put it.
Every single statewide executive office is up for open election: Ohio governor, attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, and treasurer.
We also have two Ohio Supreme Court races to decide, and another U.S. Senate election for the third congressional cycle in a row.
Ohio Republicans are trying to hold onto the control over all three branches of state government they’ve had since 2011.
Ohio Democrats are trying to win their first statewide executive branch offices since 2006.
It’s been eight years since we last had open races for these executive offices.
Each of the current incumbents won reelection in 2022, but all are term-limited out of seeking reelection again, though three are attempting to shuffle from their current position into a different statewide executive office.
So what are the big highlights in Ohio over the last seven years?
I’ll just get out of the way and share some significant headlines from the Ohio Capital Journal and other news outlets throughout Ohio, and you can decide for yourselves what you make of it, as you consider what you think ought to happen next.

Six years ago, it seemed like the Midwest was well on its way to building the first offshore wind farm in the Great Lakes. Then the project withered on the vine — and a civil lawsuit puts the blame on utility FirstEnergy’s bribery scheme in Ohio.


That corruption scandal is best known for leading to the 2019 passage of House Bill 6, a law that gutted the state’s clean energy standards and forced consumers to pay nearly half a billion dollars in subsidies for uneconomical coal plants.


But the bribes also led to a regulatory decision that effectively killed the Icebreaker wind farm proposed off Cleveland’s shore, claims the lawsuit filed in July by Lake Erie Energy Development Corp. — the nonprofit that spent more than a decade trying to launch the clean energy project.


The group, known as LEEDCo, zeroes in on FirstEnergy’s bribes to Sam Randazzo, who formerly headed both the state’s Power Siting Board and Public Utilities Commission. LEEDCo argues that those payments led to a 2020 ruling that imposed unworkable restrictions on when the Icebreaker project’s turbines could operate. By the time the restrictions were revoked, funding for Icebreaker had collapsed. The nonprofit is suing FirstEnergy for monetary damages that could top $10 million.


Icebreaker ​“represented a generational opportunity for the region,” said Jay Kelley, managing partner at Elk & Elk and one of the lawyers representing LEEDCo. ​“It would have positioned Cleveland as a national leader in offshore wind, created a new advanced-manufacturing supply chain, supported jobs, and strengthened the region’s climate-resilience and economic-development goals.”

The Icebreaker demonstration project called for six turbines to be built approximately 8 miles northwest of Cleveland. Although relatively small, its roughly 20 megawatts of clean electricity would have been enough to power thousands of homes. Just as important to LEEDCo was proving that offshore wind generation was feasible in the freshwater lake. If so, proponents in the public and private sectors hoped to leverage the region’s strengths in engineering, steelmaking, maritime, and other fields to help the sector take off.


“The big dream was to build an industry here,” recalled Lorry Wagner, who served as LEEDCo’s first executive director until he retired in late 2019.


By that time, the organization had spent millions of dollars on offshore wind studies, and it had lined up the developer Fred. Olsen Renewables to build Icebreaker once approvals came through. In 2018, the project cleared the federal government’s environmental review process. LEEDCo was also deep into discussions with several Ohio agencies and had applied for a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board.


By May 2019, LEEDCo had agreed to various permit conditions supported by the Power Siting Board’s staff, two environmental groups, a trade association, and a carpenters’ union. After a hearing that autumn on the fairness of that settlement, the project’s only remaining hurdle was to get the board’s final approval.


When that ruling finally came in May 2020, the board, led by Randazzo, imposed a whole new condition: Every night from March through December of each year, Icebreaker’s turbines would have to ​“feather,” or shut down.


“When it came out, everybody was shocked,” Wagner said.


LEEDCo appealed to the Power Siting Board to remove the restrictions. A bipartisan group of 32 lawmakers urged Randazzo to reverse the ruling. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s office fielded similar complaints. The board finally removed the ​“poison pill” provision in October 2020, although Randazzo remained highly critical of Icebreaker.


By then, however, Fred. Olsen had withdrawn from the project. According to LEEDCo, that loss of both funding and technical expertise meant it could no longer meet its obligations for a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. When the Ohio Supreme Court later upheld the permit without the ​“poison pill” in 2022, LEEDCo still didn’t have new funding. On Dec. 8, 2023, LEEDCo said it was freezing Icebreaker.


 What was FirstEnergy’s role?

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Just a few days before LEEDCo paused Icebreaker, the federal government indicted Randazzo on criminal bribery, fraud, and conspiracy charges related to HB 6 and other matters. He also faced criminal charges from the state of Ohio and the prospect of losing his law license.

FirstEnergy admitted in 2021 that it paid $4.3 million to one of Randazzo’s companies shortly before Gov. DeWine nominated him to lead the Public Utilities Commission. According to that federal court filing, the payment was in return for Randazzo taking official action on HB 6, along with ​“other specific FirstEnergy Corp. legislative and regulatory priorities, as requested and as opportunities arose.”


LEEDCo claims that stopping the Icebreaker project fell into the general category of other opportunities in which Randazzo furthered FirstEnergy’s interests. The nonprofit alleges in its filings that FirstEnergy thought competition from the Icebreaker project would cost its subsidiaries more than $5 million in lost revenue per year.


LEEDCo wants the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to make FirstEnergy pay monetary damages to make up for the alleged wrongdoings: interference in LEEDCo’s contracts and business relations, along with corruption and conspiracy in violation of Ohio law.


“Pursuing relief is not only justified — it is necessary to make LEEDCo whole for the years of investment, planning, and opportunity lost,” Kelley said, adding that when wrongful conduct delays or derails a project like this, it doesn’t just hurt one company. ​“It holds back an entire region’s ability to compete and innovate.”


FirstEnergy asked the court to dismiss the case in August, arguing that LEEDCo’s allegations are based on insufficient evidence and that too much time has passed since the alleged wrongdoing. FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the company has no further comment beyond its case filings.


LEEDCo filed its brief against the motion to dismiss in October. Judge Cassandra Collier-Williams has scheduled the next case conference for late January.


If the case moves ahead to pretrial fact-finding, called discovery, LEEDCo will gain access to various FirstEnergy documents, and the nonprofit’s lawyers will be able to question people under oath. But LEEDCo may need to make its case without testimony from some key witnesses.


Randazzo died in April 2024, so he can’t testify about his arrangements with FirstEnergy or any documents concerning Icebreaker. Randazzo forwarded at least one Icebreaker-related document to himself, using an email connected to one of his companies that received money from FirstEnergy.


The Fifth Amendment would likely protect former FirstEnergy executives Chuck Jones and Michael Dowling from making statements that could be used as evidence against them in criminal cases. FirstEnergy’s lawyers identified Jones and Dowling as people who paid the bribes in the HB 6 scandal. The two men still face charges in state and federal court.


Icebreaker, for its part, has changed hands.


Maryland-based developer Mighty Waves Energy, which is not part of the lawsuit against FirstEnergy, acquired the remaining permit rights for the project last year and is working on meeting the Power Siting Board’s preconstruction conditions. But even if it can do that and get enough people to agree to buy the project’s power, Mighty Waves may well face headwinds, including high interest rates and the Trump administration’s persistent attacks on renewable energy.

(Getty Images)I overlooked my flu shot this winter. Over the Christmas holiday, I paid the price.
My entire family was felled by the flu. I’m not talking about cold-like symptoms for a couple of days. I’m talking about total immobilization, hacking coughs and fevers above 102 F. It was misery. We had to cancel family celebrations on Dec. 25, reconvening a couple of days later.
Even after the worst of the illness had passed, we all spent a second week working through fatigue, coughing fits and brain fog.
Data from Kansas and across these United States shows that we were far from alone. Information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending Dec. 27 shows influenza at a “very high” level in the state. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reports 424 deaths this flu season from respiratory viruses, after 1,482 deaths the previous season.
Nationally, at least 5,000 have died this flu season, with nine of those deaths among children, according to the CDC.
“There’s no doubt about it,” said Michael Phillips of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine to NBC’s Today. “It’s an unusual season. It’s been severe, with a rapid onset.”
The tidal wave of infection bore down even as I wrote this column. Wednesday evening, the University of Kansas Health System revealed that more than 100 patients had been hospitalized with both the flu and similar illnesses.
So yes, you can count this one as the real deal. After years of grappling with COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (known as RSV), it might sound comforting to confront the familiar old flu. But this variant, identified as subclade K of the H3N2 variety, has torn through the world. Over in the United Kingdom, the ever-sedate press has dubbed it the “super flu.”
So we’ve established that it’s a problem. What should you do about it? What should my family and I have done?
First and most importantly, we should have been vaccinated. While this season’s vaccine doesn’t specifically protect against subclade K, evidence suggests it protects against severe illness. The more people get vaccinated, of course, the greater protection against illness across the community.
We couldn’t have elevated Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a worse time. He has overseen this week’s evisceration of the childhood vaccine schedule, in which officials no longer recommend protecting kids against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, meningitis, respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus.
Children will die. They already have, this flu season. When ideology trumps public health or common sense, no one bothers much about the corpses of defenseless kids.
But I digress.
All the measures promoted by public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic remain sensible. Wear a mask to protect both you and others. Wash your hands. Stay at home if you become sick. Don’t force yourself to work or otherwise exert yourself while feeling ill. Rest, drink plenty of fluids and contact health care professionals as needed.
“When you can test early, and if you find out that you have influenza, there is an antiviral that we use to treat that, will help reduce your chance of complications,” said the University of Kansas Medical Center’s Dana Hawkinson in an interview with KSHB-TV.
Back in the darkest days of the pandemic, many of us hoped for more.
Back then, folks who care about the well-being of other Kansans imagined that we might begin a new era, one in which officials supported public health and reliable science. Millions of lives could be saved over the years as we prioritized vaccinations and looked out for one another.
Instead, antiscience and antisocial ideologues exploited public fear for personal gain. They promoted snake oil cures instead of actual medicine. They spread conspiracy theories about lifesaving vaccines. They promoted the fallacious idea that individual liberty meant the right to infect and kill your loved ones.
They got the better of the argument. Scientists and politicians too often stumbled in those fast-moving early days, opening the door for Kennedy and his fellow charlatans to prance through merrily.
Now we all pay for that freedom. Those 5,000 Americans and nine children have paid for our right to cough in public, to turn up our noses at shots, to vote for a would-be autocrat who gives the best medical care to his friends while tossing millions off Medicaid. I’m sure they would all eagerly support that bargain if they could speak to us now.
Again, I digress. But not really.
Let this flu season serve as a reminder that respiratory viruses crash the party every winter, whether you acknowledge them or not. When a particularly virulent variant comes to town, it doesn’t care how tough you act or how much you hate doctors and nurses.
It will lay you out flat and make you beg for mercy.

Steny Hoyer (D-5th), backed by Democratic members of the state's congressional delegation, speaks at a January 2025 news conference in the State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) will announce Thursday that he will not seek reelection this fall, capping a 60-year career in state and federal politics that saw him become a legendary figure in Maryland politics and the second-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House.
Hoyer’s office Wednesday night confirmed the news, first reported by Politico, that the congressman’s 22nd term in Congress will be his last, and that he would announce it on the House floor at 10 a.m. Thursday. Hoyer posted a simple statement on social media Wednesday night, saying only that he will speak on the House floor at that time.
Hoyer’s departure could open up a free-for-all among state Democrats who are now free to run for a seat that was considered Hoyer’s, a well-funded, well-liked and well-connected incumbent who proved impossible to unseat by the few Democrats, and decades of Republicans, who tried.
Some of the Democrats whose names have been mentioned as possible contenders for the now-open 5th District seat include Dels. Adrian Boafo and Nicole Williams, both from Prince George’s County, and former Bowie Mayor Tim Adams. Former Del. Jazz Lewis, a Prince George’s Democrat who once served as Hoyer’s campaign manager, was long considered a possible replacement, but his recent decision to step down from the legislature for a job as a lobbyist for the University of Maryland has put that in doubt.
In a brief interview Wednesday night, Williams said she’s giving “strong consideration” to seeking the seat. After confirmation was made that Hoyer would not seek reelection, Williams said she received text messages and phone calls from individuals throughout the state.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I’m really flattered that people have seen the work that I have done over the years as an elected official, even before I was even serving as a state delegate,” she said. “I do have to think seriously about whether I’m going to formally put my name before the voters of the 5th Congressional District for consideration.”
But she stressed Wednesday it’s all about Hoyer and his legacy for now.
“First and foremost, I just want to thank Congressman Hoyer for all of his years of service to Prince George’s County, to the 5th Congressional District, to the state of Maryland and really to the nation,” she said. “He is going to leave big shoes for us to fill. This is big news for our state and our nation. I’m just happy to be a witness and a part of it. I have literally seen what he has done for the residents of the 5th Congressional District.”
According to the Maryland State Board of Elections, five Democrats had filed already — some as early as last March — to run for the seat that includes the three Southern Maryland counties of Charles, Calvert and St. Mary’s as well as portions of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties.
The will-he-or-won’t-he game has become a biennial exercise for Democrats as Hoyer aged. He will be 87 by the time of the fall election, but appears fit and capable and has been coy when asked directly in recent months, replying with variations of “we haven’t made a decision.” He even danced at his annual bull roast in June.
Hoyer, elected to the U.S. House in 1981, is currently the third-longest serving member of the chamber. He served as the No. 2 Democrat behind Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat with Baltimore roots, from 2007 to 2023, when both Pelosi and Hoyer said they would step down from their leadership posts to make way for a younger generation of Democratic leaders.
But Hoyer’s career in politics began long before he was elected to Congress, when he served from 1962 to 1966 as a staffer in the office of U.S. Sen. Daniel Brewster (D-Md.) — where one of his fellow staffers was Pelosi, the daughter Baltimore Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. and sister of Thomas D’Alesandro III, who also served as mayor.
Lewis wraps legislative career to lobby for University of Maryland

Hoyer won a seat in the Maryland Senate in 1966 at the age of 27, and became the body’s youngest president in 1975. He lost a primary bid for  lieutenant governor in 1978, as the running mate of then-Acting Gov. Blair Lee III. But Hoyer made his political comeback in 1981 when he won a special election to replace Rep. Gladys Noon Spellman (D), who became incapacitated after suffering a heart attack and subsequently lapsed into a coma.
He’s held the seat ever since. The 5th District then was largely a suburban Prince George’s County district when Hoyer first won it, but it was redrawn after the 1990 Census to include all of Southern Maryland. Still, Hoyer has rarely faced a significant challenge in either configuration of the district.
In the House, he was seen as a moderate counterbalance to the more-liberal Pelosi.
Hoyer’s years of service on the Appropriations Committee — which he returned to after stepping down from leadership — allowed him to look out for his district in terms of funding.
His years of service also made his endorsement a valuable one for Democrats in the state and in Prince George’s County, where a research facility at National Archives II is named for him.
His tenure has also allowed him to foster the careers of many rising Democrats — including freshman Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), who was an intern in his office — some of whom are expected to be in the hunt to replace him now that he’s leaving.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0581-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 01:56:29.997427

(Photo courtesy of Kim Rexroat)This is such an exciting time of year for us Florida columnists! The 2026 legislative session begins next Tuesday, and we’re all waiting to see which piece of legislation will win the coveted title of the Worst Bill of the Year. I’ve already chosen my nominee.
There are sooooo many possibilities. There’s a bill to block the removal of Confederate monuments, because nobody deserves honor more than traitors who took up arms against the United States. I assume we’ll soon begin building monuments to the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, too.
Another bill would require teachers to take loyalty oaths, because it’s always a great idea to copy Sen. Joe McCarthy. In fact, why not require teachers to swear their loyalty to Mr. Red Scare, too?
There’s also a bill that would ban the display of Pride flags at any government office in the allegedly “Free” State of Florida. Sorry, “freedom” is available only to people who vote the government-approved way.
But my pick for the worst of the worst is House Bill 479. This bill would ban cities and counties from imposing “laws, regulations, rules, or policies” to protect wetlands and prevent water pollution.

Gil Smart via VoteWater
How bad is it? “The impacts of it are incredibly broad,” said Matt Singer of the Florida League of Cities. “This is a world-ender.”
Local government needs to be involved in regulating these water and wetland issues because they’re better able to tailor their actions to fit local circumstances, said Gil Smart of VoteWater.org.
“This bill would just blow that up,” Smart told me.
Cragin Mosteller via Florida Association of Counties
The bill is titled “Land and Water Management,” but I think that’s misleading. In the interest of accuracy, it should be called “Lack of Any Land and Water Management.”
Cragin Mosteller of the Florida Association of Counties suggested an even better name: the “I Hate Water Bill.”
Do expect pollution
Mosteller pointed out that clean water “is very important to our quality of life in Florida. It should be protected.”
Instead, this bill orders local governments to leave the job of controlling pollution and saving wetlands to a state agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Pro –  HA HA HA HA HA!
Sorry, I can never get through that word “Protection” without cracking up.
Why do I react that way to the DEP? Because this is the agency that’s been dragging its feet since 2017 on cleaning up the state’s outstanding springs, despite clear orders from the Legislature.
Florida is ranked No. 1 in the U.S for polluted lakes — in fact, our largest, Lake Okeechobee, has been named the most polluted lake in the nation. Florida’s longest river, the St. Johns, is coping with steadily increasing pollution from septic waste.
Perhaps most telling of all is what happened when a pollution-fueled algae bloom killed off so much seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon that 2,000 manatees starved to death. A federal judge ruled that by failing to stop the pollution, the DEP had violated the Endangered Species Act.
As for wetlands, Florida developers tried for years to get the DEP to be put in charge of issuing federal wetland permits. They finally got their wish at the tail end of the first Trump administration, when the feds handed over their authority to the DEP.
Four years later, a federal judge ruled the DEP was so intent on cranking out wetlands destruction permits as fast as possible that it had done an illegal end run around the Endangered Species Act. The decision is being appealed, but his ruling calling out the DEP for failing to protect manatees is hard to ignore.
In other words, in Florida the initials “DEP” actually stand for “Do Expect Pollution.”
Passing this bill to put every bit of wetlands and pollution protection in the hands of the DEP would be about as smart as assigning the Cookie Monster to guard the Publix bakery.
The nest and the nephew

“This bill doesn’t make any sense,” Kim Dinkins of the smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida told me. “We stand to lose a lot more than we might gain if it passes.”
But the bill makes perfect sense if you know its origin story.
HB 479 is sponsored by Rep. Randy Maggard, who comes from a politically well-connected family in Pasco County. His brother is a business partner of state Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and is married to the sister of a Pasco commissioner.
I mention this because this new bill is nearly identical to one that Maggard filed in 2023 after his nephew, Zach Maggard, had a problem with Pasco County.
State Rep. Randy Maggard vis Florida House
Zach Maggard via LinkedIn
Soon after Zach Maggard bought a lot in a subdivision called Lake Jovita Golf & Country Club, his neighbors noticed something disturbing. As I reported at the time, a large eagle nest on that property, one that had been there for 27 years, suddenly disappeared — and no, it wasn’t knocked down by a storm. The tree was still there, but there was no trace of the nest.
Upset neighbors and outraged bird advocates called officials from Pasco County, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to figure out who illegally destroyed the nest.
The investigators were unable to pin the crime on anyone, but they noticed that the wetlands shown on Zach Maggard’s building plans did not match the wetlands on the ground.
A county building official ordered a new wetlands map and further scrutinized the situation. The big fight turned out to be over a 12-foot “walkway” down to the lake — one that clearly wasn’t going to be a walkway but a concrete driveway for a boat ramp.
The Pasco building official suggested making the “walkway” out of some permeable material, so water could continue to flow through it. Zach Maggard didn’t like the idea. 
I was told that Maggard went over the building official’s head. The project got approved — although not by the building official who’d actually been on the scene.
The bottom line: Rep. Maggard told me in 2023 that he filed this bill because his nephew did some things that Pasco officials objected to, yet paid no penalty for them. He seemed intent on punishing the regulators for trying to interfere with his nephew’s plans.
Maggard’s original bill crashed and burned, and the eagles rebuilt their Lake Jovita nest.
“This beautiful eagle pair is currently raising two very young eaglets,” Kim Rexroat, Audubon Florida’s eagle watch coordinator for Pasco, told me this week.
Maggard’s awful bill is back too, just like a bad penny.
The sponsor
I tried several times to talk to Rep. Maggard about him filing the worst bill of the 2026 session. Alas, he never called me back. Perhaps he was too busy dancing in delight after hearing about his nomination for Worst Bill.
But he did acknowledge to me in 2023 about how he had turned the Lake Jovita situation involving his nephew into a legislative attack on all 67 counties and 400 or so cities across the state.
That interview lingers in my memory as both the funniest and most painful conversation (I actually bit my tongue) I’ve ever had with a Florida politician.
At first, our discussion was confusing. Rep. Maggard kept saying the word “duplicitous” but after a while I figured out he was using it to mean something other than “deceptive.” When I finally asked him if he meant people were lying about his bill, he said no.
“To me, ‘duplicitous’ means you’re duplicating something,” he said, explaining he thought all the local water and wetland regulations were just duplicates of the state ones (they’re not).
Maggard also told me he was in favor of protecting our clean water from pollution, but “why do the customers, the consumers, the citizens have to go through all these hurdles?” He didn’t see the role that regulation plays in preventing pollution from tainting our water supply.
And now he’s trying to end all the non-DEP regulations.
Sprawl on steroids
Rep. Maggard is far from alone in this ill-considered pursuit.
Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
There’s a companion bill in the other chamber, SB 718, just as there was in 2023. The 2023 bill was sponsored by Sen. Danny Burgess, whose law partner iswas another of Maggard’s nephews. This year, the Senate version of the bill this year is sponsored by Ocala’s Sen. Stan McClain.
If that name sounds familiar, it’s because he’s behind quite a few pro-development bills. One is the bill creating “Blue Ribbon” developments that don’t have to obey local zoning rules or pay attention to what the public wants.
Smart of the VoteWater organization suggested that that’s why McCain is supporting Maggard’s bill, too. By shutting local governments out of water pollution and wetlands regulation, he said, the public gets silenced as well. The DEP rarely holds public hearings on individual permits.
“A lot of this is to cut the public out of the process,” Smart said.
McClain, by the way, happens to be a homebuilder in Marion County. In fact, his legislative website says he’s executive officer of the Marion County Building Industry Association.
Environmental advocates dubbed the legislative session a couple of years back as “The Year of Sprawl.” Thanks to McClain, Smart said, “This is the Year of Sprawl on Steroids.”
Drink up
The Legislature has spent a lot of energy over the past few years trying to handcuff local governments to prevent them from doing things that upset major campaign contrib– er, I mean, fine, upstanding citizens who just happen to sit on very big wallets.
But this goes beyond that. This is a bill designed to let polluters run amok, even if the result threatens all our health.
If anyone tries to resist, Maggard’s bill contains a strong penalty to stop them. If any city or county persists in trying to protect its citizens from pollution, the DEP is ordered to notify the state’s chief financial officer. 
Then, per the bill, the CFO is supposed to withhold state funds from those local governments, effectively killing their ability to pay for police, fire departments, solid waste, libraries, and so forth.
Both have been referred to not one, not two, but THREE committees.
Perhaps, as happened in 2023, the process of wading through multiple committees will slow them down too much to pass.
I’d like to make sure Rep. Maggard really understands the importance of Florida water quality.
Here’s my plan: We hire a fancy calligrapher to draft a lovely invitation to notify Rep. Maggard that he’s been chosen for a major award.
We invite him to the Worst Bill awards ceremony at the Governor’s Inn in Tallahassee, which I hear is quite the hot venue for political shindigs in our state capital.
Then, when Rep. Maggard shows up, ready to accept his award, we hand him a large glass of ugly, nasty, polluted water and say, “You made that. It’s yours. Now drink it all.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lake-Jovita-eagle-1-by-Kim-Rexroat-1024x819.jpg,,,2026-01-08 00:11:45.056421
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT must invest in better rehabilitation,Caitlin Doherty,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/ct-must-invest-in-better-rehabilitation/,Connecticut spends millions of dollars on reincarcerating people. Yet it already has a solution to the problem within its own system.,"Some 50% of people who are incarcerated in Connecticut are back in prison within three years of release. 
People reentering their communities after being in prison often struggle. They have difficulties being hired, finding housing, and receiving the support that they need. Without stability, they fall back into the circumstances that led them to being incarcerated initially, and they are then rearrested. 
The cycle of recidivism cannot be blamed on the people caught within this system. Rather, we as taxpayers and voters must realize the prison system that we fund and enable is not fulfilling its supposed purpose. 



The CT Department of Correction’s stated mission is “to be a leader in progressive correctional practices and partnered re-entry initiatives to support responsive evidence-based practices geared toward supporting reintegration and reducing recidivism under the Department’s supervision.” Yet the state of Connecticut has one of the highest recidivism rates nationally. As community members, voters, and taxpayers, we have a duty to demand better of our state’s Department of Corrections so that people who are incarcerated will not be stuck in a lifelong cycle of recidivism. 
Fortunately, we already have a blueprint of how to do this.
Established in 2017, the T.R.U.E. (Truthfulness, Respectfulness, Understanding, and Elevating) unitat Cheshire Correctional Institution offers a potential pathway to lower recidivism. Modelled after the German prison system, this program pairs 18-25 year-olds serving shorter sentences with older mentors serving life sentences to help the younger men prepare to reenter their communities. Both mentors and mentees voluntarily apply to participate in the program, and mentors complete training in therapeutic practices before they are partnered with a mentee. 
They live in a unit of the prison together with specially trained correctional officers. Every morning, participants check in with each other about their goals for the day, and mentors have conversations with the younger men about the difficult realities they will face in reentering their communities. They have access to a library, a barber shop, and a room with chalkboards to share ideas and concerns. They also participate in classes and workshops on anything from slam poetry to crafting a resume and preparing for job interviews. Participants are given mock salaries, pay mock taxes and rent, and are fined if they violate a rule. 
In short, they actively work toward their successful reentry into society.

The mentoring relationship between the younger and older participants centers on healing, discipline, accountability, and growth. “The important thing about this program is we try and hold them accountable for everything they do,’” said one mentor in the program in an interview with the Council of State Governments Justice Center. Mentors and mentees work together to build emotional skills and plan for reentry to break the cycle of recidivism. 
Voters and policymakers need to prioritize expanding this model to other prisons throughout the state, so that others might benefit from this programming in the same ways T.R.U.E. participants have.
In T.R.U.E., interactions between participants and correctional officers are much less punitive than in the prison population more generally. Some may think that correctional officers would not want to participate in this program because it is different and less punitive than their normal approach. However, staff at Cheshire were excited to participate in this program. According to an interview with Scott Semple, a former Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Corrections, over 100 staff members applied to work on the T.R.U.E. unit. 
Instead of sending someone to solitary confinement or taking away their commissary access, correctional officers who notice that a participant has violated a rule will bring this to the mentors. Often, there will be a group discussion between participants about how to address the violation and what consequence the person should have, which might include extra chores or paying a fine.
The impact of the T.R.U.E. program is evident. Only 21% of mentees have returned to prison,which is a steep drop from the state’s general reincarceration rate of 50%. Although the program has been successful since it was founded, Connecticut has not expanded this model to many of its other prisons across the state. Thus far, only one other prison, the York Correctional Institution for women, has adopted a similar program. 
Funding has been a significant barrier that prevents the broader expansion of the T.R.U.E. model. However, investing in expanding the program would lower the overall costs of incarceration considerably. There are significant costs associated with reincarcerating 50% of those released from prison within three years. The Council of State Governments Justice Center calculated that Connecticut spent over $100 million on reincarcerating people in 2022. T.R.U.E. reduces reincarceration from 50% to 20%, and adopting these types of units more widely in the state would help cut the high costs of continually reincarcerating people.
The model of the T.R.U .E. program offers a promising pathway to reduce the issue of recidivism in our state. In an interview, one T.R.U.E. mentor reflected on how he would convince skeptics that this program is worthwhile, saying “I would ask those people in society to please try to walk in someone’s shoes who watched their father get killed, who watched their brother get killed, who watched their mother do drugs. And think, what type of person would that child grow up to be?” He emphasized the T.R.U.E. program’s focus on accountability and discipline, saying “I’m not asking you to start paying taxpayer dollars to give people the world. Let them earn it. But see if it [programs like T.R.U.E.] works. We’ve tried everything else, haven’t we?”

Piscitelli,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/we-must-reclaim-the-values-of-the-greatest-generation/,Immigrants have always been part of America's renewal. To vilify them is to forget our own origin story.,"When we encounter challenging periods in the nation, we often refer to the Greatest Generation. Coined by Tom Brokaw, the “Greatest Generation,” is defined by those who survived the Great Depression, defeated fascism overseas, and went on to build a stable and prosperous country. 
Yet for all our references to their sacrifice and character, we have forgotten many of the values that made their era one of resilience and unity rather than division. Today, our politics are more toxic. As immigrant communities are increasingly targeted by a heartless administration, we would do well to remember the lessons of the Greatest Generation.
They faced hardship together rather than targeting the easiest group to blame. Their instinct was not to divide but to organize. On the other hand, the political rhetoric of the current administration, especially when they label immigrants as unwelcomed or existential threats, runs counter to the spirit of the ideals we held sacred. Fear-based messaging may win short-term political points, but it erodes the long-term cohesion a democracy needs to thrive.
America in the 1940s and 50’s was far from perfect; far from inclusive, yet they still recognized that strength came from a sense of something larger than themselves. Our ancestors fought alongside immigrants and the children of immigrants. They believed in building a country expansive enough to hold many identities. Today, we should be expanding that tradition, not shrinking it through suspicion, fear, and resentment.
Members of the Greatest Generation didn’t pretend to agree on everything. They had political divisions, but they placed civic responsibility above political tribalism. They accepted that this country is a work in progress, renewed by each generation’s willingness to improve it. Immigrants have always been part of that renewal. To vilify them is to forget our own origin story.
My grandfather, the son of Italian immigrants, served with the 12th Armored Division, 17th Armored Infantry Battalion, Company C in the European Theater. He was awarded the Purple Heart for giving his life to defeat fascism and to defend freedom. To truly honor the nearly 407,000 Americans who gave their lives in World War II, the more than 16 million who served, including over 350,000 women in uniform, and the six million-plus women who powered the nation’s workforce, we must reclaim the values they embodied: courage without cruelty, patriotism without exclusion, and determination without resentment.
Compare that with today’s climate, where partisan loyalty often triumphs over the common good, and where inflammatory narratives, often directed at the most vulnerable, replace honest policy debate. We cannot solve real problems with an administration preoccupied with imaginary enemies. We must reject politics that thrive on fear; whether aimed at immigrants, political opponents, or our own neighbors, and choosing instead to build a country as confident and generous as the one our parents, grandparents and great grandparents imagined.
In Truman’s broadcast to the Armed Forces on April 17, 1945, he said: “Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifices. Because of these sacrifices, the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon.”
When you look to the horizon, remember what the greatest bestowed upon us: a nation survives not by hardening its heart, but by widening its circle. That is the America they fought for. It can still be the America we build if we so choose.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The deadly shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE officer Wednesday is the ninth shooting by an immigration officer in just the past fourth months, and all of them involved firing at people in vehicles, according to a New York Times report. 
Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approaching a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver, 37-year-old Renee Good, to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. Good then slowly backs up and then pulls forward, appearing to try to leave. An officer at the front of the vehicle fires three shots and the SUV travels a short distance before crashing into a parked car.
The deadly incident comes just days after the Trump administration began a massive deployment of 2,000 immigration enforcement officers to Minnesota, ramping up an immigration crackdown that has already caused massive disturbances in Minnesota’s immigrant communities — including the Somali Minnesotan community that is almost entirely citizens and legal residents.
In each of the recent ICE shootings, the government has claimed the officer was acting in self-defense.
Other reporting shows, however, that law enforcement experts have long warned against shooting into cars, and most of the nation’s major cities have banned the practice.

Brown/Maryland Matters)Behavioral health advocates have ambitious priorities for the 2026 General Assembly that include improving the major shortage of behavioral health professionals, advocating for affordable housing options and protecting funds that support the behavioral health network.
But pushing those priorities may be a challenge as legislators grapple with a projected $1.6 billion budget deficit, with higher-than-anticipated use of behavioral health services under Medicaid considered a key driver in the shortfall, according to state analysts.
“That will be key during session, and central to any policy considerations, especially as we’re thinking about asking for increases. Especially as we’re looking at new initiatives,” Adrienne Breidenstine with the Behavioral Health System Baltimore said during a virtual discussion Wednesday.
“This budget gap means that were going to have to be navigating that,” she said.
In November, state analysts told lawmakers that the fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal 2027 fiscal year was “quite a bit worse” than what was predicted at the end of the previous legislative session. That’s partially because of funding changes from the Trump administration and the budget reconciliation bill HR 1, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Lawmakers cautioned on use of reserves to solve nearly $1.5 billion deficit

But another reason is that the state has spent about $778 million more than analysts forecast over the current fiscal year, with Medicaid behavioral health services contributing $217 million of that overspending.
In November, Department of Legislative Services Budget Analyst David Romans highlighted Medicaid spending on behavioral health as one of the “big items” contributing to higher-than-anticipated spending over fiscal 2026.
“We’ve seen over the last couple of years a fairly dramatic jump in utilization of behavioral health services by adults enrolled in Medicaid,” he said during a virtual Joint Spending Affordability Committee hearing in November. “I don’t know if we have a complete answer as to why that is.”
But Breidenstine stressed that overspending is “not necessarily a bad thing,” since it means that people who need behavioral health resources are getting them.
“There was a larger than anticipated services utilization of Medicaid services,” she said Wednesday. “Not necessarily a bad thing — it shows that people need care and they’re getting access. It just means that the state didn’t anticipate all of that need.”
In the 2025 session, Gov. Wes Moore (D) proposed cutting around $116 million from various behavioral health programs as the state worked to close a $3 billion budget shortfall it faced then. Advocates like Breidenstine mobilized against those cuts, and lawmakers were able to restore most of that funding.
But solving the upcoming budget deficit will be a key challenge for the 2026 General Assembly session that starts next week, aggravated by the fact that it’s an election year and there is little appetite for raising taxes. Several officials have said the budget may require tightening spending on state programs.
Meanwhile, advocates still want to push other initiatives during the upcoming session that they say are crucial in helping people get behavioral health services they need, which could require additional state funds to accomplish.
Dan Rabbitt of Behavioral Health System Baltimore said one of the organization’s newest priorities is to push for affordable housing options, especially as the Trump administration pulls federal funding to support what’s called permanent supportive housing.
Housing officials, advocates warn shift in HUD funding could unhouse thousands in Maryland

“We’ve also seen a lot of threats coming in from the federal government around permanent supportive housing,” he said. “The current federal administration doesn’t seem to believe in that model. And so, increasing and protecting affordable housing is going to be a priority of ours in the next two years.”
People facing chronic homelessness often struggle with mental health needs and drug addiction. Advocates say that permanent housing programs may address those challenges by pairing housing assistance with connections to mental health services and other resources.
Rabbitt also said that advocates will be pushing lawmakers to help solve the 34,000 behavioral health professional shortage in the state, which is forecasted to only get worse if no action is taken, according to a 2023 report. Ideally, that would involve improving reimbursement rates for providers of mental and behavioral health services, which would require additional state funds.
But advocates are not deterred by those challenges, and hope to work with lawmakers to boost behavioral health services during the 2026 session.
“We advocates have been here before, we know what’s ahead of us to work together to address these issues,” Breidenstine said.

(CDC map)A child from Louisiana has died from seasonal influenza, according to a state official’s confirmation of a weekly report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
No additional information was provided on the fatal pediatric case, including the date of death, the location or age of the child. Louisiana has reported five deaths related to the flu for the 2025-26 season, with the previous four cases involving adults. 
Louisiana is among 48 states with levels of flu cases the CDC has deemed “very high.” For the current flu season, the agency has estimates there have been 11 million flu cases, 120,000 related hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths attributed to the virus. 
Though the seasonal flu vaccine has turned out to be a poor match for the current prevalent influenza strain, A(H3N2), physicians still recommend obtaining the shot because it can reduce symptoms for those who contract the virus.
For the past two years, former state surgeon general Dr. Ralph Abraham has declined to promote the flu vaccine in Louisiana or have the state health department host events where the vaccine is made available. Abraham now holds the No. 2 position at the Centers for Disease Control.
Abraham followed the lead of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in crafting policy that requires patients to consult with a doctor before receiving the flu vaccine, moving away from having the shots readily available at health clinics and pharmacies. 
“Maybe that’s a better thing,” Kennedy told CBS News in an interview Wednesday when told fewer people are likely to receive a flu vaccine. He cited research that claims the flu vaccine hasn’t prevented serious illness among children. 
Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control removed the vaccines for flu, COVID, rotavirus, meningitis, and hepatitis A and B from the recommended vaccination schedule for children. However, the CDC recommends that 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine in its weekly flu surveillance update.
Flu cases have historically increased in the early weeks of winter following the holiday season, and CDC data show that trend holding firm to start 2026. National numbers for the final week of December showed patients ages 5 to 17 accounted for the largest share of emergency department flu diagnoses at 21%, followed by newborns to 4-year-olds at 18%. Case numbers were on the rise across all age ranges. 
More than 7% of roughly 3,500 emergency room visits in Louisiana for the week ending Dec. 13 were related to the flu, according to state health department data. Children ages 5 to 11 accounted for nearly 25% of those visits, followed by 2- to 4-year-olds (23%), ages 12 to 17 (15%), newborn  to 1-year-olds (15%), adults 18 to 64 (5%) and patients 65 and older (2%).
Flu vaccine rates generally are highest among senior citizens, followed by younger adults.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)To get in top shape for the 2034 Winter Games, state officials say the drying Great Salt Lake needs enough additional water each year to fill 400,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools – about one for every household in Salt Lake County. 
They acknowledge the goal is ambitious and say they hope to seize on greater public awareness and a mix of government and outside investment to help restore the lake. 



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


“Yes, our choices do matter when it comes to this lake, and those choices can actually increase recovery, and the speed of recovery,” Brian Steed, Utah’s Great Salt Lake commissioner, said Wednesday at an event focused on the lake’s long-term health and hosted by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
Steed and other members of the state’s “Great Salt Lake strike team” — a group of experts, state officials and others — released a report Wednesday highlighting recent milestones, data on water use and measures that may help. 
The lake has shrunk after years of drought, climate change and redirection of water for farming and other uses, reaching a record low in 2022. It made some recovery before dropping back down to end 2025 at its third-lowest level since 1903. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water from the Great Salt Lake Basin, at 65%, the report says, followed by municipal and industrial uses at 26.8% and mineral extraction at 5.7%. 
The planned 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake City will draw greater attention to the lake’s health, noted Natalie Gochnour, director of the Gardner Institute. 
“We know that in 2034, the world’s eyes are going to be on this state. And we’ve made this commitment, we’ve signed this charter for the lake, to commit ourselves to be the place that rescues an inland sea,” Gochnour said. 
The state is receiving outside help to recover the lake, with $50 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water in the West, $100 million from conservation nonprofit Ducks Unlimited, and another commitment for $100 million from a philanthropic campaign, Great Salt Lake Rising, the report notes. 
Timothy Hawkes with the Great Salt Lake Brine Shrimp Cooperative told Utah News Dispatch he felt encouraged by the increase in funding and public awareness. But he said a key question remains: “How are you actually going to get that much water to the lake?”
Hawkes said the process to answer that question “is complicated, it’s difficult, it’s slow, and that’s frustrating for advocates and everybody that cares about the lake.”

Kevin Perry, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, said the state is installing more air quality monitors and has a new plan to track how frequent, severe and harmful dust storms are when they kick up toxins from the dry lakebed.  
“I was super excited about this, because this is the first time that the state has really taken the dust issue seriously,” said Perry, a member of the strike team. 
The team’s new report points to successes. Conservation measures over the last 25 years have increased annual average inflow to the lake by 1,665 acre feet — or more than 830 Olympic pools. 
That number is significant, and likely to grow, said Anna McEntire, managing director of Utah State University’s Janet Quinney Lawson Institute for Land, Water and Air. 
“I’m really confident this is a case of increasing returns,” McEntire told Utah News Dispatch. 
In terms of household water use, the vast majority goes outside to lawns and gardens, rather than inside for cooking and showering. The data shows that reducing overall outside use could go far in conserving more water, McEntire said. 
Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, called 2026 a “watershed year.” He said he’s working with lawmakers and the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food to improve and expand a program that has begun paying farmers for water they don’t use when they fallow their fields for a time. 
“We’re going to see big movement on water use,” Ferry promised during a panel discussion at Wednesday’s event.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Thousands of people on Wednesday evening filled Portland Avenue near 34th Street in south Minneapolis, where just hours earlier an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her car.   
Candles, flowers and whistles filled the patch of snow where Good’s car crashed after she was shot. 
Good’s death has already become a rallying cry for the people working to disrupt President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which entails heavily armed, masked federal officers roaming the streets of select cities, including Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago,  New Orleans and Memphis, Tennessee.
“No Trump, no troops, Twin Cities ain’t licking boots,” the crowd chanted. Several speakers called for the prosecution of the agent who shot Good.
Carly Morford, of northeast Minneapolis, said she was moved to come to the vigil after seeing a video of the killing and was appalled the Trump administration labeled Good a “domestic terrorist.”
“I’m not going to sit by while my fellow Minnesotans are shot and killed,” Morford said. “And so even though I’m just one person and it’s not going to do anything, a bunch of people coming out is.”

The killing has also reopened wounds from the 2020 Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd less than a mile away, which ignited widespread protests and riots in the city at the time, and a national reckoning over racism and police violence.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday that Good “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.”
Video provided to the Reformer shows an officer positioning himself in front of the vehicle and firing three shots through the windshield as Good attempted to turn the car away from the officer.

“For them to sit there and lie, and try to paint a false narrative about Renee, is exactly what they have done for police abuse victims year after year after year,” said attorney and civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong. 
Dani Replogle handed out fliers with information on joining an ICE watch group called Defend 612, which coordinates patrols of city neighborhoods and conducts trainings on observing enforcement actions. 
She said she’s been patrolling the Powderhorn Park area where she lives for about a month and a half. She saw a raid during which a person was handcuffed and people showed up to record and provide advice.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Nebraska lawmakers consider possibly expelling a fellow lawmaker for the first time in state history, senators introduced more than 100 bills Wednesday, the first day of the 2026 legislative session.
The session will primarily focus on closing the state’s $471 million budget deficit, to which Gov. Jim Pillen will soon propose his answer. For now, lawmakers are introducing bills on different priorities, ranging from McCook and its new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center for migrants to gender transition care, youth sports and new license plates.


Jan. 7, 2026, introduced bills
See the full list of legislation introduced Wednesday.


Legislative Bill 752, introduced by State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, is an effort to ensure that state funding continues for reentry and reintegration programming for Nebraska inmates, despite the closure of the McCook Work Ethic Camp.
Under the Pillen administration’s direction, the Work Ethic Camp was recently converted to a holding facility for ICE. Inmates who had been in McCook before the conversion were relocated to other state prison facilities, paroled or released.

In the facility’s former life as a state prison, it had specialized in preparing low-risk male inmates for transition back to the community.
Spivey’s proposal calls for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services to make sure that mission continues for the relocated inmates and others, directing $5 million in general funds for fiscal year 2026-27 toward tuition, fees and other direct costs for reentry and reintegration programming for committed offenders.
“It’s a way to ensure that programming doesn’t get cut and that we’re still offering those services, because those men still need them,” Spivey said Tuesday.
The feds now reimburse the state for use of the McCook property, which remains owned and staffed by the state. Pillen’s team has estimated the state-federal deal will net Nebraska $14.25 million. The Work Ethic Camp previously cost about $10.2 million in taxpayer dollars each year to operate.

State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, as promised, again seeks to define school and state agency restrooms as “male” or “female,” based on 2025 definitions Kauth put in state law. The new bill, LB 730, is identical to the half of Kauth’s 2025 law that she had to carve out to unify her Republican colleagues and pass it with the minimum support needed to overcome a filibuster.
The legislation includes some exceptions, such as for emergencies, cleaning or for parents or caregivers of children or individuals with a disability of different sexes. Single-occupancy bathrooms would be allowed. Schools or universities would decide how to enforce the measure.
Last year, lawmakers also restricted student-athletes in K-12 schools and colleges to interscholastic sports matching their sex at birth, unless coed.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who supported Kauth’s narrowed 2025 bill but refused to back the bathroom changes, refused to endorse what he termed the “Nebraska State Potty Patrol.” Riepe, a former hospital administrator, reiterated Wednesday that he still worries about enforcement.
Kauth said she reached out to Riepe to address his concerns, including those he voiced on a radio show in November. She said he did not return her call. Riepe said Wednesday he remains opposed, jeopardizing Kauth’s path to 33 votes.
“If you can’t enforce it, you better get it off the books, or it’ll come back and bite you legally someplace,” Riepe said.

Kauth this year also seeks to fully outlaw prescribing cross-sex hormones or puberty blockers to youths experiencing gender dysphoria beginning next year, via LB 732. The bill would also prohibit gender care for Nebraska minors via out-of-state telehealth.
The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office would be empowered to enforce the act within 20 years of a violation. That would include each prescription of puberty blockers or hormones for gender transition.
A 2023 Kauth bill strictly regulated the medicine for transgender youths, as dictated by the state’s chief medical officer. It banned gender transition surgeries in the state.
LB 731, also from Kauth, would expand the window in which Nebraskans who are recommended or prescribed gender transition care but want to later sue for injury or damages to within 12 years after the last date of care.
“As the adults, we are supposed to help kids with what they need and help them through whatever difficulties they’re having, but that does not mean cutting of their body parts or putting completely altering drugs in their systems,” Kauth said.
Riepe said he would need to review the new bills but that he’s a bit “live and let live.”
“I can’t live somebody else’s life, and, quite frankly, it’s above my pay grade, by a long ways,” Riepe said. “I’m not really enthusiastic about trying to make life more difficult for any group of people.”

Michelle Jud, a founder of the nonprofit Rainbow Parents of Nebraska, a group of parents statewide whose children are LGBTQ, said parents have become “numb” to the repeated fights. She said advocates had expected the bathroom bill to be reintroduced but not the others.
“Once you’ve been stabbed in the back, it’s like twisting the knife,” Jud said. “Let’s just see what more harmful things we can do.”
Jud asked why politicians think they can better handle their children’s needs than their counselors, doctors or parents. She said Rainbow Parents see their kids as a “gift.”
“We just wish that everybody could see that they’re more than just a trans person,” Jud said. “They’re not just a demographic to come after. They’re human beings with amazing talents and perspectives.”
Separately, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha introduced LB 742, which seeks to allow certain seventh and eighth-graders to participate in high school sports with the sign-off of the appropriate coach or athletic director, health care professional and parent.
McKinney said it’s important for youth development and a shift in the view of Nebraska athletes.
“I think it starts with developing them at a younger age and making sure they are prepared, so we start seeing in-state kids going to our state schools,” McKinney said.
Among other notable proposals introduced Wednesday:

LB 733, by State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston — Change the name of the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to the Division of Disability and Aging within DHHS.
LB 738, by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, and LB 769, by State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara — Establish new custom license plates honoring women veterans (LB 738) and the University of Nebraska State Museum (LB 769).
LB 745, by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha — Eliminate certain requirements for obtaining a diploma of high school equivalency, including that the individual must be at least 18, and have withdrawn from school for at least one year.
LB 751, by State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha — Require the Nebraska State Patrol, in partnership with the Commission on African American Affairs, to conduct a study on missing Black women and children in the state. The findings could lead to legislation and state resources to improve reporting and identification of those missing. 
LB 762, by State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln; LB 780, by Dungan; and LB 805, by State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings — Require insurance coverage for pediatric autoimmune disorders (LB 762), eating disorders (LB 780) and infant cranial helmets (LB 805). 
LB 734, by State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha — Restore previous work requirement exemptions for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. Nebraska changed its requirements after Congress passed the federal tax and spending law President Donald Trump sought.
LB 791, by State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln — Restrict annual campaign contributions to candidates or ballot measures to no more than $3,500, beginning Jan. 1, 2027. The rate would be adjusted for inflation every two years.
LB 809, by State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk — Prevent cities and political subdivisions from passing local laws that prohibit landlords from refusing to rent a privately-owned home based on the applicant’s source of income, including government assistance.
LB812, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln — Set state requirements for DHHS regarding Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and community engagement to match more lenient federal standards.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes) FRANKFORT — Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear gave his annual State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday evening, but Republican lawmakers largely weren’t there to hear it. 
In his seventh annual address and final budget proposal, Beshear urged Kentuckians and Americans to keep faith in the American Dream even as he said Republican President Donald Trump’s policies make it seem unattainable. 
“Today, too many American families feel this dream is just a hallucination. The costs of groceries and health care are too high. The family vacation they took as kids just doesn’t fit in the budget,” Beshear said. “That first home for a young couple is simply unaffordable – maybe unattainable. As leaders, we have a responsibility to reignite and refuel the American Dream. For the sake of future generations, it must burn bright in the minds of our people.” 
The governor’s address is typically given to a joint session of the General Assembly in the House chambers, but the Capitol is closed amid a multi-year renovation. Lawmakers began meeting in temporary chambers with limited public access this week as they begin a 60-day session which will decide the next two-year state budget.

Beshear, seen by some as a possible candidate for president in 2028, recalled words by LaRue County-born President Abraham Lincoln in his first inaugural address: “We are not enemies, but friends. … Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.”
“While the national media fixates on the rage, we focus on results. While social media lifts up the angry and judgmental, we must amplify kindness, acceptance and empathy,” Beshear told the crowd. “This polarized moment in our history won’t last forever. And, like Lincoln all those years ago, Kentucky can lead the way out of the darkness and into the light. It’s our job. It’s our duty. And we cannot leave a broken country to our children.”

Secretary of State Michael Adams was the lone GOP constitutional officer in the crowd. Speaking to reporters, Adams noted that the governor and the other officers have been sparring over executive branch budget cuts the governor has requested to cover revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal year.
“He’s an excellent speaker,” Adams said of Beshear. “Obviously, this speech was more about 2028 than 2026, but I respect that.”
The General Assembly’s top two Republicans — House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers — told reporters Wednesday afternoon before the 5:30 p.m. speech that they planned to not attend. 
“I’ll be in my office, watching it on TV,” Osborne said, adding that the address wouldn’t be given in the House chambers, but instead across town at the Kentucky Historical Society’s Thomas D. Clark Center. 
Osborne added that “because of the access issues and the limited number of people that we can accommodate in the temporary space, (Beshear) elected to do it over there.” He later added that the speech would be “poised as a budget address, but we know its political theater.” 
Scottie Ellis, spokesperson for Beshear, told the Lantern that the Beshear administration had spoken to legislative leadership “about where to hold the State of the Commonwealth Address, and it was recommended we plan an alternate location noting that the temporary chambers – designed by the LRC – do not have any form of seating for guests or media.”
“The Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History was selected based on its proximity to the Capitol and so that more people can attend,” she said. 
Osborne called it a “new version of normal in these temporary facilities.”
“Certainly, he could have done it here, but he chose not to, and so it will have the same impact,” he continued. “Hopefully, we will finally get to at least see some of the numbers that we’ve been asking for for months that have not been given to us.” 
In recent years, House Republicans have issued their budget ahead of Beshear’s proposals. However, it’s unlikely budget bills will be filed this week, Osborne said, as House members “haven’t gotten all the information that we needed despite multiple requests” made to the Beshear administration.

While it’s a tradition for Kentucky governors to deliver State of the Commonwealth addresses to joint sessions of the House and Senate, the Kentucky Constitution requires only that governors “from time to time, give to the General Assembly information of the state of the Commonwealth” and recommendations on expenditures.
‘American Dream’
In his address, Beshear reiterated budget proposals that he had discussed in an embargoed briefing with reporters earlier Wednesday. Among them, he is asking the GOP-controlled General Assembly to approve $500 million in one-time spending to ease families’ “rising cost pressures.” 
Beshear was critical of Trump’s policies, particularly the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or as the governor calls it, the “big, ugly bill. Beshear raised concerns about the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid and how it will impact Kentuckians who rely on the assistance program. Beshear said the law could close 35 rural Kentucky hospitals and eliminate coverage for 200,000 Kentuckians. 
The governor’s budget proposal calls for more money for health care access statewide, including $100 million to lower the cost of coverage on kynect, Kentucky’s Affordable Care Act health insurance exchange, and a $125 million rural hospital fund.

“The combination of these federal failures threatens the American Dream with lost jobs, higher costs, shorter lives and longer drives just to see the same doctor,” Beshear said. That’s why my budget pushes back, investing in our people and our health care. My budget fully funds Medicaid, even with the increasing cost.” 
Beshear defined the American Dream, a theme he revisited throughout the speech, as “ if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. You can build a better life. You can leave your kids better off.”

Beshear said his family has lived the American Dream, as his grandfather could not afford to go to college, but saved money and ultimately bought a local funeral home and supported his kids through college, including former Gov. Steve Beshear, the current governor’s father. 
The governor said several guests at the event embody the American Dream, including representatives from GE Appliances, which announced a multi-million dollar business investment in Kentucky last year, and General Matter, which leased federal land in Paducah for a new uranium enrichment facility. Throughout his speech, Beshear heralded economic development in the state during his time in office. 
Beshear named other guests in the crowd, like Dr. Jason Smith, the CEO of UofL Health, and added he hoped Smith would see the governor’s budget “as a reflection that Kentucky believes in you and we believe in health care for all of our people.” 
Toward the end of the speech, Beshear spoke about what he views as the most important choice for lawmakers this legislative session: funding for universal preschool statewide. Beshear has led a coalition to garner support for what he calls “Pre-K for All” leading up to the session. 
“To members of the General Assembly: We were able to work together on medical marijuana, to make sports betting legal, to protect horse racing and gaming and our horse industry,” Beshear said. “Surely, we can come together for 4-year-olds.” 
Beshear also had a message for those who want to make universal pre-K political. 
“Let me remind you: 4-year-olds can’t vote. They aren’t registered,” he said. “So if you’re against this because you think it gives me a win, what you’re really doing is handing these kids a loss.” 
Stivers and Osborne have typically held a joint press conference before or after the governor’s speech. This year, they opted to issue a statement after the speech, saying that the remarks were received and they were “hopeful they will include the data and information we have requested of his administration for the last several months.” 
“Kentucky is well positioned because of the sound, fiscally responsible policies enacted by Republican supermajorities — often overriding gubernatorial vetoes to do so,” the GOP leaders said. “These policies have produced a record budget reserve trust fund and allowed us to responsibly lower the state income tax. Our legislative focus will remain on protecting core investments, ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and avoiding commitments the Commonwealth cannot sustain. We will continue to prioritize measured growth, accountability, and long-term stability.”

While most Republican lawmakers stayed away from the speech Wednesday, some were among the crowd. 
Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, told reporters after the speech that Trump’s tariffs led to some of the economic developments Beshear touted, like Apple’s expansion of a glass manufacturing facility in Harrodsburg. Wheeler added that lawmakers should make sure rural hospitals are stable and have the ability to support their communities, and that would likely come up as lawmakers continue their budget session. 
As for universal pre-K, Wheeler did not think lawmakers would act on the governor’s request. 
“While I don’t think it’s a bad thing by any measure, clearly the cost has to be weighed with the benefit, and I don’t think that the benefit of that is probably something you won’t see the General Assembly act on this session,” Wheeler said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260107SOTC708-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 20:57:20.185358

Joe Lombardo discussing housing ""attainability"" legislation in April. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Legislative efforts to rein in corporate investors from purchasing excessive amounts of single family homes across Nevada has been consistently blocked by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
Republican President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he wants to see the industry regulated at the federal level, in an effort to tackle the housing and affordability crisis. 
“I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,” Trump wrote in a social media post Wednesday. “People live in homes, not corporations.”
Lombardo’s office didn’t respond to questions about the governor’s reaction to Trump’s announcement.
But in a statement issued late Wednesday, Lombardo said “while President Trump works to address corporate homeownership issues at the federal level, my administration continues to work on this complex issue at the state level.”
“Following the end of the 36th Special Session here in Nevada, we have been actively developing an interim stakeholder working group to develop a complete understanding of the issues surrounding corporate homeownership, and we’re working to identify consensus solutions we can quickly deploy in state to lower the cost of housing in Nevada.”
The existence of the “working group” had not been publicly announced prior to Trump’s social media post Wednesday.
Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal, who has backed bills in previous sessions to crack down on corporate homeownership, said in an email this was the first she had heard of Lombardo’s working group.
Neal while she disagreed with Trump on numerous issues, she was “happy that, on this single issue, he has reluctantly recognized the importance of homeownership.”
However, she would be “cautious about anything that is implemented by this administration regarding fairness and Americans’ well-being.”
She also decried previous efforts to stymie state action to regulate the industry. 
“I introduced a bill to curb the sale of homes to hedge funds and other corporate entities in the 2023 and 2025 sessions, and fought to include it in the most recent special session, but Gov. Lombardo has stopped my efforts every time,” she said. “Corporate greed has hollowed out our communities, putting the American dream out of reach for everyday Nevadans, and I hope that, with the President’s support, Gov. Lombardo will finally agree to put Nevadans first.” 
Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is running for governor, said in a statement that Trump’s announcement to crack down on corporate homeownership puts Lombardo at odds with the administration. 
Ford added that Lombardo has been the state’s “biggest roadblock to affordable housing.” 
“He vetoed and blocked similar plans to stop Wall Street firms from controlling our housing stock before refusing to include similar legislation in his special session proclamation,” Ford said.
“Joe Lombardo is now even more extreme than Donald Trump when it comes to helping families afford to buy a home,” said Hillary Barrett, executive director of the Nevada State Democratic Party. “As Nevadans struggle with housing costs, Lombardo has consistently fought to protect the profits of his Wall Street backers by blocking efforts to limit their ability to price people out of the housing market.” 
Housing organizers and legal aid groups have long warned about the rise of corporate entities purchasing large portions of housing stock amid a growing shortage of affordable and available housing. 
An analysis by Stateline found that nearly a quarter of all single-family homes sold in 2021 had been purchased by investors. In Nevada, the same analysis found, the share of investor purchases increased from 18% to 30% from 2020 to 2021.
The Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas estimated investors owned roughly 15% of homes in the City of Las Vegas. That percentage was expected to grow both in Nevada and across the nation.
Efforts to regulate the industry have repeatedly failed at the state Legislature. 
Neal introduced Senate Bill 395 in the 2023 session that sought to limit corporate investment to 1,000 housing units per year. 
The legislation passed in a mostly party line vote with Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen of Sparks joining Democrats. 
But the bill was vetoed by Lombardo, who wrote in veto message the bill would “arbitrarily limit the number of units a residential property lessor may acquire in one year.” 
“This bill would remove millions of dollars in commerce tax revenue from businesses engaged in the sale of real estate, detrimentally affect blue-collar trades by decreasing demand for new construction, and chill interest from Nevadan lessors during a period when renters are in desperate need of greater residential availability,” the governor wrote in his veto message.
Neal revived the failed bill in the 2025 regular session, this time reducing the number of homes corporate investors could purchase annually from 1,000 to 100.
The legislation needed to secure a two-thirds majority to pass since it imposed fees. Hansen voted against the bill, adding he was doing so “very reluctantly.” 
“For the first time this session, I have actually been asked by the executive branch to support a caucus ‘no’ position, which I have agreed to do,” Hansen said in a floor speech in May voting against the bill.
An effort to yet again rein in corporate investors was revived during the recent special session in November after Hansen, along with Assemblymember Alexis Hansen, his wife, signed a petition to have the bill considered. 
When a governor calls a special session in Nevada, lawmakers are limited to the topics included within the official proclamation. But legislators also have the ability to call themselves into a special session, if two-thirds of the members in both houses agree to it.
The legislation proposed a 1,000-unit cap on the total aggregate number of homes that could be purchased in a year by private investors. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office would help monitor a new corporate homeowner registry and determine when the 1,000-unit limit was reached.
Despite supporting the petition to bring the topic to the special session, Alexis Hansen cast the deciding ‘no’ vote that killed the corporate home ownership bill.
In a social media post following Trump’s announcement Wednesday, Ira Hansen wrote he “couldn’t be more pleased with this action.” 
Neal is expected to once again bring back legislation to crack down on corporate ownership during the 2027 legislative session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PXL_20250401_202855196-1024x731.jpg,,,2026-01-07 20:57:20.185358

Tim Walz speaks at the State Emergency Operations Center in Blaine, MN after a woman is killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday Jan. 7, 2025. (Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz issued an order for the Minnesota National Guard to prepare to be deployed if necessary following the killing of a 37-year-old woman by a federal immigration agent Wednesday.
Dozens of members of the State Patrol’s response team have also been activated to respond to possible unrest, Walz said at a news conference at the State Emergency Operations Center.
Walz’s quick action is no doubt informed by his response to the uprising following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, when critics said he was slow to marshal the state’s resources to restore order amid burning and looting, including of a Minneapolis police precinct.
An ICE officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37,  through her car window in south Minneapolis. Videos of the Wednesday incident show the woman beginning to drive away from the officer as he shot into the car. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said they have yet to see information indicating that the shooting was justified, though the Trump administration is accusing the deceased driver of “domestic terrorism.”
Walz said at a press conference at the State Emergency Operations Center that his administration “will stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.” The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is jointly investigating the killing with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Walz urged the federal government to remove its presence from Minnesota: “To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you’ve done enough.”
Walz was asked whether the National Guard would ever be deployed against federal agents. He didn’t answer directly, saying the National Guard’s deployment would be for the protection of Minnesotans: “Whatever it is: if it’s an act of nature, if it’s a global pandemic, or in this case, if it is a rogue federal agent. I don’t know this time.”
Walz is already at the center of an explosive confrontation between state and federal authorities. A bevy of federal agencies are investigating Minnesota social service and other safety net programs for evidence of fraud in the wake of a right wing media frenzy kicked off in November.
Walz announced Monday he was ending his campaign for a third term in the face of withering attacks from the Trump administration and right-wing influencers.
Ready for civil unrest
The State Emergency Operations Center has been activated at level two out of three levels — meaning that state is monitoring the situation —  as when Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed and Sen. John Hoffman and Yvette Hoffman badly injured by a gunman, as well as after the mass shooting at Annunciation Church.
The Minnesota National Guard leadership has connected with Minneapolis and St. Paul Police Departments, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Natural Resources and Minnesota’s Homeland Security Emergency Management, Walz said.
The preparation of state and local law enforcement agencies appears to be in anticipation of possible civil unrest, though Walz did not explicitly answer a question about what threshold of demonstrations it would take for him to deploy the Minnesota National Guard.
The shooting has already drawn outrage from thousands of protestors who gathered at the scene of the killing on Portland Avenue near 34th Street Wednesday.
Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety Bob Jacobson offered examples of what protestors are legally allowed to do: gather peacefully in walking spaces; march or walk, not on roadways; chant and make signs.
He then listed a slew of examples of actions that would result in fines or arrests: demonstrating on freeways on foot; walking on highways; throwing objects; starting fires; damaging or vandalizing property; using illegal fireworks; displaying or using illegal weapons; and reckless or dangerous driving.
“Minnesotans, do not take the bait. Do not allow them to deploy federal troops in the air. Do not allow them to invoke the Insurrection Act. Do not allow them to declare martial law. Do not allow them to lie about the security and the decency of the state. And let this investigation play itself out,” Walz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0976-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 19:58:45.027051

Sam Creekmore, the new chairman of the Mississippi House Public Health and Human Services Committee, speaks during a committee meeting at the State Capitol in Jackson, Miss., Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024.","The state House Public Health and Human Services Committee approved the same certificate of need bill language from last year’s legislative session Wednesday, minus a provision that led Gov. Tate Reeves to veto the legislation. The bill, which will make it easier for medical facilities to make capital improvements, now goes to the full House for a vote.
The early vote will give the committee an opportunity to propose additional changes later in the session to the law, which requires medical facilities to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new medical services, said committee Chairman Rep. Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, who authored the legislation in both years. 
“The goal was to get it to the governor as quickly as possible,” Creekmore told members of the State Board of Health during a Wednesday meeting following the vote. The group convened separately to consider possible changes to the certificate of need law. “I promised the committee today that there would be more (certificate of need legislation) coming,” he said. 
The bill would make it easier for medical facilities to make improvements to buildings and medical equipment and would require the University of Mississippi Medical Center to seek state approval before opening educational facilities outside a designated area in Jackson. It also directs the health department to study the feasibility of exempting small hospitals from approval requirements for dialysis and geriatric psychiatry services and requiring psychiatric facilities to treat a certain percentage of uninsured patients. 
It nixed a provision to grant a new certificate of need to Oceans Behavioral Hospital Jackson. The language, which was added during last year’s session as an amendment by Public Health and Welfare Chairman Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, would have ended a legal dispute between Oceans and another local hospital over the amount of free or low-cost care Oceans must provide to patients in need. The addendum led Reeves to veto lawmakers’ certificate of need, or CON, bill.

“The proposed amendment smacks of both imprudent legislative favoritism towards the entity that will receive the CON, as well as bald prejudice to the other market participants,” Reeves wrote in his veto message. “In either case, awarding a CON by legislative fiat is bad public policy.”
Certificate of need law is a familiar target for legislative reform in Mississippi, but few substantial changes have been made to the law since 2016. The law aims to lower costs and improve the quality and accessibility of health care by preventing duplication of services, but stakeholders are divided on whether or not it accomplishes its goals.
Critics argue the law stifles competition and fails to decrease costs. Advocates say it ensures that communities have access to a range of health services, not only those that are profitable. In Mississippi, where more than half of rural hospitals are at risk of closure, some people argue the law harms rural hospitals by restricting the services they are allowed to offer. 
Proposed changes to the law shapeshifted over the course of last year’s session. The Senate removed several key provisions of the bill originally approved by the House of Representatives, including those that would have streamlined the law’s appeals process and freed certain in-demand health care services – including substance use treatment and outpatient hospital dialysis units – from being required to acquire a certificate of need from the state to open.
At Wednesday’s meeting of the Board of Health’s certificate of need subcommittee, members expressed an appetite for reviving some of last year’s proposed changes in its recommendation to the full Board of Health.
The group discussed exempting some services, including substance use treatment and psychiatric services, from being required to acquire a certificate of need from the state to open — recommendations the committee has made in the past. It also suggested excusing small rural hospitals with existing certificates from the requirement to seek approval before adding services or making capital expenditures that exceed statutory limits.

“I think what these rural hospitals need is they need options for cash flow and revenue streams,” said Board of Health Chairman Dr. Lucius Lampton. “…If we don’t let them figure out some new revenue streams, they’re all going to close.”
State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney said that allowing rural hospitals to add new services helps keep patients in their communities instead of transferring them to distant facilities. 
“When we hear hospitals talk about expanding services, psych and dialysis are the two I hear them talk about most frequently,” he said. 
Dr. Thad Waites, a Hattiesburg cardiologist, said he is concerned that loosening restrictions that allow rural hospitals to open new clinics could scatter medical professionals in already understaffed areas and harm dialysis systems. 
“I fear that we’re going to be breaking something that ain’t broke,” he said.  
The subcommittee unanimously passed the recommendations, which will be refined before being presented to the full Board of Health at its next meeting on Jan. 14. Creekmore said the group’s proposals represent an initial step towards fine-tuning further changes to the state’s certificate of need law.
“I think what you’ve done is great, and that’s enough weight that we can at least get this process started being vetted in the Legislature.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073830/3X0A9202-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-07 19:58:45.027051

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As the Trump administration and its allies in the national Republican Party double down on their belief that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent acted in self-defense Wednesday when he fatally shot an American woman in Minneapolis, who was observing their activity in the city, Michigan Democrats and Republicans sounded off on the tragedy that has the potential to boil over in the coming days.
Both President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the shooting an act of self-defense. But multiple eyewitnesses and videos taken from several different angles at the scene of the shooting showed conflicting views of the event. That has led to outrage from Democrats and anti-ICE advocates over the agency’s unchecked ability to raid, detain and use deadly force against immigrants, and now American citizens.
One of the key videos being shared was obtained by the Michigan Advance’s sister publication, the Minnesota Reformer.

In Michigan, that same dynamic played out as Democratic and Republican lawmakers and candidates took sides quickly.
Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield) called the event horrific, and said the Department of Homeland Security’s public statements on the fatal shooting were “not only reckless – they appear to be outright falsehoods. If this Administration can label anyone a domestic terrorist to deflect responsibility, then every American is at risk.”
“Video evidence indicates that this was an unacceptable use of deadly force, and I call on my Republican colleagues to immediately convene public oversight hearings on this and numerous other reports of excessive force, intimidation, and other egregious conduct by federal officers,” Peters wrote on social media. 
Peters also called on Noem and her department to change course, truthfully inform the public, and engage in the appropriate oversight.
“Without this accountability, I am concerned tensions will only continue to escalate,” Peters wrote.
Michigan’s Democratic congressional representatives from Detroit, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib and U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, both decried the killing.
“ICE shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis today while she was trying to drive away from them,” Tlaib said. “Her killer must be held accountable and brought to justice. We need this rogue agency out of our neighborhoods.”
Dems demand investigation of fatal Minneapolis ICE shooting as Trump claims self-defense

Tlaib called to abolish ICE outright. Thanedar called for a full investigation and serious legal restraints on ICE, continuing his legislative push to end qualified immunity for the agency and its agents.
“It’s clear ICE is a group of untrained thugs, and they should not be above the law,” Thanedar said. “I will continue fighting to end qualified immunity to ensure ICE agents are held to the same legal standards as every other American.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), a candidate for the U.S. Senate, said the shooting death of the woman “unacceptable.”
“There needs to be a thorough and independent investigation into what happened, but what is clear is that the masked, armed, and untrained agents that Trump is lawlessly deploying to our cities are causing more harm, not protecting people,” Stevens said. “We cannot and should not allow the Trump administration to turn our communities into war zones.”
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), also a candidate for the U.S. Senate, said: “There’s no sugarcoating this; the president’s security theater just cost someone their life.”
Abdul El-Sayed, the third candidate in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary race, said the outcome of the shooting was sadly the logical one when the federal government puts “untrained personnel who have been told that they are above the law on peaceful streets.”
“We pray for the victim and her family and we demand an end to lawlessness in the name of the law,” El-Sayed said.
State. Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), a candidate for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, said the nation “cannot empower masked vigilantes to wreak havoc on civil neighborhoods under the guise of law enforcement.”
“This does not make us safer and today it tragically cost a life in Minnesota,” Moss said. “In Michigan, I’m working to unmask ICE, restore due process, and protect the rights of our immigrant and refugee communities.”

Michigan GOP stands with ICE, Trump and Noem
 U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), in a series of posts on X, blamed Democrats for ICE’s actions.
“This is what happens when Democrats continue to DEMONIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT,” McClain wrote in one post. “Praying for all our brave ICE agents who are working to keep us safe.”
In another resharing of a statement from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who said ICE needed to “get the f*ck out” of his city, McClain called his rhetoric dangerous while also laying no blame for the killing on ICE.
“Why is the socialist mayor of Minneapolis putting a TARGET on the backs of law enforcement?” McClain also wrote, and said the same about Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asking for any and all protests to remain peaceful as to not agitate an extreme federal response.
State Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), a GOP candidate for governor, in a series X posts, also said he proudly stood with ICE and that the agency was not the problem.
“Trying to run over law enforcement, throwing rocks at them, and trying to impede them from doing their job isn’t “protesting”. It’s domestic terrorism,” Nesbitt wrote in one post. “Praying for the safety of all our ICE agents federal law enforcement.”
Former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, another contender in the GOP gubernatorial hunt, said, “supporting illegals, fraudsters and liberal extremism over federal law enforcement officers is something you will NEVER see in Michigan when I’m Governor.”
Cox noted that his wife, former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Laura Cox, was an undercover ICE agent for 13 years, where she had carried out “drug raids, and arresting dangerous illegals to protect our Nation. That’s what ICE does EVERY DAY.”

(Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)North Carolina state House lawmakers were sharply critical Wednesday of DEI programs in Raleigh and Asheville, the latest Democratic-controlled cities to attract the ire of Republican legislative leaders.
The Republican-controlled legislature has passed several measures in the past two years banning “diversion, equity and inclusion” efforts in schools, public universities, and state government, saying they amount to racial preference.
At its meeting Wednesday, the North Carolina House Select Committee on Government Efficiency heard a lengthy presentation by Asheville attorney Ruth Smith, an unsuccessful 2024 legislative candidate, who alleged that Buncombe County and Asheville are using “equity” to allocate resources based on race. Smith says that violates the 14th Amendment, the North Carolina Constitution and federal anti-discrimination laws.
She cited examples including the 2021 Buncombe Racial Equity Plan as well as internships and scholarships that exclude white and Asian students.
Smith pointed to Buncombe County Justice Partners, a summer internship program for high school students in the area. It’s funded by the Buncombe County Bar and city of Asheville. The program exclusively excluded white and Asian students, Smith said, despite using state funds and taking place on state property at the Buncombe County Courthouse.
“I want to say clearly that I am not saying that race is not a problem in America, it’s not a problem in Buncombe County,” Smith said. “What I’m looking at is whether or not the remedies that Buncombe County and the city of Asheville are taking are constitutional or in violation of law.”
She also pointed to the City of Asheville Black Scholarship Fund. This program reallocated $500,000 from a class-action lawsuit over illegal water fees to establish scholarships for high school students and teachers. The funds were provided to a third party, the Asheville Schools Foundation, to administer.
“Every race was excluded, except for Black folks,” she said.
After a lawsuit, the scholarship was redrafted to include all high school students. A scholarship for Black teachers remains, Smith said.
No one representing the local governments of Asheville or Buncombe County offered testimony. It’s unclear whether they were invited to do so.
Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus) asked Smith how the city of Asheville and Buncombe County had justified their efforts.
Smith said they looked at disparities, applying resources based on race and assumptions about advantages.
“Again, I’m not saying that there aren’t disparities and that the goals aren’t what we should be doing, but you can’t discriminate on the basis of race,” she said. “The government cannot do that. It’s well established in the Supreme Court.”
Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell and City Manager Marchell Adams-David appeared in front of the panel after legislators summoned them to testify due to allegations that the city was still engaging in DEI efforts.
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders banning DEI in programs that use federal funding. That led to discussions among Raleigh city leaders, who suspended initiatives like equity training and an equity action plan to be in compliance with the orders.
The accusations against the city came about after a conservative activist posed as someone applying for a job within the city and asked about its support for DEI, recording an undercover video.
Cowell said she wasn’t aware of the video until lawmakers asked her to testify.
“We became aware of it when y’all asked us to appear,” she said.
Throughout the year, the city made other changes to meet federal compliance requirements, such as realigning department functions.
Adams-David emphasized that the city of Raleigh does not have quotas — there is no preferential treatment for certain backgrounds.
The city’s inclusion efforts, she said, are focused on economic development, not race. She pointed to a recent small business expo as an example.
“We work really hard to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to thrive,” Adams-David said. “When we make decisions from a fiduciary perspective, it doesn’t matter what race you are, what nationality you are, what religion you participate in or not, and the same thing applies when we make hiring decisions.”
Cowell said the city has other initiatives to help support small businesses as well.
There’s a lot of baby boomers who own businesses and are retiring, she said, so the city is working on helping to educate them on selling their businesses to their employees. “It’s a way to keep those businesses local, keep the wealth local, and do a nice transfer,” Cowell said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6334-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 19:58:45.027051

Gavin Newsom will propose regulating corporate landlords during his State of the State address Thursday, his office said. It’s a pivot toward populism for the governor.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom will propose regulating corporate landlords during his State of the State address Thursday, his office said. It’s a pivot toward populism for the governor.


In his final year in office, Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to go after large investors buying and owning California housing — in the same week that President Donald Trump also took rhetorical aim at Big Landlord.
It’s an unlikely meeting of the minds of two political foes who, in a race to head off the electorate’s concerns about affordability, have landed upon the same populist message: Blame Wall Street.
Newsom plans to say during his State of the State address to lawmakers on Thursday that he wants to work with them to regulate the practice of investors buying up large stocks of housing to rent out, forcing California residents to compete with them to afford buying a home, according to the governor’s office.
Proposals could include “enhanced state oversight and enforcement and potential changes to the state tax code,” according to the governor’s office.
“When housing is treated primarily as a corporate investment strategy, Californians feel the impact,” a source in the office said. “Prices go up, rents rise, and fewer people have a chance to buy a home.”
That sounds similar to a proposal Trump made on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. The two previously closely aligned on policy related to clearing of homeless encampments. 
“I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes,” the president wrote, sending stock prices of major publicly traded residential investment firms plummeting. He urged Congress to put the proposal into law and promised to unveil additional housing policy proposals at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland later this month.
Newsom is stopping short of calling for an outright ban on institutional investors’ ownership, though the source said he will seek to “curb” it with the goal of making home ownership more affordable for California residents. 
He hasn’t yet proposed anything concrete. Whatever Newsom seeks to do, he’ll need the approval of the state Legislature.
Trump, for his part, did not offer any details about his proposal, such as how institutional investors would be defined under the proposed law or why he targeted single-family homes in particular. The White House’s press office did not respond to an email with those questions. 
The twin announcements come after years of long-shot efforts by California progressives to address a surge in companies buying up single-family housing stock in the wake of the Great Recession. The issue has been the subject of renewed anxiety in post-fire Los Angeles, where a recent report by RedFin showed investors (loosely defined as any buyer with a name that includes “LLC,” “Inc” or “Corp”) have purchased 27 of 61 burned vacant lots that sold in Altadena — more than 40%. 
Asked about that report in an interview on MS Now this week, Newsom said he had signed an executive order last year seeking to protect homeowners who find it too expensive to rebuild from falling for “predatory” lowball offers for their properties. But he acknowledged “the broader market conditions are challenging.”
The proposals mark new territory for Newsom’s housing affordability platform. The governor, now in his final year in office, has spent most of the past seven years focused on boosting construction. It’s a pivot toward populism for the governor, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028.
Blaming deep-pocketed investors for the nation’s housing woes has become an increasingly ideological-spanning exercise in recent years, with politicians as diverse as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vice President J.D. Vance championing the cause.
Shortly after Trump’s post, Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio, an enthusiastic supporter of the president, promised to introduce legislation in his own post on X.
Is this actually a problem in California?
Many housing industry professionals, economists and policy researchers are skeptical.
“It’s really hard to buy a house right now so people are looking for someone to blame for that, but I think (institutional investors) are more of a symptom of the affordability crisis than they are a perpetuator of it,” said Caitlin Gorback, a University of Texas at Austin economist who has studied investors’ effect on local real estate markets.
Research on the topic is mixed, though most analyses have found that by taking owner-occupied homes  and converting them into rentals, these companies tend to increase the supply of rentals. That puts downward pressure on rents, while taking away purchasable homes, leading to higher prices. 
That also takes away opportunities for would-be homeowners to buy a coveted single-family home. But even that comes with an under-appreciated upside, said Gorback: They provide more priced-out renters the opportunity to live in single-family homes — typically in wealthier, whiter and higher-resourced neighborhoods — something historically reserved for those who can afford to buy.
While apartment buildings are commonly owned and managed by large financial companies, single-family rentals weren’t seen as Wall Street-worthy money-making opportunities until the aftermath of the Great Recession. Since then, companies like Invitation Homes, Blackstone, Progress Residential and AMH Homes have typically focused on markets with relatively low prices and rapidly growing populations.
That doesn’t describe California. As a result, larger investors — however defined — make up a relatively small share of single-family landlords in the state. Fewer than 3% of all single-family homes in the state are owned by companies that own at least 10 properties, according to an analysis by the California Research Bureau, which conducts research for state lawmakers. A mere 20,066 are owned by firms with portfolios of 1,000 units or more. The largest of those owners is Invitation Homes, which owns over 11,000 homes in the state and reached a settlement with Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office last year over allegations it price-gouged tenants and illegally raised rents on more than 1,900 properties.
There are more than 16 million rental units across the state, according to Census data.
Though attacking big monied investors for the high cost of housing is a “huge distraction,” it has obvious political appeal, said Stan Oklobdzija, a UC Riverside public policy professor. “Attacking institutional investors is the latest iteration of appearing to do something without actually doing anything. …It’s just kind of archetypical cheap talk.”
For nearly a decade, Democrats in the state Legislature have proposed bills to track or ban the practice. Former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 vetoed a bill to create a registry of institutional investors that own 100 or more single-family homes, noting that “collecting the data would not stop the purchase of these homes by private investors.” 
In 2024, lawmakers proposed banning investors that own at least 1,000 single-family homes from buying more houses and renting them out, prohibiting institutional investors from buying single-family homes for any reason and banning developers from selling entire new single-family subdivisions to investors to rent. All three bills died in committees. 
Assemblymember Alex Lee, author of the first proposal, revived the bill last year. It passed the Assembly and awaits a hearing in a Senate committee. 
Lee, a Democratic Socialist who has long critiqued the role of big money in the state’s real estate market, said he was “flabbergasted” to find himself on the same page with Trump, whom he described as a “far-right fascist.” Though he expressed doubts that the Trump administration would follow through with the promises the president made in his social media post, he said that “Democrats need to wake up to this populist, but righteous, position.”
“We can’t let the far-right capture the housing positions that the people care about,” Lee said.
Newsom evidently agrees.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010625-Newsom-Budget-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 19:12:27.449391

The conservative Republican and Casper businessman faces competition from Secretary of State Chuck Gray, and likely others, for Wyoming’s lone House seat.
The post Reid Rasner announces bid for U.S. House seat appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Casper-based businessman Reid Rasner has officially announced his candidacy for Wyoming’s sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the second entrant into the race following Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s announcement at the end of 2025.
Rasner, a conservative Republican who previously unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Sen. John Barrasso in 2024 in the Senate primaries, is entering the race with a personal commitment of $1 million to his campaign to spread his self-described “America First” platform to voters across the state.
According to a news release, Rasner is a fourth-generation Wyomingite who hopes to dismantle the status quo in Washington, D.C. He stated he hopes to work alongside President Donald Trump to “codify every piece of his agenda into law.”
“I am a proud and unapologetic America First conservative who will work with President Trump to deport criminal illegals, get fentanyl out of our communities, stop Democrat extremists and protect what makes Wyoming great,” Rasner wrote.
A staunch conservative
Rasner’s policy goals focus heavily on economic independence, border security and traditional conservative values, according to his website.
A central pillar of Rasner’s platform is domestic energy dominance. He advocates for Wyoming’s fossil fuel energy industry, specifically supporting Trump’s “Drill, Baby, Drill” policies for oil and gas, revitalizing the coal industry and investing in uranium mining in Wyoming. His vision for the state also includes transforming Wyoming into a national hub for financial technology, using the state’s business-friendly laws and lower taxes to attract global companies.
Rasner’s website outlines several other political views. This includes advocating for term limits to ensure citizen legislators over lifelong politicians, cutting federal government spending he sees as wasteful and defending the right to bear arms, including firearm safety education in schools.
He also maintains that life begins at conception. His social media post criticized Tuesday’s Wyoming Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of abortion in Wyoming.
2026 election and implications 
Rasner’s entry into the 2026 race comes at a time of significant transition for Wyoming’s federal delegation. The landscape shifted in December when Republican U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis announced that she would not seek a second six-year term. 
This prompted current Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman to announce her intent to launch a bid for the Senate, a move that quickly garnered an endorsement from Trump.
The open seat in the House has already attracted other high-profile contenders. 
Secretary of State Gray announced his bid for the seat on Dec. 29, running as a “MAGA conservative.”
In his 2024 GOP bid for U.S. Senate, Rasner earned around 25,000 primary votes, or about 24%.
TikTok bid and defamation lawsuit
Rasner’s announcement follows a turbulent year in the headlines, defined by a high stakes business bid and an ongoing legal battle. In early 2025, Rasner garnered international attention for a reported $47.45 billion bid to purchase TikTok after the platform was ordered to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
Rasner proposed moving the social media giant’s headquarters and data centers to Wyoming or South Dakota. 
However, by July, Rasner announced a “pause” on the acquisition, citing Chinese foreign policy and TikTok parent company ByteDance’s refusal to include the app’s core algorithm in the sale. Later, Rasner also cited comments made online that he said harmed his business reputation, ultimately leading to the failure of the deal.
This has resulted in an ongoing defamation lawsuit against former Wyoming State Sen. Anthony Bouchard. The lawsuit, filed in July, stems from social media posts in which Bouchard alleged that Rasner had a record of sexual misconduct while teaching at Casper College.
Rasner has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them a “malicious lie.” 
In late 2025, an affidavit from Casper College President Brandon Kosine revealed that an exhaustive search found no reports of sexual misconduct or investigations involving Rasner at the school. 
While the legal proceedings are ongoing, Rasner has indicated he will continue to seek legal action against those who shared those messages on social media.
“I’ve spent my career in the private sector getting things done, and I’m ready to take that know-how and the values of Wyomingites to Congress to Make America Great Again. I hope to earn your support as I crisscross the state,” Rasner wrote in his campaign news release.
At the time of publication, Rasner has yet to file for the race, and Gray is the only candidate to have officially filed so far.
In 2025, a campaign finance account emerged for Rasner under the office of governor. However, he never announced the run and confirmed he is not seeking to put together a bid for Wyoming governor in 2026.
(WyoFile editor’s note: In December, Bouchard filed a third party complaint against WyoFile, seeking to join the news outlet in the Rasner v. Bouchard litigation. WyoFile never alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Rasner.)

State agency director resigned under pressure in November and weeks later signed on to replace recently retired Doug Brimeyer.

Jeff Davis, who was trained and worked as a biologist, will assume leadership of external operations at Game and Fish in early February, according to spokeswoman Amanda Fry. The hire drew a spate of headlines in Colorado partly because of the circumstances of Davis’ departure: He resigned in November instead of being terminated, according to documents acquired by 9News, the NBC affiliate in Denver.

The settlement agreement acquired by 9News did not specify why Davis was going to be fired, and a spokesman for the agency told the station he couldn’t comment on the matter. 
At the time of Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s late November announcement, Davis was said to be transitioning into a “senior policy advisor” role under Colorado Department of Natural Resources Executive Director Dan Gibbs. 
Less than a month later, however, Davis signed an employment offer from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, according to additional documents acquired by 9News. 
Davis was hired by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in the spring of 2023. Before that, he worked as the director of conservation for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, capping a 22-year stint with that state agency.

For the last couple of years, Davis has helmed Parks and Wildlife through the high-profile and voter-initiated reintroduction of wolves to Colorado. 
Wolves have been a point of friction between Wyoming and Colorado even before reintroduction. The first Colorado wolf packs in 80 years resulted from natural dispersers who showed up on their own in 2019. In 2023, citing state statute, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department stopped informing the then-Davis-led Colorado Parks and Wildlife when members of another pack of dispersed wolves were killed by hunters north of the state line.
Subsequently, Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish director, began challenging Colorado’s wolf reintroduction after his Trump administration appointment to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
On December 19, Nesvik sent Colorado Parks and Wildlife Acting Director Lauren Clellan a letter threatening to take over management of wolves in Colorado unless the state addressed compliance issues, according to reporting by the Fort Collins Coloradoan. 
Three days later, Davis, who’d already been ousted, signed the job offer with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

Davis steps into a post vacated by Doug Brimeyer, a Jackson-based wildlife biologist who rose through the ranks and retired after a 34-year career. 
“The wildlife and landscapes of western Wyoming provided an incredible backdrop for a career I’ve been truly grateful for,” Brimeyer wrote in an outgoing email to friends and colleagues. “I’ve had a fantastic career and have been fortunate to work with so many dedicated, talented wildlife professionals.”

Blake Tillery, the Vidalia Republican who chairs the Senate Special Committee on the Elimination of Georgia's Income Tax, unveiled the committee's recommendations at its final meeting on Jan. 7, 2026, in Atlanta. Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderGeorgia GOP Senate leaders unveiled a plan Wednesday that would entirely eliminate the personal state income tax by 2032, shortly before House Speaker Jon Burns said the House would focus on cutting property taxes.
A special Senate committee voted 6-3, along party lines, to adopt its final legislative recommendations, which would waive income taxes for all Georgians on up to $50,000 a year for individuals and $100,000 for married couples starting in 2027.
Sen. Blake Tillery, the Vidalia Republican who chaired the committee, said the proposal is a “bottom-up” approach aimed at addressing rising costs for struggling Georgians. He pitched it as a solution to recent concerns about affordability, which Democrats successfully campaigned on in the 2025 off-year elections.
“The issue of affordability has been a buzzword since probably June or July,” said Tillery, who is also the Senate’s top budget writer. “This is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability. I would urge you to think about that and think about how you can continue to say that that’s the number one issue, if you don’t support addressing it for Georgia families here.”

The plan would cost the state about $3 billion in the first year. To pay for it, Tillery pointed to nearly $1.9 billion surplus from the previous budget year as well as $1 billion in savings from a move to finance capital projects rather than using cash, and he said the rest could come from trimming roughly 10% of the state’s $30 billion in special-interest tax credits. The proposal is a priority for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who formed the committee and is running for governor in 2026. Tillery is a candidate for lieutenant governor.

In a press conference later on Wednesday, Burns, a Newington Republican, also acknowledged that affordability is a top issue going into the 2026 session. But he said the House will prioritize cutting property taxes on primary residences, saying that some Georgians have seen property tax increases of up to 185% over the previous year.
“That’s grossly unfair to Georgia homeowners, and probably just as importantly, maybe not quite as important, but it’s not sustainable,” Burns said.
But both Tillery and Burns said they would be open to considering each other’s proposals, with Tillery saying that he does “not view this as an either-or with the House.”
“The revenues go to completely different places, and the plan that we’ve drawn out with our state revenues to make this work are in no way impacted by anything they bring on property taxes,” Tillery said.
Burns said that “there’s nothing [the House and the Senate] can’t talk about,” but he was more critical of the Senate proposal, saying the math does not add up.
“We have to have the details, and it has to work, and we need to make sure we can continue to provide those services: health care, public safety, education, all the things we’ve talked about that continue to make Georgia the very best place to live and work,” Burns said.
Democrats on the Senate committee pushed back on the income tax cut proposal, saying that it would create a “$16 billion hole” in the state budget while ignoring critical needs in mental health, education and rural health care.
“This report recommends capping the budget and continuing to have our hands behind our back in terms of meeting the needs that we have,” said Atlanta Democratic Sen. Nan Orrock, adding that the state should instead focus on helping rural counties “that are so bereft of medical services,” increasing access to mental health services or fully funding pre-K for all Georgians.

Orrock also said that there is too much uncertainty around how Georgia will adapt to incoming federal funding cuts, which will reduce the state’s federal Medicaid funding by an estimated $5.4 billion over the next decade, according to a recent Georgia Health Initiative report.
“We heard no information in the course of this committee’s hearings on the impact of the cuts in Washington that are coming down that will hit our budget … We’re going to have needs that can be documented — should have been documented,” Orrock said.
Orrock also said that once fully implemented, the income tax cut would largely benefit people earning over $100,000, with $11.5 billion in tax cuts for the top 26% of income earners, compared to the $4 billion tax cut to the other three-quarters of Georgians.
“Is that what the citizenry is calling for? Helping the rich get richer? I don’t think so,” Orrock said after the meeting.
Danny Kanso, a senior fiscal analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, also said that the proposal would largely benefit the wealthy. In a statement, he said that 74% of all benefits would go to households earning six-figures or more per year, adding that “this proposal would dramatically push Georgia’s budget out of balance in order to enrich those already at the top of the economic ladder, while working and middle-class families ultimately foot the bill.”
Without finding a new source of revenue to replace the $16 billion in personal income tax currently collected, most Georgians could see overall state taxes increase once the program is fully implemented, according to GBPI.
“The committee’s lack of specific recommendations to replace Georgia’s largest revenue source speaks volumes and points towards the most likely outcome: increasing Georgia’s sales tax and raising the cost of living,” Kanso said. “While most Georgians would see an average net tax increase of about $1,000 per year if the state shifts to a sales tax-based revenue system, those in the top 1% (earning more than $835,000 per year) would see average tax cuts of about $60,000 per year.”
Democratic Sen. Ed Harbison of Columbus called the proposed deductions “a hard thing to vote against,” but said the committee should be more fiscally conservative with the timeline. Instead of “taking one giant step and doing it all in one fell swoop,” Harbison suggested the committee should instead consider a more gradual income tax decrease.
“I hear your very logical and conservative budgeting, and I applaud you for that. We have been doing that, and I thought that we would continue down that road,” he said.

With only four weeks to sway voters, two Republican state Senate hopefuls are on the clock to prove who opposes a controversial Franklin County prison project more — or find another issue that resonates.

Wade Dunn, a retired businessman who has the endorsement of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield’s family, and Brad Simon, a small business owner who vastly outspent the other Republicans in the race, advanced to a Feb. 6 runoff. The winner of that race will face independent Adam Watson in the March 3 special election.
Tuesday’s special primary for Senate District 26, which is comprised of parts of Franklin, Logan, Sebastian and Johnson counties, drew much higher than typical turnout.
The relatively short campaign period in the run-up to Tuesday’s primary was dominated by the candidates’ opposition to the 3,000-bed Franklin County prison project championed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her allies that has earned the ire of local officials and residents.
Sanders and prison supporters say it is a necessary solution to longstanding state prison capacity shortages. But opponents say locals were not given a say in locating the prison in their community, and argue the 815-acre site isn’t right for the facility.
Republican primary for Arkansas Senate seat at center of prison project debate headed to runoff

In Franklin and Logan counties, “the proximity to the prison issue drove turnout to be probably, what I would say, twice as high what you would see in an average special election primary,” Robert Coon, a Republican strategist and lobbyist, said. Comparatively, turnout in Sebastian and Johnson counties was much lower.
Franklin County and Logan County saw 16.7% and 19.1% of registered voters cast ballots in the election. In Sebastian and Johnson counties, 9.6% and 7.5% of voters went to the polls — numbers still much higher than turnout in the other special election for House District 70, which saw 3.8% of registered voters cast a vote.
Primaries generally have lower turnout compared to general elections, he said, and tend to consist of the most active voters. The higher turnout in some, but not all, counties was a sign of the prison project’s importance in the minds of the voters set to be most affected by the prison, he said.
One of the biggest challenges for the candidates will be getting people to keep paying attention since turnout likely won’t be as high in the runoff, Coon said. Since both Republicans vying for the nomination have largely similar platforms, he said, the candidates will need to find differentiators that matter to voters over the next four weeks.
Nationwide, affordability is shaping up to be a talking point in the 2026 midterms, and Arkansas is no exception, Coon said.
“If you ask people, ‘What’s the number one issue if I’m going to earn your vote,’ we know what they’re going to say,” he said. “But what are issues two and three, and can one of the candidates make some gains with that?”
Dunn touted his support Wednesday for eliminating property taxes on people over the age of 65 and veterans, and for creating an Arkansas equivalent to Elon Musk’s short-lived Department of Government Efficiency — known as DOGE — at the federal level.
“This thing comes down to trust,” Dunn said. Voters will have to decide a basic question when choosing between him and Simon, he said: “Are these men going to represent the people, or are they going to represent the government?”
Simon has said he wants to continue lowering income taxes and reduce state regulation. Wednesday, he also cited cutting taxes and easing inflation pressure as top issues.
“We need an effective voice for our district, not just the loudest voice in the room,” he said in a text message. “Someone that has proven they can get things done against all odds.”
Still, the prison issue dominates. In an interview with the Arkansas Advocate, Watson said that “nine times out of ten,” the first question he is asked when he’s knocking on doors and talking to voters is about his position on the prison.
Former state Rep. Mark Berry, who came in third in the unofficial results, told the Advocate he was endorsing Simon in the runoff, calling the primary’s runner up a “man of principle” while criticizing Dunn as someone who would “do and say anything to get elected.”
Stacie Smith and Ted Tritt, the other two Republican candidates who conceded, had not announced endorsements of either of their former opponents as of Wednesday afternoon.

“After significant consideration, as part of our ongoing efforts to operate more efficiently and responsibly — especially in light of anticipated budget shortfalls — we will be making a change to the paid parental leave policy,” Skinner wrote, according to a copy of the email that the Idaho Capital Sun obtained through a public records request. “… This decision was not made lightly.

The cut — issued just before the Legislature will reconvene as the state faces projected budget deficits  — sets the Attorney General’s Office apart from executive branch agencies managed by Gov. Brad Little. In 2020, Little issued an executive order requiring eight weeks of paid time off for executive branch agencies, and he encouraged the state’s other elected officials to follow suit. 
“The eight-week paid parental leave began in 2020 as a discretionary executive policy, not a legislative mandate,” the Attorney General Office’s General Counsel and latest Chief of Staff Yvonne Dunbar said in a statement Wednesday. “As public servants, we work for Idaho taxpayers, and this adjustment reflects our commitment to responsible stewardship of their resources while supporting our team.”
Staff in the Attorney General’s Office who need more time after the birth or adoption of a child, and who qualify for leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, “may use accrued sick leave, as well as unpaid FMLA leave,” Skinner wrote in the email to staff. 
Labrador’s spokesperson Damon Sidur said Skinner was promoted to chief deputy attorney general on Monday.

State leaders told lawmakers some version of the model might help in the rest of the state, but Chittenden County’s uniqueness as an urban hub made it well-suited for the pilot.

Court backlog. 
The phrase has defined a malaise that’s permeated the Vermont Legislature’s work on public safety initiatives in recent years. When Covid-19 slowed down the judicial system, criminal cases piled up, leading defendants and victims to wait years for resolution.
Enter the Chittenden County accountability docket. Proposed by Gov. Phil Scott last fall, the pilot project dedicated court time and staff to expediting hearings for people with five or more pending criminal cases, sometimes called dockets. 
On Wednesday, some of the key leaders of the program reported the project had been a success. But its future — whether in Chittenden County or expanded across the state — is uncertain. 
Since October, the special court or “docket,” which focuses on lower-level offenses, has resolved almost 400 cases of the nearly 900 under its purview, according to data presented by Jaye Johnson, the governor’s counsel, to the House Committee on Corrections and Institutions. 
Having recently spent a day observing a Burlington courthouse, Rep. Brian Minier, D-South Burlington, summed up the special program’s effectiveness. In a “regular” courtroom, hearings were scheduled three months out. But in room 3B — the designated space for the accountability program — the judge met weekly with defendants. 
Tim Lueders-Dumont, who leads the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, said the promise of the pilot hinged on the excellent collaboration between the special prosecutor, designated defense attorney, the judge and human services staff. 
It’s been “successful,” he said, but “we’re not going to say mission accomplished.”
The Burlington-based initiative is scheduled to phase out in the beginning of February. Rutland County is a possible location for a next version of the program, the leaders hinted, but they stressed that Chittenden County’s model won’t work everywhere. Conversations have begun to figure out how every county might create designated time for resolving cases involving defendants with numerous dockets. 
And that model makes sense, according to the data. Statewide, cases involving people with five or more pending dockets make up 28% of all dockets, according to Lueders-Dumont. Those with three or more make up about half.

In the know
Vermont Foodbank CEO John Sayles updated the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry on Wednesday morning about his organization’s Vermonters Feeding Vermonters program, which spent hundreds of thousands in public and philanthropic funds purchasing food from local farmers in 2025. But after Act 34 created a grant program for the initiative last year without guaranteed funding, state budget writers approved just a fraction of the backing Sayles — and the agriculture committee — sought.
“One of the key provisions of our food security roadmap is making sure our agriculture community is strong,” Sayles said in his testimony Wednesday.
In addition to a $1.5 million budget increase to this year’s $500,000 grant for Vermonters Feeding Vermonters, the Foodbank will request a total of $5 million for next year to fully fund the program again, and shore up the organization’s ability to meet emergency need in “natural and man-made disasters,” Sayles said.
Though food assistance is a priority for legislative leaders, many have said this session’s financial pressures — both from federal cuts and an apparent dip in state revenues — may make grants to individual organizations significantly more competitive.

On the move … or not?
“It’s pure bullshit.”
That’s what Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told reporters Wednesday about the notion that there isn’t enough support in the House this year to advance a charter change bill that would ban guns from bars in Burlington.
Baruth is the measure’s primary backer. Since the bill, S.131, passed the Senate last April, it got a lukewarm reception in the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee and stalled there. The proposal also has a powerful opponent: Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who has said repeatedly he’d veto it, should legislators send it to his desk. (Charter changes must get approval in Montpelier before they can take effect locally.)
Baruth, Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and City Council President Ben Traverse held a press conference Wednesday at the Statehouse to drum up support for the measure and call on the House to pass it. During the presser, Baruth suggested that if the government operations committee wouldn’t move the bill, an individual House member should stand up on the floor and ask that gov ops be relieved of it. From there, the member could ask that it be directed to a different committee. (Such a procedural move would require majority support to succeed.)
House gov ops heard some testimony on the charter change Wednesday morning, though took no action on it. Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, the gov ops chair, said his panel planned to discuss the bill further in the coming weeks but was not sure yet whether he would bring it up for a committee vote.

Above the law
The Senate Judiciary Committee briefly discussed Wednesday some of their unique and ancient protections. State law prohibits legislators and many statewide elected officials from being arrested on their way to and from their work at the Statehouse, except for felonies, treason and breach of peace. That includes traffic tickets on the way to work, apparently, according to Sen. Chris Mattos, R-Chittenden North. But they can be sent those tickets later. Careful on 89.

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Riewestahl said the ICE agents were identified when they arrived at the courthouse and parked a vehicle in the parking lot.
The federal agents “entered on the ground floor and stood in the vestibule,” Riewestahl said. “Some were making phone calls, others were just on their phones and/or talking amongst themselves.”
He added that a “few went further into the courthouse,” probably to use the restrooms.
Concerning whether the ICE agents had contacted his office requesting help to detain people, Riewestahl said, “They have not, nor have we assisted with anything related to ICE.”
Riewestahl shared that the office’s policy manual for field services (patrol) and security services (jail) regarding immigration status directs patrol officers not to detain anyone accused of a “civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant,” and the jail is only allowed to hold individuals who have “been charged with a federal crime,” or has been issued “a warrant, affidavit of probable cause or removal order.”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Two days into Rhode Island’s six-month 2026 legislative session, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley briefed reporters Wednesday afternoon on his legislative priorities.
Smiley told reporters at City Hall that his administration’s priorities “have remained pretty consistent” since he took office in 2023, and this year is more of the same, with his office seeking to stabilize city finances, address the housing market and take back Providence’s public schools from the state control they’ve been under since 2019.  
“There’s sure to be other pieces of legislation that individual legislators promote that we will throw our support behind,” Smiley said. “But these are our priorities and our package.”
One notable omission in light of the Dec. 13 mass shooting at Brown University is legislation on gun control. Smiley noted the state already has “relatively strict gun regulations” and Providence is not proposing any new ones. But he said “it’s entirely possible” the city could support such legislation if it appears at the State House this year.
The city has not yet tallied the total municipal cost of its response to the shooting which killed two teenaged Brown undergrads and injured nine other students. In the midst of the chaos, the city’s ledgers were not of great import, Smiley said. 
“There was never a decision that was made, or a choice that was deferred or denied, based upon what the overtime cost might have been from any of the public safety tools at our disposal.”
Cost resumes its usual relevance, however, in the city’s legislative priorities this session. Smiley could not specify which state legislators would sponsor the city’s bills, as his office is still hammering out sponsorship with General Assembly leadership. The mayor’s office estimated the bills will likely be submitted later this month. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2026 legislative wish list for his city includes an increase to the state’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) base rate and a 25% payroll tax tied to new jobs at tax-exempt nonprofit institutions. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
1: Increase the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) rate statewide
Smiley acknowledged that all signs point to “a tough budget year for the state,” but he’s hoping legislators will agree to shoulder a three-pillared support system for Providence’s own finances in the upcoming fiscal year. First on his wishlist is increasing the state’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) base rate from 27% to 30% of foregone revenue.
Municipalities make PILOT agreements with nonprofits to generate revenue that is lost due to the organizations’ tax-exempt status. The state also doles out PILOT funds to municipalities via a calculation that combines the total assessed value of tax-exempt properties statewide, which is then divvied up and “gets sent back proportionally to cities and towns based upon the tax exempt property that they have in their respective communities,” Smiley explained.  
“What we’re saying is the pot should get bigger,” Smiley said.
He said the PILOT rate has not been increased since 1986.
The city hasn’t convened with other municipalities yet about the legislation, Smiley said, but the mayor expects other towns and cities will get on board as “anybody who receives PILOT funding will benefit from this.” 
PILOT payments are especially important in Providence, where nonprofits eat up an estimated 42% of the city’s real estate, leaving the city unable to reap benefits from the approximately $8 billion in assessed value these properties represent.    
Smiley’s administration helped broker the city’s PILOT deals with large nonprofits like Brown University and Brown University Health. But Smiley did not seek to further antagonize the nonprofits. The bargaining table, he said, often revolves around “not an impasse…just a slow negotiation.”
“I think the events of last month underscore a point that we’ve made for a long time, which is that all of our fates are tied together,” the mayor said. “I want the hospitals to be financially successful. They need to want the city to be financially stable.”

2: 25% payroll tax tied to new jobs at tax-exempt nonprofit institutions. 
Providence submitted this legislation two years ago, Smiley said, and it returns now as he still believes it a suitable way to procure more revenue from nontaxable nonprofits. The mayor clarified that while the proposal would not fatten the state’s current deficit, it would ultimately draw from the future state’s tax base, because Providence would receive a share of the state’s income tax.
Still, the arrangement could be beneficial for all involved, Smiley thought: “It’s in the state’s best interest that the city, instead of fighting the institutions’ growth, be encouraging the institutions’ growth, and that we be partners with the state in trying to get these places to add jobs and grow.”
3: Full funding of the Distressed Communities Relief Fund in the state budget
Providence got about $8 million last year from this funding source in the state budget last year. Smiley said he wants the state to keep the line item “held flat, to not be cut,” which would leave Providence’s share at roughly $8.1 million.
The preliminary version of Gov. Dan McKee’s budget is expected to arrive in the days after his Jan. 13 State of the State address. Lawmakers will then refine the budget throughout the legislative session.

4: Is this the year Providence gets its schools back?
Another legislative package wrapped in déjà vu is the city’s request to get back its public schools from the Rhode Island Department of Education. Smiley said he wants the schools to return to local control by July 2026, adding the legislation “should be no surprise.”
The protracted tug of war for power over the capital city’s historically underperforming schools began in 2019, when the education department assumed control via a little-used state law. In 2024, the state extended its control up to 2027. The same year, city and state concluded a funding dispute in court, with Providence on the hook for at least three years’ worth of boosted funding.
That settlement is still shaping the city’s fiscal commitments to its schools, with Smiley noting that about $147.5 million overall is earmarked for fiscal year 2027, plus whatever percentage increase in education aid appears in this year’s state budget.
The transition could happen through legislation or from direct action by state education commissioner Angélica Infante-Green. 
“We would be happy for her to make a commitment next week that the schools are coming back this summer,” Smiley said, and argued that the purely legislative route was still suboptimal. “Getting permission in June for a July takeback would be difficult and probably a bumpier transition than is in the best interest of students.” 
Providence submitted similar legislation last year, but this year, things are different because the city has “stayed at work since the end of the legislative session,” Smiley said. “Similarly, the school board has done exactly what they have been asked to do.”
Providence School Board President Ty’Relle Stephens submitted a letter to legislative leadership Wednesday afternoon in support of the still-to-come legislation.
5: Return of the housing bond
A $25 million general obligation housing bond could go before voters this November, if lawmakers approve Providence’s request for the ballot. Smiley said voters last approved a housing bond in 2021, and that the $29 million it allocated helped to “seed” the city’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund. But there’s now less than $1 million left to disperse from that bond, Smiley said.
The taxpayer money borrowed via bond issue would “be restricted to affordable housing projects here in Providence,” Smiley said, arguing a new bond would help the city seize competitive borrowing rates and maintain momentum on easing the housing shortage.
6: More enforcement of penalties for box blockers
More modest among Smiley’s proposals is a request to extend the city’s “Block the Box” pilot program to 2030. In 2024, lawmakers authorized municipalities to enforce violations at up to three intersections for motorists whose impatience causes them to clog intersections.   
The program will sunset in 2027, but Smiley said the city needs more time to test and analyze the data of its camera-driven enforcement to stop box-blocking. Providence’s pilot program remains so nascent that Smiley said the city has not yet found a suitable vendor for the needed technology, because “other communities in America are not doing this. The city is reviewing responses it received from a request for proposals that went out in fall 2025.
“All of our camera technology in Providence is not meant to be revenue-enhancing,” Smiley said. “It’s meant to be behavior-changing…We want people to follow the rules of the road and not enrage people by standing in the middle of an intersection when the light turns red.”

 7: Protecting a bridge to nowhere 
The Crook Point Bascule Bridge, also known in local tongue as the Ghost Bridge, sits at the perimeter of Providence’s Fox Point and stretches over the Seekonk River — well, only partially, as it’s been drawn up since 1976. Smiley wants the state to authorize a new quasi-public agency, the Crook Point Bridge Authority, to whom the Rhode Island Department of Transportation could transfer ownership.
Smiley admitted his imaginings for the iconic landmark don’t quite fit his reputation for exacting governance: “This is a little bit unlike me in that we don’t have a firm plan for this bridge.”
But Smiley thinks the much-graffitied but much-loved structure could be renewed in its importance if owned by a non-governmental entity, which would make it easier to fundraise and manage insurance and liability for what he called an “an asset that is admittedly old.”
“There’s a lot of foundations and such that have either actual restrictions or no interest in giving to government itself,” Smiley said. 
The mayor is opposed to demolishing the bridge — something RIDOT tried to do in 2019 — and noted the pedestrian bridge near South Water Street as proof the city can brainstorm first, blueprint later. 
The annual upkeep for Crook Point span is “de minimis,” Smiley said, limited to things like fixing fences or mowing brush in the area. The city has no desire to make the bridge operational, lower the span, or fix its rusty gears.
“We want to make sure that it remains safe and stable until such time as we have a full plan for it,” Smiley said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s troubling rates of violence against women have driven me, over several years, to attempt to understand why this crisis persists and what it will take to meaningfully reverse it. I don’t claim to have every answer, but I have developed a deeper understanding of the interconnected factors that — often invisibly — contribute to this violence. One of these factors is the lack of appetite Utahns — both leaders and residents — have to break the silence and face this issue head on.
As you might imagine, the perpetuation of violence is a complex issue that is often ignored in many U.S. states and other counties around the world. Utah is no exception. Violence against women is an uncomfortable topic, and concerns are often swept under the rug. Even though this violence is widespread worldwide, it remains one of the most silenced social issues. Several interconnected forces drive that silence in Utah and beyond. I will highlight six:
First, it’s uncomfortable and socially taboo: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) notes that gender‑based violence remains “shrouded in silence” because it is considered uncomfortable and stigmatized to discuss openly. People fear saying the wrong thing, being judged, or confronting painful realities. According to another source, silence becomes a form of self‑protection — both for individuals who don’t want to disrupt social harmony and for institutions that fear reputational consequences. In many communities, naming the problem feels like an accusation, so people default to avoiding it altogether. This avoidance doesn’t reduce the violence; it simply pushes it further underground.
Second, it challenges existing power structures: Violence against women is rooted in deep power imbalances. Naming the problem forces communities, institutions, and individuals to confront the ways power is misused or protected. That makes people defensive — especially those who benefit from the status quo. One global study highlighted how communities resist acknowledging violence, especially when it challenges cultural or patriarchal norms. When these norms are challenged, leaders and residents frequently deny or minimize the violence, and survivors who speak up face social retaliation for disrupting the expected order.
Third, it hits close to home. Most violence against women is committed by intimate partners or family members, not strangers lurking in dark alleys. Talking about it means acknowledging that the threat isn’t “out there” — it’s inside homes, families, churches, and communities. That proximity makes people shut down. It forces communities to confront the possibility that respected neighbors, leaders, or even relatives may be perpetrators. Research from a “Women in the States” report further shows that intimate partner violence cuts across every demographic group, reinforcing that no community is exempt. When the danger is this close, denial becomes a coping mechanism, and silence becomes a way to preserve the illusion of safety.
Fourth, people underestimate the scale of the problem. The UNDP highlights that even highly informed young people often don’t know basic facts about gender‑based violence or global campaigns to address it. This is true in Utah. When people don’t see the scope, they don’t feel urgency. This lack of awareness is reinforced by the fact that gender‑based violence is chronically under‑measured, making the true scale difficult for the public to grasp. A 2025 scholarly review on the topic found that inconsistent data collection and narrow definitions of gender‑based violence lead to widespread underestimation of its prevalence, especially in institutional and community settings. Without accurate data, communities underestimate both the magnitude and the urgency of the crisis.
Fifth, cultural norms discourage speaking up. In many places — including Utah — cultural expectations around modesty, obedience, forgiveness, or family unity can discourage women from reporting violence and discourage communities from acknowledging it. A research synthesis found that social norms — especially silence, stigma, and normalization of abuse — are among the strongest barriers to community recognition of violence. Violence is often treated as a private matter rather than a collective concern, which reinforces the idea that speaking up is disloyal or disruptive. These norms don’t just suppress reporting; they actively shape how communities respond, often prioritizing reputation, harmony, or religious ideals over women’s safety.
Sixth, systems are not designed to respond well — and that leaves people feeling powerless. When survivors see that institutions fail to protect them, they learn that speaking up is risky. When bystanders see that institutions fail to hold perpetrators accountable, they learn that speaking up is futile. Even when laws exist, social norms and community resistance make it difficult to enforce protections or talk openly about violence. Communities often ignore or circumvent these laws because of entrenched gender norms, leaving activists to fight uphill battles just to get authorities and leaders to take violence against women seriously. Faced with such systemic failure, many people feel powerless; they avoid the topic because they don’t know what to do or fear that nothing they do will matter. Silence becomes the default.
The bottom-line is this: We owe women and girls more than quiet concern — we owe them action. That means speaking honestly, challenging harmful norms, and insisting that our systems protect those they were built to serve. Utah can do better, but only if we decide that silence is no longer an option.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102325_Domestic-Violence_05-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 18:59:33.401172

A reduction in the list of federally recommended childhood immunization has sparked alarm among public health experts. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)A federal government announcement this week dropping some vaccines from the list recommended for routine childhood immunization has drawn opposition from medical professionals nationwide and concern from the Wisconsin health department.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services is reviewing information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the change in vaccine recommendations “and is doing so with great concern for the health of children in our state,” Jennifer Miller, a DHS communications specialist, told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message Tuesday.
“Health professionals and parents deserve accurate, credible information,” Miller wrote. “We have not yet seen new scientific evidence that would justify changes to longstanding recommendations that have and continue to protect the health of children in the United States.”
The decision to stop recommending certain vaccines is “dangerous and unnecessary,” the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement posted Monday at the professional association’s website.
Among the diseases dropped from those recommended for routine immunization are hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), flu, and meningococcal disease.
“AAP continues to recommend that children be immunized against these diseases, and for good reason; thanks to widespread childhood immunizations, the United States has fewer pediatric hospitalizations and fewer children facing serious health challenges than we would without this community protection,” said Dr. Andrew Racine, AAP president, in the statement.
Miller said that DHS will continue its assessment of the CDC’s recommendation changes as well as those from “other trusted medical and public health agencies.” The department plans to issue more information on Thursday, she said.

October 10, 2023. (Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)A national support line for Native survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault has begun work to launch an Alaska-specific service. 
Strong Hearts Native Helpline is a Native-led nonprofit that offers 24-hour, seven-day-a-week support for anonymous and confidential calls from people who have experienced domestic violence or sexual assault. 
The line is staffed by Native advocates, but Strong Hearts Deputy Executive Officer Rachel Carr-Shunk said there are not yet any Alaska Native people answering phone calls.
That is set to change soon.

“Even though we’re a Native organization and all of our advocates are American Indian, we do recognize that there is a difference for our Alaska Native relatives who experience violence in that context, whether they live in a rural village or they just live in Alaska, which is a different experience,” she said.
Carr-Shunk expects the organization to launch the Alaska-specific line within the next calendar year, after building partnerships in the state. 
“When Alaska Native survivors reach out, we want them to trust that they’re going to have someone who understands their experience as an Alaska Native person, or who understands that identity,” she said.
To that end, the organization has hired Anchorage-based Minnie Sneddy, who is originally from Hooper Bay. Sneddy is tasked with explaining Alaska’s regional differences and specific needs to the organization, as well as helping create a database of Alaska resources. 
Sneddy has years of experience in behavioral health work and said that her career and life experience have shown her the lack of resources for people who face domestic violence and sexual assault — and how many of those people need mental health support.
“The years I lived in Hooper Bay, and here in Anchorage and Alaska, there’s so many (people) that need help and want help, but they feel like if they do come forward and get help, they get in trouble — not only with their families, but with OCS, Office of Children’s Services,” she said. “I feel like Strong Hearts Native Helpline can help at least allow a person to be heard, because the majority of time, people want to be heard. Everyone just wants to feel seen and be heard.”
Sneddy said she is reaching out to resources that already exist in the state, and Strong Hearts is working with the Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center to build out its state-specific service.
Alaska has the third-highest rate of intimate partner violence against women in the nation and men kill women in Alaska at a higher rate than anywhere else in the country. In a state where nearly half of women have experienced domestic violence in their lifetimes, Alaska Native women are particularly vulnerable.
“We don’t have a voice, really, in the villages,” Sneddy said, adding that when abuse happens: “There’s no help for an individual. And if a woman decides to do something about it, she’s seen as a bad person.”
The Strong Hearts Native Helpline is available now for Alaskans, even though there are not yet Alaska Native advocates on the other end of the line. A full list of Alaska shelters and victim’s services providers can be found in the state directory at law.alaska.gov.

Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, confirmed he is working on a school meals bill draft for possible consideration in the session that begins Jan. 21. Lawmakers rejected proposals for free school meals last year, but proponents are working to put a ballot measure before voters this November. 
Nathe said Wednesday it was too early to provide details of his proposal.

“These things take time,” Nathe said. “Hopefully, we’ll have something by the special session.”
The Together for School Meals coalition is gathering signatures for a constitutional ballot measure. If approved in a statewide vote, it would mandate the state provide free school meals to North Dakota K-12 students. 
Lawmakers began planning for the potential fiscal impact of the program last month, even before proponents began collecting signatures. The Department of Public Instruction estimates a free school meals program in North Dakota would cost about $134 million for a two-year budget cycle, but the cost estimate could change as the potential program continues to be studied. Nathe and other lawmakers expressed concerns about the sustainability of funding the program, which could grow by $6 million to $7 million every two years under preliminary estimates. 
House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, who has talked with Nathe about the proposal, said he prefers that policy issues involving spending be handled through a statute rather than added to the state constitution.
Free school meals bill fails in the North Dakota House

“Constitutionally-mandated spending doesn’t take into account potential increases and decreases in revenue, and it just ties your hands,” Lefor said. He added it would be easier for lawmakers to make changes to a law than an article in the state constitution.
It’s not yet clear if the topic will be discussed in the special session. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the special session to allocate $199 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding. 
Any bill that would be considered during the session must be advanced through Legislative Management, a bipartisan committee of legislative leaders, before it reaches the full Legislature. 
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, chair of Legislative Management, said Wednesday he feels the school meal issue was already addressed by state lawmakers.
“I’m not in favor of relitigating issues that were already heard and decided by the legislative assembly, in regular session, back in January through April,” Hogue said. 
If the bill comes before Legislative Management when the committee meets next Wednesday, Hogue said the committee will listen to the presentation and make a decision at that time.

Lefor, vice chair of Legislative Management, said he hopes to keep the session focused on the rural health funding.
“We’re going to want to be really tight with bills that get introduced simply because we have a three-day session,” he said. 
Lefor said he believes any bill that could be brought to the full Legislature outside of the rural health funding would need to be an emergency that can’t wait until the 2027 legislative session.
Legislative Council, the research arm of the Legislature, has received requests to prepare about 20 bill drafts for the special session, said Director John Bjornson. More information has not been made public. A bill draft request is not a public record unless a lawmaker chooses to disclose it. 
Lawmakers could choose to meet longer than three days. In October 2023, the most recent time the Legislature had a special session, lawmakers met for three days after the state Supreme Court invalidated the Office of Management and Budget bill approved earlier that year. Legislative Management chose to keep that session narrowly focused, rejecting many bill proposals except for a resolution of support for Israel.
Meanwhile, proponents of the ballot measure plan to continue to gather signatures, said Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot measure sponsoring committee.
“At this point, we are just forging forward,” she said. “It’s hard for us to comment on their plan without seeing the verbage.”
Nelson said funding school meals for students has widespread support across the state.
“I think it’s undeniable that our ballot initiative is motivating them to take action now,” she said.

Michelle Lujan Grisham's ask for what she says it will take to fund universal childcare. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM).State legislative leaders on Wednesday released a budget proposal that fails to fully fund one of outgoing New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s signature policies: universal child care for families with young children. 
The governor announced last September that the state would eliminate income requirements for families to receive waivers for their portions — copayments — of child care costs. Previously, only families that earned less than 400% of the federal poverty level received copay waivers. 
In enacting that change, New Mexico became the first state in the nation to offer free universal childcare.
The state Early Childhood Education and Care Department officially launched the program in November. Last month, Lujan Grisham’s office released a budget proposal that includes $163.2 million from the state’s recurring general fund to keep the program running through July 2027. That represents a 54.1% increase from the previous year.
NM Governor’s office proposes $11.3B state budget and increased spending

 
But in a news conference Wednesday at the Roundhouse, legislative leaders released their own budget proposal, which only increases ECECD’s appropriations from the general fund by $13.7 million, or 4.5%. They also reiterated that while New Mexico is in healthy financial shape compared with other states, market conditions and other indicators point toward more fiscal restraint in the upcoming year. 
In detailed budget proposal documents from the Legislative Finance Committee, which drafted the proposal, analysts predict that universal free childcare will “create additional demand for Childcare Assistance without the necessary revenues to implement this policy decision should more people apply and qualify for subsidies.”
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, also noted Lujan Grisham’s budget proposal includes spending that exceeds her second and final term in office, which ends Dec. 31 of this year. 
New Mexico governor announces free universal child care

“This governor is trying to spend into the next administration’s money,” Muñoz said at the news conference. 
An ECECD program analysis shows costs for universal child care increasing for several years — funding for which would mostly come from state coffers — from a little over $445 million this fiscal year to nearly $730 million by fiscal year 2029. 
LFC Chair Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces) told Source New Mexico on Wednesday that “all options are on the table” when it comes to reaching a compromise with the governor on one of her signature policies. 
He expects the Legislature and the governor to “work closely” in search of other funding sources or a “prioritization system” that ensures those who most need childcare get it as the program builds additional capacity and hires more childcare providers. 
“I want to emphasize that this is a start and that a great deal of the work is to come during the session,” he said.
He defended the Legislature’s funding proposal as prudent in the face of a worsening economy, while also maintaining funding for childcare subsidies for those “those who need it most.” 
“In a year where we have more pressures, more storm clouds, economically and otherwise on the horizon, and less money coming in…we have to be very focused on sustainability,” he said. “You know, two and three and four and more years from now, what this could look like.”
New Mexico lawmakers to tackle reduced spending in the new year’s budget

The governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman told Source in an emailed statement that the governor was “disappointed” by the Legislature’s proposal.
“Governor Lujan Grisham is disappointed by the LFC’s early childhood budget proposal, but she is not surprised—and she is not deterred,” he said. “Executive and legislative budgets are rarely aligned initially. The Governor is confident the Legislature will fund universal childcare at levels that match the public’s strong support for this historic initiative.”
Small said at the news conference Wednesday changes contained in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed last year created “national headwinds,” along with other factors outside the state’s control, that spell the end of a multi-year streak of sharply growing state budgets. 
To that end, the LFC’s budget’s recommendation calls for spending $11.1 billion from the state’s general fund, a 2.5%, or $268 million, increase over FY26 planned spending.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on Jan. 7, 2026.
Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield on Wednesday announced she is running for a second term.
In a campaign launch video, the Republican says she is focused on getting education “back to the basics.” She touted the state’s gains in career readiness during her tenure and the highest graduation rate in 10 years. Elementary literacy has improved under a renewed push for phonics instruction. Critchfield has also helped ensure parents are key stakeholder in their kids’ education.
“I remain committed to clear, practical priorities, responsible use of taxpayer dollars and supporting local schools as they meet the unique needs of their communities,” Critchfield said in the video. “We’ve made real progress, but there’s still important work ahead.”
Critchfield was elected in 2022 to a four-year term as the state’s top public education official. She previously served as a Cassia County School District trustee for 10 years and seven years as a member of the Idaho State Board of Education. She lives in Oakley with her husband, where they raised four children.
In her first three years, Critchfield has shown mixed legislative results with success in some areas but no movement on updating the K-12 funding formula, which hasn’t changed since 1994.
In 2023, she helped pass three bills through the Idaho Legislature, including her signature initiative, the Idaho Career Ready Students Program. With an initial investment of $45 million, the program funds career and technical education in grades seven through 12.
“From reading proficiency to career pathways and real-world readiness, we are focused on results that matter to Idaho families,” Critchfield said in a news release. “Our students deserve an education that prepares them not just to graduate but to build a strong future.”
Also in her first year, she passed House Bill 92 to require high schools to teach a financial literacy class and House Bill 163 to reinforce parental rights in education. Another bill she supported that outlined training requirements for school trustees failed.
In 2024, Critchfield succeeded in one of three of her priorities. She helped secure $145 million for school districts to fill a hole left by a shift to attendance-based funding. But two bills — House Bill 595 and House Bill 718 — that would have changed Idaho’s school funding formula failed.
She faced more challenges on that front during the 2025 session.
Critchfield supported a funding formula with different weights for special education students, English language learners, economically disadvantaged students and kids who attend rural schools. Senate Bill 1096 passed in the Senate but was never heard in the House. Another bill that would have created a $3 million high-needs student fund to help kids with disabilities passed in the House but died in the Senate. 
Her staff last year also proposed changes to Idaho’s graduation requirements, but Legislators pared down the proposal and created a new high school digital literacy class requirement, which will go into effect in 2028.
For this year’s session, which begins Monday, Critchfield has already walked back her top legislative priority. She proposed in August a $50 million investment in special education but pulled the request last month due to the state’s budget shortfall.
“We want to be careful, we want to be deliberate in what we ask,” Critchfield told State Board of Education members in December. “The first priority for me is to maintain current budget levels.”
 No election challengers yet

Critchfield does not appear to have any challengers within her own party or from the Democrats. She’s the only state superintendent candidate to file financial forms with the secretary of state, which is a precursor to running. But Idaho Democrats are prioritizing a challenger. Party Chair Lauren Necochea told EdNews last month that getting a Democrat in the race by the end of January would give them “enough runway.” 
“It’s the statewide office we’ve held most recently as a party,” Necochea said. “It’s the race that we’ve come the closest to winning statewide in recent cycles.”
Critchfield’s campaign has raised $72,000 for the 2026 election cycle, including a $5,000 contribution from Micron Technology.
 The filing period to run for office in Idaho is Feb. 23-27. The primary election is May 19 and the general election is Nov. 3.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Back in early December, when Ole Miss had just promoted Pete Golding to head coach, I received a text message from a friend, a prominent Rebel alum, fan and donor. No, I won’t name him because he did not intend the message for public consumption.
But trust me, 99% of readers would recognize the name.
Rick Cleveland
My friend said he was “deeply troubled” by the hire. He called Golding “a scruffy-looking man with no head coaching experience who was let go as defensive coordinator by Nick Saban at Alabama.”
The writer said the Ole Miss defense had been average during the regular season against a relatively easy SEC schedule. Of Golding’s hire, he concluded: “I don’t like it a bit.”
Well, I did like the hire and wrote as much. This much I knew: Golding, a straight-shooting, down-to-earth guy, would be a refreshing change from his predecessor. But I also wrote that time would tell, that the biggest adjustment in sports was the promotion from assistant coach to head coach. There’s so much involved. Some can handle it, some can’t. 
Now then, here we are just over a month later at the Fiesta Bowl, the national championship semifinals. Granted, we are only one month into Golding’s head coaching career, but’s let’s assess. Here’s my Pete Golding report card:

Game management: A-plus. Ole Miss blew out Tulane, as expected, and then knocked off Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. The Rebels made offensive and defensive adjustments at halftime that were critical to victory.
Roster retention: A-plus-plus. Not only as Golding dealt with game preparation and hiring a staff, but in this insane era of college football, he has had to deal with the transfer portal and the potential loss of many of his best players. So far, he has lost only his back-up quarterback. Here lately, many of the Rebels’ best players (Trinidad Chambliss, Kewan Lacy, Lucas Carneiro, Suntarine Perkins, Will Echoles, Antonio Kite and others) have announced intentions to return. 
Dealing with the media: Another high A. Golding looks you in the eye and tells you what he thinks. He’s genuine. Yeah, he cusses some. So do I. So do most of us. As Golding has said, “Shit, I’m working on it.”
Gets along with others: A solid A. Ask his players, ask his coaches, ask his bosses, ask the equipment guys. They swear by him.
Recruiting: A. Nobody has ever questioned Golding’s recruiting ability. Besides retaining so many of the Rebels’ best players, Golding has Ole Miss easily in the top 10 nationally with the current transfer portal class. The Rebels have attracted players from LSU, Auburn, Florida and elsewhere.
Cussing: A big C. But, shit, he’s working on it.
Appearance: Another A. Amazing what a fresh haircut, a beard trim and new duds will do for you. Golding looked positively suave in his stylish navy blue suit Wednesday. He even wore a tie.

But don’t be fooled. A spiffed-up appearance has not changed who Golding is. “Pete’s Pete,” defensive coach Bryan Brown says. “He’s not gonna change. What you see is what you get.”
The following exchange from a Wednesday press conference will tell you much about Golding. 
Questioner: “What message do you have for Lane Kiffin and all those who maybe had given up or lost hope (after Kiffin left)?”
Golding: “I don’t have a message for anybody else. I think our team had a message. They had a message about how they prepared and how they play and that they weren’t tired of playing. I do think the message is: I’m replaceable. You’re replaceable. Our players are replaceable. I think you want to build a program to where it’s heading in the right direction. One person, one player, anything like that, that’s not going to derail that. There’s been too much invested in that; and it’s been aligned correctly, that one person is not going to impact something so drastically. If it is, it’s probably not built right, right? I
“If one coach in any sport can determine the outcome of it, he probably doesn’t have a very good staff, right? If one player can determine the outcome of it, we probably didn’t recruit and create the right depth. Or we didn’t prepare him to be ready for his opportunity. It’s a team game. There’s so many people that go into it. The timing of when it happened, in my opinion, couldn’t have happened at a better time for the players, because everything was already in place. Everything was on the track.
“It’s headed in the right direction. We have got really good players. There’s already a culture created. They knew the expectation. The only thing that was different is who is running them out of the tunnel. And to be honest with you, I don’t think the players give a damn who runs them out of the tunnel. Does that make sense? They care about their plan. They care about being held accountable and how they’re going to prepare. They care about people that care about them. I think that’s been the message our players have created. I don’t have shit to say to anybody else.”
Golding always deflects credit to his players and his staff – and even to the Ole Miss administration and supporters. If his predecessor was a narcissistic diva (and I wrote that he is), Golding is a polar opposite.

So, Wednesday morning, I reached back out to the prominent Ole Miss alum and donor who had been so troubled by Golding’s hiring just over a month ago.
What do you think now, I asked.
“Well, so far he’s proved me wrong,” he wrote back. “I don’t think anyone else could have put us in the advantageous spot we now find ourselves, what with excellent portal and high school recruiting, not to mention the national semifinals. And the players and the national press corps seem to love the man. Who am I to argue with success.”
Again, we are just over a month into Golding’s head coaching career. A lot could change. But, for Pete’s sake, the early returns are simply smashing.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01212644/AP26002107624483.jpg,,,2026-01-07 18:59:33.401172

(Photo: Adobe file)The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is not planning to change its 2015 list of recommended vaccinations for children up to 18.
On Jan. 5, the CDC announced changes to its recommendations for vaccines for children and adolescents, cutting the list from 17 to 11. Vaccines for RSV, hepatitis A and B, meningitis, COVID, rotavirus, and influenza are now recommended only for certain high-risk populations or after discussion with a doctor or nurse.
In its announcement, the CDC said the United States is a “global outlier” among developed countries for the number of vaccines it recommends.
“There is a need for more and better gold standard science, including placebo-controlled randomized trials and long-term observational studies to better characterize vaccine benefits, risks, and outcomes,” the agency said.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, N.C. Division of Public Health director Dr. Kelly Kimple said the new CDC list is still similar to the state’s, including vaccines for measles, polio, chickenpox, tetanus, whooping cough and other diseases.
But Kimple said the state will follow the lead of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is also declining to change its vaccine recommendations. She stressed that the AAP’s recommendations are “evidence-based.”
“I know that these changes are causing confusion, and we want to ensure people have clear, reliable information,” Kimple said. “The scientific evidence around the vaccines has not changed. These vaccines are safe and effective to prevent serious illness and death.”
“The important point to take away is that we continue to have vaccines available and covered by insurance to keep our kids, families and communities healthy and safe,” Kimple added.
State health officials also strongly urged North Carolinians to get a flu shot if they have not already, and to make sure their families’ MMR vaccines are up to date, especially if they’re traveling to an area with a known outbreak of measles.
Three siblings in Buncombe County have been diagnosed with measles after the family traveled to Spartanburg, South Carolina, where measles is currently spreading.
Dr. Erica Wilson with DHHS said the infected children had had one of their MMR series, but could not say if they were fully vaccinated. Another case of measles in Polk County is also believed to be connected to travel to South Carolina.
According to Kimple, a 2024 analysis found that childhood vaccines prevented around 508 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations, and more than 1.1 million premature deaths for U.S. children between 1994 and 2023. These estimates don’t include flu, COVID and RSV vaccines, she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AdobeStock-Vaccine-Equity.jpg,,,2026-01-07 18:12:23.464615

As Congress looks to create an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, or bow to pressure from constituents who will lose access to health care en masse by extending the premium tax credits that lapsed last month, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she will continue the fight to do the latter.
Tlaib (D-Detroit) discussed the lapsed ACA tax credits in a press call hosted by Protect Our Care Michigan, which also featured Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters and Michigan League for Public Policy Senior Policy Analyst Amber Bellazaire.
The congresswoman continued to express her outrage at the U.S. House and Senate letting the subsidies lapse, and gave an update on how she and her Democratic colleagues are fighting back — which includes a forced floor vote set to take place on Thursday.
The federal subsidies in question were not renewed in President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last year. 
Tlaib said the act didn’t just tear away health care for tens of millions residents, but also cut Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion, which is a primary way that the nation helps pay for long-term care.
On the Michigan front, more than 531,000 Michiganders buy their health care through the ACA. 

The ACA open enrollment period to purchase health insurance closes on Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, Protect Our Care Michigan has noted, and residents who buy health care through the ACA will be forced to pay $710 more each year on average for their health insurance. 
Roughly 390,000 Michiganders stand to lose their health care coverage due to premium increases in the bill that slashed $1.1 trillion from Medicaid. 
“Over 40% of births in Michigan are paid through Medicaid,” Tlaib said. “So as we’re fighting for Black maternal health to reduce infant mortality. We know how critically important it is to have access to health care coverage.”
She noted an anecdote from a constituent who told her that it wasn’t accurate to call America’s health system “health care” any longer, and that it was more akin to “sick care,” because the nation no longer prioritizes access to quality care. Tlaib said that was a basic right that has been shoved to the wayside in favor of Trump’s other priorities.
“I continue to remind people that if it was really about the money, Trump found money to bomb Venezuela, right? But he refuses to fund health care for Americans, many of which, again, are already sick,” she said. “The folks coming to testify at our press conferences here on the Hill and the Capitol steps talk about the fact that they have cancer now they can’t stop having cancer involved, and their care is interrupted because of the fact that we have not extended … the Affordable Care Act tax credits.”
Overall, Tlaib said she believes the American people do not want a bigger Pentagon budget, they want reasonable access to a doctor, and better yet, Medicare for all.

Tlaib said Democrats have zeroed in on one way to effectively fight back: a discharge petition that was jumpstarted in December, which forced a vote on the House floor expected Thursday.
Tlaib said it was a way to get around the Republican majority.
“If we can get 218 members of the House to sign it, then we can force a vote onto the floor,” Tlaib said. “Well, we got 218 signatures. We reached that, so now we’re going to be able to vote on it tomorrow. Democrats and at least four House Republicans will force a vote for a three-year tax credit extension for the Affordable Care Act.”
Tlaib asked constituents to continue to call their representatives to urge them to vote in favor of the extension, but said they didn’t need to call her, because she knows where she stands.
“I’m good to go. I signed that petition early on, but Republicans are breaking ranks right now because they are hearing directly from many of you and the constituents and what is at stake,” Tlaib said. “We must organize to pass this legislation tomorrow and put pressure on the Senate to take it up. Refuse to accept the status quo that treats health care as a privilege instead of a right. Lives are at stake right now.”
Waters and Bellazaire addressed the toll the lapsed credits may soon have on Michiganders if they aren’t extended this week or soon.
“No American should be forced to choose between getting the care they need to stay alive and losing their home and life savings to pay for cancer treatment,” said Waters, a cancer survivor. “President Trump and Republicans in Congress have a duty to put people’s health and safety first and foremost. Middle-class Michiganders will bear the burden of skyrocketing costs while billionaires get unfair tax breaks. Detroiters and all other Michiganders can’t afford higher costs on their health care premiums.”
Bellazaire said Congress has the opportunity to do the right thing this week.
“Renewing the enhanced premium tax credits would provide stability for the ACA marketplace, help families and small businesses manage rising costs, and ensure people can continue accessing the care they rely on,” Bellazaire said.

,DC,2026-01-07 22:57:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Dems demand investigation of fatal Minneapolis ICE shooting as Trump claims self-defense,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dems-demand-investigation-fatal-minneapolis-ice-shooting-trump-claims-self-defense,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump defended a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis Wednesday, while congressional Democrats universally condemned the action.Video obtained by the Minnesota Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding the driver of a maroon SUV get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting. But Trump wrote on social media that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” Trump wrote.Minnesota’s Democratic congressional delegation, and other Democrats in Washington, D.C., strongly condemned the incident and questioned the subsequent comments from the administration. “We need full transparency and an investigation of what happened, and I am deeply concerned that statements made by DHS do not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts,” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the state’s senior senator, said in a statement.  Local officials have not identified the victim, but she was reportedly 37. A photo of the SUV shows several stuffed animals hanging out of the glove compartment.Trump, GOP back officerCongressional Republicans largely backed Trump’s version of events, calling the shooting self-defense and blaming Democrats for rhetoric they said inspired violence.Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the woman tried to run over the agent.“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” McLaughlin said. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the victim a “domestic terrorist.” House Republican Whip Tom Emmer gave his support to the ICE officer.“Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals,” he said in a statement. “May God bless and protect them in their efforts. Shame on the elected officials who endanger these agents by spewing lies and hateful rhetoric.”Dems call for investigationDemocrats on Capitol Hill denounced the attack and the administration’s response.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for the ICE officer who shot the woman to be criminally investigated. “There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing,” Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life.”Minnesota Democrats said the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities had heightened tensions.“For weeks, Donald Trump has directed ICE and DHS agents to racially profile and arrest Minnesotans in their homes, their workplaces, and on our streets,” Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said in a statement, adding that more than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in the state. “Trump’s reckless and dangerous immigration policies do nothing to make us safer,” she continued. “Today in Minneapolis, these actions resulted in a masked federal agent fatally shooting a woman in the head.”Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said the woman fatally shot by an ICE officer was a U.S. citizen. She called for ICE to leave Minnesota. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress and whose district includes the site of the shooting, said the woman was a legal observer, which is a neutral third party who attends protests or other public demonstrations to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.“ICE’s actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible,” Omar said.DHS practices, budget questionedDHS received billions for immigration enforcement in last year's tax and spending cuts package passed by congressional Republicans. The funding can be used for hiring new ICE officers and detention and removal of immigrants. On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, doubling from 10,000 agents to 22,000.A top Senate Democratic appropriator, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, wrote on social media that “Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn’t restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency.” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement that he was concerned the aggressive DHS practices will lead to more tragedies. “All evidence indicates that hiring standards have been lowered, training is inadequate, and internal controls are insufficient,” he said. “These conditions have allowed agents to operate without proper oversight, and, in some cases, unlawfully.” Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego also criticized the hiring practices of ICE, specifically calling out White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy.  “What happened is a disgrace and we need an investigation immediately,” Gallego said on social media. “It's clear that that agent didn't have the proper training, and that's because Stephen Miller is going full speed ahead to hire as many agents as possible.”Day care investigationThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis began last month but intensified this week after a right-wing influencer reported day care centers run by members of the Somali community as fraudulent. In response, the Trump administration directed states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers and Noem has zeroed in on the city, which has a large Somali community, for immigration enforcement. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a Wednesday hearing on the issue of fraud in Minnesota.",,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

(Foto de Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Un agente del ICE disparó mortalmente a una mujer que conducía un SUV a través de la ventanilla de su coche en el sur de Minneapolis el miércoles por la mañana.
El vídeo del incidente compartido con The Reformer muestra agentes enmascarados de ICE acercándose a un Honda Pilot detenido en medio de Portland Avenue, cerca de la calle 34. Un agente le dice al conductor que “salga del maldito coche” e intenta abrir la puerta. El conductor retrocede lentamente y avanza, pareciendo que intenta salir. Un agente que va delante del vehículo dispara tres veces y el SUV recorre una corta distancia antes de chocar contra un coche aparcado.
La mujer fue trasladada al Centro Médico del Condado de Hennepin, donde fue declarada muerta, según el jefe de policía de Minneapolis. La identidad de la mujer aún no ha sido revelada, solo que tenía 37 años, según el alcalde de Minneapolis.
Tricia McLaughlin, subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, escribiendo en X, dio una versión diferente de lo ocurrido: “Uno de estos alborotadores violentos convirtió su vehículo en arma, intentando atropellar a nuestros agentes de la ley en un intento de matarlos: un acto de terrorismo doméstico. Un agente de ICE, temiendo por su vida, la de sus compañeros de policía y la seguridad del público, disparó tiros defensivos.”
La testigo que grabó el vídeo, Caitlin Callenson, dijo que estaba paseando cuando vio un vehículo de combustión interna atascado en la nieve. A medida que llegaban más vehículos de combustión interna, los transeúntes silbataban en señal de protesta y el conductor del SUV intentaba bloquear los vehículos de combustión interna.
Callenson dijo que no vio agentes de ICE intentando detener a nadie antes o después del tiroteo.
Después de que se dispararon los disparos, el conductor “quedó completamente desplomado dentro del vehículo”, dijo Emily Heller, otra testigo.
Los agentes federales no permitirían que un hombre que decía ser médico examinara al conductor, dijo Heller. Los técnicos de emergencia médica llegaron 15 minutos después, dijo. Los primeros intervinientes no pudieron acercarse al lugar porque los agentes de ICE no movieron sus coches para dejarles pasar.
“Hubo caos y ambulancias y camiones de bomberos no pudieron pasar”, dijo Callenson. “Tuvieron que recorrer todos los vehículos ICE a pie para intentar administrar primeros auxilios.”
El alcalde de Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, dijo que temía este momento desde que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional comenzó a intensificar la aplicación de la ley migratoria en las Ciudades Gemelas en las últimas semanas, enviando miles de agentes al estado en lo que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional califica como su “mayor operación hasta la fecha”.
Frey calificó el informe de ICE, que dijo que el tiroteo fue en defensa propia, de “tonterías” y criticó duramente la presencia de la agencia en la ciudad, afirmando que solo “están causando caos y desconfianza”.
“A ICE, lárgate de Minneapolis”, dijo Frey.
Instó a los residentes a mantener la paz y a no “caer en el anzuelo” del gobierno federal.
“Quieren que respondamos de una manera que cree una ocupación militar en nuestra ciudad”, dijo Frey. “No dejemos que lo hagan.”
Decenas de agentes federales de ICE y del FBI, así como agentes de policía de Minneapolis y agentes del sheriff del condado de Hennepin, acudieron al lugar.
Mientras los agentes de ICE abandonaban el lugar, el enfrentamiento entre las fuerzas del orden y los manifestantes continuaba.
Cuando algunos agentes federales intentaron marcharse, los manifestantes bloquearon sus vehículos. Los agentes dispararon un gas nocivo a corta distancia, causando angustia y vómitos en muchos manifestantes y periodistas
Los manifestantes lanzaron insultos a los agentes de policía de Minneapolis, que no deberían ayudar en la aplicación de la ley migratoria, pero que estaban en el lugar el miércoles por la mañana.
Después de que las fuerzas del orden desalojaran el lugar, los manifestantes colocaron rosas blancas donde la sangre manchaba la nieve.

Miembros del Ayuntamiento, entre ellos Robin Wonsley y Jamal Osman, se dirigieron a la multitud, diciendo que la zona era una escena activa del crimen y que la policía de MPD estaba presente para investigar.
El jefe de policía de Minneapolis, Brian O’Hara, dijo en una rueda de prensa el miércoles que aún no han visto información que indique que el tiroteo estuviera justificado y que no hay nada que indique que la mujer fuera objetivo de actividades de aplicación de la ley migratoria, según O’Hara.
Los agentes de policía de Minneapolis aseguraron la escena del crimen para preservar pruebas, dijo O’Hara. La Oficina Federal de Investigaciones está llevando a cabo conjuntamente una investigación sobre el uso de la fuerza letal con la Oficina de Detención Criminal de Minnesota.
La sheriff del condado de Hennepin, Dawanna Witt, subrayó la necesidad de la implicación local en la investigación para garantizar la transparencia: “Con todo respeto al nivel federal, debemos asegurarnos de que nuestras agencias locales estén implicadas.”
La fiscal del condado de Hennepin, Mary Moriarty, emitió un comunicado poco después del tiroteo diciendo: “Presionando con fuerza para una investigación local, que es la única forma de garantizar total transparencia y revisión por parte de nuestra oficina.”
La representante estadounidense Betty McCollum, demócrata de St. Paul, pidió a la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, que se filmara observando las acciones de ICE en Minneapolis el martes, para que detuviera inmediatamente la operación de ICE “para restaurar el orden y prevenir más lesiones”.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7010-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Many still fear future restrictions on access and are working with the Legislature to safeguard Vermont’s ability to buy and administer the vaccines to those who want and need them.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scaled back federal guidelines for childhood vaccines Monday, moving six immunizations out of the “recommended” category. Following the federal action, Vermont officials and health experts are reaffirming the state’s commitment to its existing childhood immunization schedule, which recommends many of the vaccines that the CDC had removed.
The vaccines for flu, RSV, meningococcal disease and hepatitis A and B were among the vaccines removed from the federal recommended category. In Vermont, they remain recommended or required for child care or school attendance.
The move is the latest in a series of efforts led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is an outspoken skeptic of vaccines, to move away from established medical science on immunization.

“In Vermont, vaccine policy will continue to be guided by scientific evidence and informed by trusted medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics,” state Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant wrote in a statement Tuesday. 
“As always, we encourage families to consult trusted health care professionals when making decisions about their children’s health, including their pediatrician, school nurse, or local pharmacist. We also urge caution when sharing or acting on unverified or misleading health information,” his statement continued. 
On Tuesday, he appeared before the Vermont House of Representatives’ Committee on Human Services to address the federal change and to testify about a proposed state bill that aims to protect access to vaccines for those who want and need them in Vermont. 
Hildebrant confirmed to lawmakers that the cost of and access to childhood vaccines has not changed with the federal recommendation shift — insurers are still required to cover the costs of these vaccines. But the Health Department is still taking steps to prepare for a future where that is no longer the case as federal policy under President Donald Trump’s administration continues to change.
“We are very concerned about what this could look like in the future,” he said, adding that he worries this change is “setting the stage” for more drastic restrictions on access to vaccines. 
He said the Health Department is working to proactively safeguard vaccine access in Vermont. The proposed bill H.545 is one path it is taking to do so. 
Currently, the state buys vaccines from the CDC, which buys the vaccines from manufacturers in bulk and is able to offer lower prices. Yet, earlier in the fall, this reliance on the federal body led to delays in the state’s ability to procure the Covid-19 vaccines.
The bill also includes clearer guidelines for the state’s immunization recommendation processes, relying on a committee of local experts, not just federal vaccine panels. It adds details to ensure insurers will continue covering the cost of vaccination and to offer legal immunity for providers who administer the vaccines in good faith, following broadly agreed upon medical science. 
Tracy Tyson is a pediatrician and the president-elect of Vermont’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She told lawmakers in Tuesday’s hearing that her organization sees Vermont as setting an important example by solidifying its own state vaccine schedule separate from federal recommendations.
Those at American Academy of Pediatrics “see Vermont as a trailblazer in protecting the relationship between public health, its providers and its patients,” she said. 
She still worries there is serious harm in the current landscape of shifting federal guidelines. Even though children can still get the vaccines and insurance will cover them, the confusion that many parents face about what protections their child should receive and when is dangerous, she said. It hinders “true, informed consent,” Tyson told lawmakers. 
“It may seem like it’s giving more autonomy to families, but what it’s giving is more confusion, and that is going to lead to more lapses in care,” she said of the altered vaccine schedule.  
Many health care providers across the state have echoed the state Health Department in reaffirming the safety of the previous CDC vaccine schedule.
“This schedule is grounded in rigorous science and the expertise of immunologists, infectious disease specialists, and public health professionals,” Dartmouth Health Children’s chief physician Keith Loud wrote in a statement, referring to the previous guidelines. The children’s hospital will continue to root its recommendations in the American Academy of Pediatrics schedule. 
The Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Vermont Academy of Family Physicians and the Vermont Medical Society issued a joint statement echoing the importance of these vaccines. 
They are important not only for children’s health, Hildebrandt added in his address to the House committee, but it is also a massive cost-saving tool for the health care system. 
“The reason we use vaccines is to prevent expensive and deadly illnesses,” he said, giving the example of a $10 flu shot that could prevent a child from landing in the emergency room or intensive care unit, wracking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills. 
“The data on vaccines is a slam dunk. These are cost saving, not cost generating,” he said.

Why his case shows new legal obstacles for immigrants,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/san-diego-immigration-release-courts/,"An immigration judge granted Idris Demirtas' release from detention, but that wasn't enough to reunite him with his wife in San Diego.","In summary
An immigration judge granted Idris Demirtas’ release from detention, but that wasn’t enough to reunite him with his wife in San Diego. 


A Turkish immigrant who fled his country after being tortured is now home with his wife in San Diego after being held for about seven weeks by U.S. authorities. 
Idris Demirtas, 25, was released only after a federal judge in the Southern District of California granted a habeas corpus petition finding that his detention was unjustified. An immigration judge issued a decision in Demirtas’ favor a week earlier, but she made the ruling contingent on a federal court process. 
His arrest at a routine immigration check-in and his 48-day detention reflected some of the Trump administration’s hardline enforcement tactics since the Republican took office a year ago pledging to deport 1 million people per year.
“I did grow a lot through this process, but we lost a lot emotionally and mentally,” said Mae Bovenzi, Demirtas’ wife. “I hope both of our mental health goes back to normal. I feel like we’ve been so misinformed and I’ve seen the constitutional rights that are being stripped away right in front of my eyes.” 
The couple, who married in May, missed their first holiday season together because of the ordeal but they plan to “celebrate in their own way now,” his wife said. She added she was grateful for all the support her family received.
“My body didn’t want to go to sleep last night because I’m afraid I’ll dream I’m back there in jail,” Demirtas said about his first night home.  
Demirtas was arrested on Nov. 20 when he complied with an order to appear at a routine ICE check-in in San Diego at the downtown federal Edward Schwartz courthouse. 
He was among hundreds who were arrested in California last year while appearing at immigration check-ins or court hearings. His background would have made his detention improbable during the Biden administration. He is married to a U.S. citizen and has a pending green card application. He does not have any criminal history, a Department of Homeland Security attorney confirmed during a bond hearing last week. He’s from a country with a human rights record that the State Department has criticized and he arrived in the United States after fleeing religious persecution. He said in court filings he was tortured in Turkey because of his religious beliefs.
Despite that background, and an immigration judge ruling he could be released on bond on Dec. 30, Demirtas remained detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center until the district judge granted his habeas petition and he was released Tuesday night. 
Attorneys are increasingly turning to federal courts to secure their clients’ release because of disruptions to the immigration court system. The Trump administration has fired more than 100 immigration judges nationwide, according to the National Association of Immigration Judges. 
In California, more than a quarter of federal immigration judges have been fired, retired or quit since Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.  In San Francisco, at least 12 immigration judges have been fired or left without clear explanations, exacerbating a 100,000-case backlog in the region it covers. 
A spokesperson for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the courts, said her office declines to comment on personnel matters.
‘Unforgiving system’
In July 2025, the Trump administration issued a directive that required mandatory detention for almost all noncitizens who entered the United States without authorization. 
“Based on how unforgiving the immigration system is right now, great people are just giving up,” said Matthew Holt, Demirtas’ immigration attorney. “It’s sad to see it after the generational sacrifices they’ve made.”
Holt and other attorneys have said the new system of detaining more people, and not letting them out on bond or parole is like a “war of attrition,” a military strategy where one side wears the other down by exhausting their resources and morale.
In September, some 7,079 immigration court cases nationwide ended with a voluntary departure, which allows a person to leave the country within a certain time frame and usually carries less penalties than a deportation order. That’s the highest number ever recorded in a single month, according to data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which holds information on cases going back to 1997. For cases in California, that total was 408. 
“I personally have experienced people with meritorious claims, or what could be meritorious claims, before the hearing, before their testimony, say, ‘I want an order of removal. I want to leave. I can’t take it anymore,'” said Jeremiah Johnson, a former immigration judge in San Francisco, who was fired on Nov. 21 by email without explanation. 
Federal judges rule against detention
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment. Previously, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stressed that Demirtas had entered the country illegally. 
“To be clear, having a pending application with USCIS or the possibility of being eligible for a green card does not grant anyone legal status,” McLaughlin said about the case. 
A Department of Homeland Security budget document from 2024 says it costs on average $217 per day for ICE to detain someone in San Diego, meaning U.S. taxpayers paid about $10,416 for Demirtas to be detained before the agency finally agreed to release him. 
Before President Donald Trump’s second term, the federal lawsuits known as “habeas corpus” were not regularly used in immigration cases. “Habeas corpus” is the constitutional right that ensures that people have a chance to challenge their imprisonment in front of a judge.
In 2025, hundreds of habeas cases were filed in the Southern District of California, and thousands were filed for detained immigrants across the country. So far in 2026, about a dozen such cases have already been filed in the Southern District of California, according to habeasdockets.org, a site that tracks such filings. 
Federal judges have been systematically rejecting Trump’s policy of mandatory detention. In one recent filing in the Southern District of New York, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan noted noncitizens have won their habeas petitions in 350 of 362 cases in federal district courts. He wrote that “160 different judges sitting in about 50 different courts spread across the United States” handed down the rulings.
New postings for ‘deportation judges’
Immigration courts operate underneath the executive branch, not the independent judicial branch that oversees federal courts. The courts are housed under the Justice Department, which gives the Trump administration more authority over immigration judges. Unlike in criminal courts, attorneys are not appointed for those who cannot afford legal representation.
The Department of Justice recently began advertising open positions for “deportation judges,” particularly for employees located in San Francisco, Santa Ana, Sacramento and Los Angeles where applicants are invited to “combat fraud and ensure those seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in our immigration system are not successful.” 
A Department of Justice spokesperson said the effort was aimed at “restoring integrity to our immigration system.” 
“After four years of the Biden Administration forcing immigration courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety,” she wrote in an emailed statement. 
The Trump administration has also temporarily assigned military lawyers to act as judges in immigration cases, which some experts say could violate posse comitatus, the 19th Century law that defines what the military can do on U.S. soil.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010525-Idris-Demirtas-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Walker, R-Columbus, had announced last summer that he wouldn’t seek reelection to the Senate seat he first won in 2006 but on Wednesday filed for another term on the first day of the candidacy filing period.
Walker told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that “circumstances are different” from when he previously decided to not run again.
“I felt like it was important for me to continue to stand for Indiana issues instead of Washington politics,” Walker said in an interview. “We’ve seen just a small taste of what federalization of Indiana elections could look like, and may eventually look more like than they do today, and I’m greatly concerned when I see Hoosier politics play a surrogate to those national battles.” 
Walker was a vocal Republican critic of the redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump — and was one of several lawmakers who faced swatting or other intimidation tactics ahead of the Senate’s vote last month against redrawing the congressional maps.
Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, is among the Republicans who had announced bids to succeed Walker in Senate District 41, which includes all of Bartholomew County and much of Johnson County south of Indianapolis.
Davis, who voted in favor of the redistricting plan when it passed the House, said Wednesday she was continuing her Senate campaign.

“It does not affect me one bit,” Davis told the Capital Chronicle. “I’ve worked really hard, spent a lot of time in both Johnson County and Bartholomew County, gaining support, holding fundraisers and showing up at events. I am full-force steam ahead.”
Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and pro-redistricting groups have said they would support primary challengers to Republican legislators who didn’t support the proposed new maps that sought a 9-0 GOP Indiana congressional delegation by carving up the two districts now held by Democrats.
Walker said he didn’t know how redistricting supporters might try to insert themselves into his race.
“I’ve seen a lot of implied or explicit threats or implied or explicit rewards, but I don’t see a lot of evidence on follow through from outside forces,” Walker said.
Walker delivered more than 20 minutes of emotional remarks during a December committee hearing on the redistricting bill — at one point moved to tears — explaining why he could not support it.
“I fear for this institution … if we allow intimidation and threats to be the norm,” he said. “I refuse to be intimidated. I will not normalize that kind of behavior.”
Walker has broken from other Republican senators on some prominent issues in recent years, such as voting against the 2022 bill that revoked Indiana’s handgun permit requirement and last year’s bill allowing partisan school board elections.
He also voted against a 2022 bill sponsored by Davis that banned transgender youths from competing in girls school sports.
Davis supported all those bills and said “key differences” in their voting records would be a campaign issue.
“We’re opposite a lot on some voting issues that are core Republican values,” she said. “I will always vote for morals and for what the Hoosier families believe in.”
The 62-year-old Walker said his wife’s 2023 death had him reevaluating what to do, but that he now had a new resolve.
“I’m not too sure this isn’t to my own hurt to do this,” he said. “It’s just that I think that needs to be done.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4151345-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Legislators, without an agreed upon proposal to consolidate school districts, are working to find a new starting point. Lawmakers are also mulling how to hold education costs steady.

MONTPELIER—Vermont lawmakers in the early days of the 2026 legislative session are trying to keep the education reforms started last session on track.
But the efforts appear on shaky ground after the state’s school redistricting task force refused to deliver a map of proposed consolidated school districts in November. Without a map of consolidated school districts, uncertainty has only grown in the six months since Gov. Phil Scott signed Act 73, the law setting the state on a course to radically transform how public schools are paid for and governed.
“I think that it is going to be very hard to get broad agreement on mandated consolidation,” said Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, the chair of the House Education Committee. “This is a pretty difficult situation.”

Scott devoted his State of the State address on Wednesday to rallying support for Act 73 and further education reforms, telling House and Senate members that the issue remains Vermont’s “most critical challenge.”
“Education transformation is not optional, it’s essential,” he said.
Legislative leaders, Conlon included, said they are intent on working toward reform. Other lawmakers say there is a path forward to create a new education finance formula, even if lawmakers cannot agree on consolidation.
Conlon’s counterpart in the Senate agrees. 
“We have a system now (where) really nobody’s responsible, and it’s resulting in people not being able to pay their property taxes,” said Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, the chair of the Senate Education Committee. “We must fix the system.”
And while legislators try to push forward with long-term changes, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, says he plans on introducing legislation Thursday to cap spending in Vermont’s school districts in the near term.
“If we’re going to get ourselves out of this situation where the General Fund is being eaten by the (Education) Fund, we have to have some hard stop on this kind of explosive growth,” Baruth said.
‘Everything’s on the table’
Lawmakers in the Senate and House education committees have spent their first two days brushing up on the intricacies of Act 73, as well as reviewing various reports from groups trying to map the future of public education.
“This is going to be a hard session for us,” Conlon told committee members Tuesday. “We are going to enter it with a philosophy of everything’s on the table.”
A joint meeting of the House and Senate education committees is scheduled for Thursday to discuss the redistricting task force’s final report.
Task force members called for lawmakers to instead create five cooperative education service regions, regional entities that would allow the 119 existing school districts to share resources for things such as special education and transportation.
Scott panned the task force’s proposal, and in his address Wednesday said their failure to produce a map proposal was “a political strategy to preserve the old system.”
Still, some lawmakers feel the task force’s proposal should be considered as lawmakers forge ahead in the coming weeks.
“They lay out a very different path forward, and it’s something that we’re going to need to take a very hard look at, given Vermonters’ very mixed reaction to the idea of mandated consolidation,” Conlon said in an interview.

‘This is a pretty difficult situation’
The heart of Act 73 is a planned shift to a foundation formula, a funding model used by most states in the country that would realign authority over school district budgets away from school districts and to the state.
Currently, school districts are allowed broad latitude in deciding how much to spend. With a foundation formula, the state would set a base funding amount per student and adjust for students requiring more support, shifting significant decision-making authority from local districts to the state. 
The new formula would help contain growing education costs, and consolidating districts is key to shifting to the new formula, Agency of Education officials have said previously.
But without a proposed map in front of them, lawmakers said consolidating school districts is a tall task.
“I think that it is going to be very hard to get broad agreement on mandated consolidation,” Conlon said. “This is a pretty difficult situation.”
During his speech, Scott said drawing new district lines “should be the first order of business for the committees of jurisdiction.”
Bongartz, meanwhile, said that while the task force “obviously set the process back,” lawmakers will have to find a new starting point.
“It’s just going to take letting the committee gel a little bit around this, taking a lot of testimony early, and trying to figure out the vehicle for getting to that repair or rewrite of the funding formula that we know has to happen,” Bongartz said.
In the meantime, lawmakers are at work figuring out how to keep rising property taxes under control.
Scott, in his initial budget proposal, said he plans on using $75 million in unused funds from this year’s state budget to dampen an expected 12% average property tax increase. That spike is driven in part by a projected $115 million increase in education spending next year.
“While it goes against the grain and doesn’t actually fix the problem we’re trying to solve, I’ll be asking you to provide some property tax relief with another band-aid,” Scott said during his State of the State address.
Buying down property taxes has become commonplace in recent years. Scott and lawmakers last year allocated more than $100 million to keep the average property tax bill nearly flat.
Even with the cash injections, average education property taxes have risen more than 40% across the state in the last five years, according to the Vermont Tax Department.
Baruth, the Senate’s leader, said he’s generally supportive of Scott’s plan to use money to buy down the education fund this year, but said it must be contingent on efforts to cap school districts’ spending.
To that end, Baruth said he plans on introducing legislation on Thursday that would set a cap on school districts budgets beginning in 2028 and 2029, based on a district’s previous year’s spending.
Scott has signalled some support for the idea. But other Democratic lawmakers have expressed skepticism over the plan.

Rob Roberson speaks during a press conference at the Capitol in Jackson on Thursday, March 7, 2024.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
After months of debate, public hearings and private negotiations, Mississippi House Speaker Jason White unveiled his massive bill to reshape public education and provide more school choice on Wednesday. 
The sprawling 553-page bill, titled the “Mississippi Education Freedom Act” or “House Bill 2,” includes a wide range of provisions. The legislation would direct some taxpayer funds to private schools, ease public school transfer regulations, make it easier to open charter schools statewide and expand the literacy act that helped lead Mississippi to nationally noted success in student literacy. 
READ MORE: Mississippi school-choice battle begins: House unveils omnibus plan. Senate wants teacher raise, opposes vouchers
The bill does not include a broad teacher pay raise, unlike a Senate bill passed earlier Wednesday. A teacher pay raise could emerge as a bargaining chip between the chambers. The House measure would raise assistant teacher minimum pay from $17,000 a year to $20,000.
The Senate is passing separate school bills rather than one large one like the House’s. The Senate’s approach focuses on loosening regulations around public school transfer and would not create a voucher system that allows parents to use taxpayer funds for private school tuition. 
In a social media post, White said the bill would build on recent gains in Mississippi’s education rankings and be a long-term investment in the state’s economy.
“HB 2 ensures that all Mississippi families, regardless of income or zip code, have real choices and the freedom to pursue what works best for their children, while prioritizing low- and middle-income families,” White said. “HB 2 also expands educational opportunities by removing barriers to high-quality public school options while fully preserving local school boards’ decision-making power to accept students who want to transfer from other districts.”
Here are some of the bill’s highlights:

Allows parents to use taxpayer funds to pay for private school tuition. This would be done by creating “Magnolia Student Accounts” (MSAs) for eligible students. Students would be eligible if they reside in Mississippi and are enrolled in the state’s K-12 education system. Schools that could participate include nonpublic schools that have been accredited and have educated students for at least four years. It would pay for these accounts by creating an “Education Freedom Fund” in the state Treasury, which would be funded by legislative appropriation. The MSAs would first be prioritized for students from families whose income is less than 100% of the area median income. Then it would extend to students whose household income is less than 200% of the area’s median income, followed by students from households with less than 300% of the area’s median income. After that, it would extend to all students regardless of income. In the program’s first year, the 2027-28 academic year, 12,500 scholarships would be available. By the program’s fourth year, that number would grow to 20,000. House leaders have not publicly provided a detailed estimate of the cost of the school choice and other proposals in the new bill, but House Education Chairman Rob Roberson said Wednesday that the vouchers would likely be about $7,000 each, the base cost the state now pays for public school students. Providing private school vouchers for 12,500 students, as the bill proposes, would cost $87.5 million.


Loosens regulations on public school transfers. The bill would remove the ability of school districts to stop a student from transferring to another public school district. Mississippi already has a limited version of this policy, commonly called “portability.” Under current law, the school board of a student’s home district must provide consent for the release of the student. House Bill 2 would change this, effectively shifting authority from the student’s home district to the receiving district. Transfers would be subject to the capacity of receiving districts to accept new students and are not to conflict with court desegregation orders. Student transfer requests must be approved by the receiving district’s school board in no more than 60 days. If transfers are denied because of lack of capacity, the bill requires districts to use lotteries and to maintain waitlists. The bill directs districts to publish capacity data, application timelines and the procedures used to choose transfer students in advance of the school year — a measure aimed at transparency, House leaders said. The Senate has passed its own portability plan to try to ease public school transfers.


Allow charter schools to open in any school district. The bill authorizes charter schools “within the geographical boundaries of any school district. Current state laws only allow charter schools to open without local school board approval in school districts with a D- or F-rating. Under the new bill, charter school applicants would no longer need a local school board’s endorsement in A-, B- or C-rated districts. The legislation would also alter the membership of the Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board. Membership would increase from seven to nine members, and one appointment would be reserved for Accelerate Mississippi, a pro-school choice organization. 


Expand the literacy act that helped lead to Mississippi’s national success in reading. In 2013, lawmakers focused financial and classroom support to teaching students in kindergarten through third grade how to read. The state established a third-grade reading test that students are required to pass to advance to the next grade. Experts say that legislation contributed hugely to the state’s subsequent reading gains that garnered national attention. The House’s package expands targeted literacy initiatives to grades 4 through 8. The reading gains have been dubbed the “Mississippi Miracle” by state leaders and education policy pundits. 
School district consolidation. The bill would consolidate the Copiah County and Hazlehurst City school districts, abolishing the former districts and creating a single new district effective July 1, 2028. But Roberson, the House Education Chairman, told Mississippi Today this approach could be used as a model for future district consolidations. The potential for school closures as a result of district consolidation has been a fear cited by many parents in rural areas. House Bill 2 says it would not require school closures even if the districts that govern these schools are abolished.

Both chambers of the Mississippi Legislature are dominated by Republicans, but some GOP members from areas such as Rankin County near Jackson and DeSoto County in northwest Mississippi have previously rejected school choice, largely citing opposition to educating students whose families don’t pay property taxes in the districts they would attend school. Democrats mostly oppose school choice, arguing the policies would siphon funds from the public school system and particularly away from schools in low-income areas.
The House education package included numerous other provisions that lawmakers and Capitol observers were reviewing on Wednesday. The House Education Committee, which met Wednesday, did not take up the omnibus education bill. Instead, the panel of representatives invited a group of parents who were almost all in favor of school choice to speak at a hearing.

Spencer Cox speaks during a news conference introducing a bell-to-bell cellphone ban in public schools on Jan. 7, 2026. (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Last fall Utah students had a taste of a statewide cellphone ban during classroom hours. But, the law that an overwhelming majority of the Legislature voted to pass last year doesn’t go far enough, Gov. Spencer Cox said. 
That effort, he said, won’t be finished until smart devices are prohibited during the whole school day, including lunch periods, transition times between classes, and recess. So, when the Utah Legislature convenes on Jan. 20, South Jordan Republican Sen. Lincoln Fillmore will be taking another look at the cellphone ban bill he passed last year and incorporating Cox’s feedback.
“We have an opportunity to fix what we got wrong last time and do it the right way this time. I am convinced more than ever that a bell-to-bell cellphone ban is the single most important thing that we can do for our students in our schools today,” Cox said during a news conference promoting Fillmore’s new bill on Wednesday.

Under the current law, public schools in Utah have a default cellphone ban policy for students during class time. However, administrators have the power to implement rules that can be either more flexible or stricter for devices. That’s something that Fillmore’s 2026 bill won’t change. 
“I am not aware of a single school district, even though they have the power to do so, who have gone less than what the state law requires them to do,” Fillmore said. “But I am aware of a lot of individual schools and school districts who have stepped farther.”
Some schools already have a bell-to-bell cellphone ban, including Granger High in West Valley City, which established the rule in 2024. According to Cox, a principal in one of those schools reported higher attendance rates, better test scores and fewer bullying incidents.
Cox applauds bills taking aim at ‘destructive’ apps and cellphones

It is up to schools to provide storage solutions for phones, Fillmore said. Some have invested in magnetic locking pouches, while others have required students to simply keep their devices in their backpacks. 
“There are all kinds of workable solutions here at various costs, and I think it’s appropriate to let those decisions be made at the local school district,” he said.
For Cox, who has campaigned to reduce social media usage and increase regulations on tech companies, this is “an easy call,” he said. Especially with the rise of artificial intelligence.  
“If we thought it wasn’t a fair fight with the social media companies, the fight is going to completely overwhelm us with AI chatbots and their ability to not just rewire our brains, but hijack everything that makes us human,” he said. “And we can’t allow that to happen in our schools.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Describing devices and social media as addictive, Cox added that it is a mistake to not understand “the destructive power of these devices.” School cellphone policies, he added, are tied to the conservative principle to collectively protect children “against these harms that are debasing them.” 
Avery Gonzales, who advocated for the 2025 law during her senior year in Cache County, was also at the news conference with representatives from The Policy Project, a nonprofit in the state that has backed the cellphone ban effort. 
While Gonzales remembers her peers being upset at her for standing by the rule, she said many had a change of heart when they realized the effects their phones had on their connections with classmates.
“Instead of scrolling alone, they are talking, laughing and finally building real friendships,” she said. “A bell-to-bell approach would strengthen the positive results we are already seeing today. This approach creates consistency and clarity. It allows students to fully disconnect from their screens and fully reconnect with learning and with each other.”

This story was originally reported by Orion Rummler of The 19th.  Meet Orion and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Three children’s hospitals are under federal investigation for providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth, as the Trump administration continues to use all the levers it can to block such care.
Health and Human Services (HHS) General Counsel Mike Stuart has referred three children’s hospitals to the agency’s inspector general’s office: Seattle Children’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and Children’s Minnesota. Gender-affirming care for trans youth is legal in all three states. But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month announced that medical practitioners who provide gender-affirming care to minors are out of compliance with federal health care standards. Now, the agency is enforcing that declaration.
In response, Children’s Hospital Colorado has reportedly paused gender-affirming care for trans youth. Children’s Minnesota did not respond to a request for comment, and its website states that “at this time, our gender health services remain unchanged.” Seattle Children’s hospital also did not respond.
Another hospital, Denver Health, has also paused gender-affirming care for trans youth since Kennedy’s declaration, although the hospital does not appear to be under investigation.
In earlier efforts by Trump administration officials to investigate and halt  gender-affirming care, both Children’s Hospital Colorado and Seattle Children’s Hospital successfully fought back against Justice Department subpoenas seeking trans patients’ medical information.
The administration previously pressured hospitals to halt gender-affirming care by threatening to revoke federal funding, which worked in many cases, but these HHS investigations mark a new escalation. They stem from Kennedy saying that, under his authority as health secretary, he can unilaterally decide that gender-affirming care — which  he calls “sex-rejecting procedures” — is not a safe and effective treatment for trans youth.
The response from states has been swift. Just before Christmas, 19 states — including Washington state, Colorado, and Minnesota — and Washington, D.C., sued Kennedy and the federal health agency over the announcement. The states’ lawsuit says the declaration harms their ability to administer state Medicaid plans in accordance with local laws protecting gender-affirming care.
“To me, the declaration is the extremely clear way they are trying to just shut down this care all across the country,” said Katie Keith, director of the center for health policy and the law at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown Law. “They are trying to ban it nationwide for minors.”
On X, Stuart said that all three hospitals were referred to the agency’s inspector general’s office for failing to meet “recognized standards of health care,” citing Kennedy’s declaration.
The HHS has also proposed two new rules to restrict gender-affirming care for trans youth — both of which must still go through an approval process before they can be enforced. One rule would block hospitals from receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds if they provide gender-affirming care to trans youth. That care includes hormone replacement therapy for adolescents and puberty blockers for young kids who are experiencing dysphoria — intense discomfort or anxiety felt when someone’s physical gender is out of sync with their identity. It also includes surgery, which is very rarely performed on minors.
Another proposed rule would bar Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for youth under 18 and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) from covering such care for youth under 19. This would disproportionately impact low-income trans youth. Technically, states could still use their own funds for coverage — but experts say that would be extremely burdensome and ultimately cause gaps in care.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization of 67,000 primary care pediatricians and other specialists, strongly condemned these proposals, saying that they misrepresent current medical consensus and create uncertainty for patients.
“These rules are a baseless intrusion into the patient-physician relationship,” the group said in a statement. “Patients, their families, and their physicians — not politicians or government officials — should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them.”The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will challenge these two restrictions in court if they are finalized.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/164A4473-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Andy Beshear announces plans for a housing development for flood victims, The Cottages at Thompson Branch in Marlowe. (Photo provided by governor's office)FRANKFORT — Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is asking the GOP-controlled state legislature for $500 million in one-time spending to ease families’ “rising cost pressures,” fund his educational priority of “Pre-K for All” and pay for hundreds of millions in increased Medicaid costs. 
That’s according to a 12-page summary shared with reporters during a Wednesday morning budget briefing ahead of the governor’s State of the Commonwealth address later in the day. Beshear administration staff gave reporters the summary under embargo until the start of the 5:30 p.m. speech. 
Reporters did not receive the Beshear administration’s full budget proposal, usually constituting hundreds of pages detailing revenue and spending by individual government cabinets, agencies and programs.
The summary, however, does provide highlights of the governor’s policy priorities for the next two-year state budget, along with economic challenges the popular incumbent sees facing the state. High among those challenges is Congress’ passage of Republican President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, shifting costs for federal social safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states. 
Beshear’s earlier budget proposals have held little sway with the GOP-controlled General Assembly. Republican leaders often pass their own budget, disregarding much of what Beshear proposes, though occasional bipartisanship is found on specific issues. The legislature has easily overridden Beshear’s line-item vetoes of budget bills during past sessions. What’s adopted this year will be the last state budget before the two-term governor leaves office next year.
“With the modest revenue picture and hundreds of millions of dollars in expected pension obligations, increasing costs of health care, the need to invest in education, maintain public safety, and grow new jobs, the 2026-28 budget will be challenging,” the executive summary states. “Moreover Kentucky has to contend with federal actions that have pushed costs onto all states and have made it harder on families to afford health care or remain eligible for Medicaid. 
What is Beshear calling for? 
Some of Beshear’s proposals to address “affordability issues” echo past calls for action from advocates. 
Among the $500 million in Beshear’s proposed one-time spending:

$150 million for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, a pool of money that the Kentucky Housing Corporation manages to subsidize housing projects. Affordable housing advocates across the state have made repeated calls for the Kentucky legislature to significantly bolster the fund.  
A $125 million fund for hospitals to bridge “financial risks” from federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions that limit states’ use of provider taxes to support hospitals.
A $100 million fund to help cover the increase of health insurance costs from expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans, called kynect in Kentucky.. 
Create a “Utility Assistance Fund” with $75 million to be distributed by community action agencies, to provide assistance for Kentuckians facing rising utility bills. Some advocates have called for a utility disconnection moratorium this winter.
$50 million to go to Feeding Kentucky, a network of seven food banks, to help with “rising food costs putting pressure on family budgets.” 

Beshear also calls for fully funding the state’s Medicaid program, requiring an additional $420 million from the General Fund for fiscal year 2028. The summary states the One Big Beautiful Act will remove an estimated 28,539 people from Medicaid due to tighter eligibility requirements added through the law. 
The budget proposal also calls for $101.5 million over two fiscal years to cover increased administrative costs shifted to states for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Education funding continues to be a major component of Beshear’s budget proposal, calling for launching “Pre-K for All,” or universal preschool for 4-year-olds in Kentucky. His proposal would allocate $40.8 million, coming from the state’s sports wagering excise tax, for fiscal year 2028 to “support the initial phase of Pre-K for All.” 
Beshear’s is proposing an additional $158.8 million for schools — outside the Support Education Excellence in Kentucky, or SEEK, funding program — to give a 3% salary raise to full-time school personnel in fiscal year 2027. His proposal would allow teachers to retain a portion of their paycheck now going into a medical insurance trust fund. 
Along with fully funding teachers’ pensions and medical benefits for retirees, Beshear proposes a 2.5% increase in SEEK funding for school districts in each fiscal year of the biennium.

Clerk ‘has committed several acts of misconduct or malfeasance,’ according to Gov. Mark Gordon. She doesn’t plan to resign.
The post Governor seeks Weston County clerk’s removal for 2024 election conduct, ignoring subpoena appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon has directed the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to seek the removal of Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock, he announced Wednesday. 
“The Governor believes the Weston County Clerk has committed several acts of misconduct or malfeasance including her failure to appear for a legislative subpoena and her filing of a false audit report in conjunction with her duties as the Clerk of Weston County,” his office said in a statement. 
The issue dates back to the 2024 general election when Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results after using the wrong ballots, resulting in a dramatic undercount in the vote for Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, who was running unopposed. Ultimately, a hand count sorted out the results, but the problem remained unresolved for many local voters who took issue with an initial post-election audit.
Additional issues arose: One pertained to allegations that Hadlock filed a false post-election audit. The second accused her of defying a legislative subpoena.
In October, Gordon received a verified complaint from four qualified electors of Weston County. That set off a process, as outlined in state law, that tasks the governor with determining whether to recommend the attorney general seek the removal of an elected official in district court. 
How we got here
This is the second time Gordon has been tasked with investigating Hadlock over her actions in the 2024 election. 
In the first investigation, Gordon decided that Hadlock “made many serious mistakes,” but “her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation.” 
Since then, Hadlock failed to appear before a legislative body despite a subpoena to do so. The second complaint pointed to that decision, in addition to the post-election audit. 
After Hadlock was charged with a misdemeanor for defying the subpoena, her attorney asked the court to dismiss the case last month, contending that the subpoena is void because a legislative investigation was illegal to begin with. 
Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s attorney, said in a Wednesday statement to WyoFile that his client “remains the elected county clerk for the people of Weston County.”
“She does not intend to resign. She looks forward to reviewing the Governor’s decision and findings as well as any legal filings to come regarding the Governor’s decision,” Semerad wrote. “In the meantime, she will continue to serve the people of Weston County to the very best of her ability.” 
Gordon’s decision
Hadlock’s first act of misconduct or malfeasance, according to Gordon’s findings letter, was “her failure to appear in response to the legislative subpoena.”
Rep. Chris Knapp of Gillette, co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Management Audit Committee, sent a subpoena to Hadlock ahead of a September meeting of a subcommittee investigating her actions. But the clerk informed lawmakers via letter that she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict, and that others would appear on her behalf. 
“More pivotal in my determination here is her failure to confirm the adequacy of the arrangements and to take on faith, having heard nothing to the contrary, that those arrangements were satisfactory,” Gordon wrote. “It seems to me that any responsible public servant would make an effort to obtain some documentation or affirmation that their arrangements had been properly accepted before proceeding to miss such an obviously important summons from the legislature.”
Secondly, Gordon raised the issue of the post-election ballot, in which Hadlock “failed to discover twenty-one incorrect ballot entries,” he wrote, adding that that “could likely be construed as misconduct or malfeasance.”
The governor also wrote that based on the information he was provided, “there is no explanation from Clerk Hadlock or any other person as to how the audit could have indicated no problems when at least twenty-one ballots were not accounted for properly.”
As he found in his first investigation, Gordon wrote that he did “not believe that Clerk Hadlock displayed any malicious intent to the outcome of the election. However, her failure to properly perform the post-election audit adds to the governor’s previous findings of incompetence,” he wrote. 
“Taken together they contribute to the appearance of misconduct or malfeasance,” Gordon wrote. “These careless actions demonstrate at best an inattentiveness to detail and at worst a disregard for her responsibilities as County Clerk. Thus, it appears that Clerk’s Hadlock continued dereliction of duty on these pertinent matters aggregately amounts to misconduct or malfeasance.”
As such, Gordon directed Attorney General Keith Kautz to commence prosecution. 
In separate statements, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Secretary of State Chuck Gray lauded the decision to seek Hadlock’s removal. Both have been critical of how the governor has handled the matter in the past.

The move will impact the paper’s print and digital content.
The paper’s parent company, Block Communication Inc., said in a press release that the decision to shutter the outlet was spurred by recent legal rulings  against the Post-Gazette  and in favor of the union representing its newsroom employees.
“The ownership of the Post-Gazette has been talking about how this day might come eventually, but it’s still shocking when the announcement actually goes out,” said Andrew Conte, the managing director of the center for media innovation at Point Park University. “It’s a blow to the media ecosystem, but also a blow to communities across southwestern Pennsylvania. We’ll have one fewer news organization telling the stories here, and the Post-Gazette was one of the major sources of information here.”

Conte said the Post-Gazette, founded in the 18th century as the Pittsburgh Gazette, is the oldest newspaper west of the Allegheny mountains.
“Going back to the pioneer days, this organization was the one telling stories of the lives of people who live here in southwestern Pennsylvania,” he said.
The paper had recently lost a legal battle with the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, which represented Post-Gazette workers who’d been on strike between October 2022 and November 2025.
“Recent court decisions would require the Post-Gazette to operate under a 2014 labor contract that imposes on the Post-Gazette outdated and inflexible operational practices unsuited for today’s local journalism,” a press release said. “We deeply regret the impact this decision will have on Pittsburgh and the surrounding region.”
The press release said that Block Communications lost more than $350 million operating the paper over the last 20 years.
The announcement came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from the paper to stay a lower court decision forcing them to reinstate the terms of a previous union contract.
“Rather than follow federal law, the Blocks, the owners of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, would rather destroy a very long-standing publication that serves the people of Pittsburgh,” said Jon Schleuss, president of the national NewsGuild-CWA. “They spent millions of dollars fighting journalists and refusing to follow federal labor law.”
Schleuss said the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh represents around 100 employees at the Post-Gazette.
Allan Block, who co-owns the paper with his brother John Robinson Block, hung up his phone after being reached by the Capital-Star.
Steve Mellon, a veteran reporter who’s spent more than 25 years at the Post-Gazette, said employees were called into an emergency meeting shortly after the Supreme Court announcement. Then, they learned in a pre-recorded video about Block Communications’ decision to close the paper.
“I thought, ‘You gotta be kidding me,’” Mellon said.”Especially thinking about my younger colleagues who are on their first or second jobs.”
The video, a recording of which was viewed by the Capital-Star, was roughly two-and-a-half minutes long. Employees were asked to work “under business as usual conditions” and “consider the legacy of the Post-Gazette” through the paper’s final day.
Union journalists at the Post-Gazette began an unfair labor practice strike in October, 2022 after working for years without a union contract.
The union alleged that the Blocks refused to negotiate in good faith and unilaterally changed reporters to a lower quality healthcare plan. 
They received several favorable decisions from the National Labor Review Board, an administrative law judge and the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals before returning to work in November, 2025 under the terms of their last collectively bargained contract. Before it ended, it was the longest ongoing strike in the country.
The paper, however, continued to publish during the strike. A number of journalists chose to remain on the job, and more employees were hired over the course of the three-year work stoppage.
Striking workers began an online publication of their own, the Pittsburgh Union Progress, which ceased operations when union journalists returned to the Post-Gazette.
“Post-Gazette journalists have done award-winning work for decades, and we’re going to pursue all options to make sure that Pittsburgh continues to have the caliber of journalism it deserves,” Andrew Goldstein, a Post-Gazette employee and president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh-CWA, said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon.
Schleuss said the Newsguild is willing to “pursue all options for the sake of the journalists and the Pittsburgh community.” That may include seeking potential buyers for the Post-Gazette or people interested in funding a new outlet.
“The Block Family should be ashamed of themselves,” said state Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny), who supported striking workers by refusing interviews with the Post-Gazette during the three-year work stoppage. “They could have saved a ton of money if they just negotiated in good faith with the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh from the beginning. It is absurd that they repeatedly blame workers for their failure to manage their own business.
“My heart goes out to the Post-Gazette workers who have been through so much and have never deserved how they were treated. They are the only ones leaving that building with their dignity intact.”
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette received Pulitzer Prizes, one of the highest honors in journalism, in 1938, 1998 and 2019. The most recent one was for  coverage of the deadly mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood.
Mellon, the veteran journalist, is still hopeful about the future for the Post-Gazettes employees and the Pittsburgh news ecosystem.
“Don’t count out the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh,” he said. “We’ve been up against gigantic odds in the past and we’ve come through. We know how to organize.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PG-office-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Free.,Rubio to meet with Danish officials amid Greenland push by Trump administration,"Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rubio-meet-danish-officials-amid-greenland-push-trump-administration,,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday he will meet with Danish officials next week, following a recent push from the Trump administration to annex or even use the military against Greenland — a course of action questioned by several Republican senators.Senators sat through a closed, classified briefing Wednesday with Rubio about ongoing U.S. intervention in Venezuela launched over the weekend, and Democrats said afterward that he did not address their concerns about the operation. In addition, President Donald Trump is considering options to acquire Greenland, including possible military operations, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.Danish officials have repeatedly stressed any move to take the sovereign nation by force would violate NATO bylaws, which bar members from acts of aggression against each other. Greenland, with a population of about 56,000, has its own local government but is also part of the Realm of Denmark.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters she does not support Trump’s goals for Greenland. “I hate the rhetoric around either acquiring Greenland by purchase or by force. And you know I don't use the word hate very often. But I think that it is very, very unsettling,” Murkowski said. “And certainly concerning as one who has actually been to Greenland.”Rubio told reporters following the Venezuela briefing — open to all senators — that Energy Secretary Chris Wright will outline the Trump administration’s plans for that nation’s oil reserves later Wednesday. Trump said Saturday that the United States will “run the country” of Venezuela until “a proper transition can take place.”“We feel very positive that not only will that generate revenue that will be used for the benefit of the Venezuelan people ... but it also gives us an amount of leverage and influence and control over how this process plays out,” Rubio said. The Senate meeting with Rubio, which also included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, followed days of escalation by the Trump administration abroad that included capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and bringing him to the United States to face criminal charges, threatening to take Greenland by force from NATO member Denmark and seizing a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic sea as well as a second tanker tied to Venezuela.

Hegseth after the briefing defended the U.S. capture of the vessels, arguing the Trump administration was enforcing sanctions placed on Venezuelan oil. The episode with the oil tankers was disclosed early Wednesday when the U.S. military issued a social media statement that the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security apprehended a “stateless” ship in the Caribbean Sea and another in the North Atlantic. Leavitt said during an afternoon press briefing that Trump officials will meet with oil executives on Friday to discuss an ""immersive opportunity.”Hours after the Jan. 3 military operation to capture Maduro, Trump stressed that Venezuela’s oil reserves were a major factor in U.S. plans. Trump told reporters that major oil companies were notified before and after the operation in Venezuela. Senate GOP skepticalBesides Murkowski, a handful of other Senate Republicans also expressed concern about the White House statement leaving open the possibility of military action on Greenland.Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said “we need to not threaten a peaceful nation that's an ally where we have a military base already.” Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she also disagreed with the Trump administration’s push to acquire Greenland and said she’s not sure if the Trump administration is serious about using military force.“It surprises me every time it comes up,” she said.GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said he doesn't “think military intervention is on the table” for Greenland. Louisiana’s Republican Sen. John Kennedy said “to invade Greenland would be weapons grade stupid, and I don't think President Trump is weapons grade stupid, nor is Marco Rubio.” He instead suggested possibly purchasing the territory, an offer that Denmark has already rejected.Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, wrote in a critical statement that ""cooperation with Arctic allies from Canada to the Nordics already grants the United States sweeping access to positions of strategic importance.""  “Threats and intimidation by U.S. officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,"" McConnell wrote. ""And the use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America’s most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters following his weekly press conference he couldn’t comment on hypotheticals about a military takeover of Greenland, including whether Congress must approve such an action. “No, I can’t because it depends on what that is. The Congress has a responsibility to declare war and I think there is no scenario where we’d be at war with Greenland,” Johnson said. “Under Article II, as we talked about in the room, the president has broad authority as commander-in-chief, as all previous presidents have. No one can forecast what is going to happen in Greenland. You’re asking a hypothetical that I cannot answer.”Johnson said during the press conference that he doesn’t believe anyone in the Trump administration is “seriously considering” military action in Greenland. “And in the Congress, we're certainly not.”Democrats move toward vote on war powersDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut called the administration’s plan regarding Venezuelan oil “insane.” “They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” he said. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.” Though Murphy said he was glad administration officials held a briefing, he also said he envisioned a “very, very rough ride” ahead. Senate Democrats are gearing up to take another vote on a war powers resolution intended to curb Trump’s military actions abroad. An earlier attempt to pass a resolution was prompted by the administration’s multiple boat strikes in the Caribbean, which officials claimed were carrying drugs to the U.S., but backers failed to reach the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.The next vote, led by Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, is expected to take place this week.Walking out of the briefing, Kaine said “it’s time to get this out of the (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and get it in public hearings where senators can ask questions and the American public can learn what the hell is going on.” Such facilities are secure settings where classified information can be shared.Kaine said he could not get a clear answer from the briefing if the Trump administration’s actions in Venezuela will be replicated for other countries like Greenland or Cuba.Sen. Jacky Rosen questioned what the administration’s actions mean for the U.S., despite consensus Maduro is a “very brutal dictator” and satisfaction among many that he’s no longer governing Venezuela. While Maduro is no longer in charge, his vice president was sworn in, Delcy Rodríguez, effectively continuing the regime. “We have problems right here at home,” the Nevada Democrat said, pointing to the recent expiration of enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. “Last time anybody checked, December 31st was just about a week ago, and how many people lost their health insurance because they couldn't afford it because Donald Trump's so busy, and Pete Hegseth’s so busy with the visuals of all these bombs going off all around the world that they're not paying attention to people who are going to lose their health care?” asked Rosen.Murphy, Kaine and Rosen all sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the past six years, anyone who places bets online in Rhode Island had just a single app available — one with some harsh reviews from users and lawmakers. But that could change later this year, the target date for the Rhode Island Lottery to select a second online sports betting vendor to join the state’s small digital sportsbook.
The Rhode Island Lottery intends to award a five-year contract to a company willing to “provide competitive sports wagering products and services” in the state’s market in November 2026,  according to a 55-page request for qualifications issued Dec. 2.
Potential bidders will have through noon on Feb. 19 to respond to the Lottery’s latest step in expanding Rhode Island’s small sportsbook market beyond the Sportsbook RI app run by International Game Technology (IGT).
“The intention is to seek one new app vendor (in addition to SportsbookRI) to begin offering online sports betting after November 2026,” Lottery spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said in an email to Rhode Island Current. “There would be an evaluation period, of unspecified length at the moment, to decide how well the new app is working, being accepted by bettors, and whether it’s adding to the state’s online sports betting revenue.”
Adding one more vendor still falls short of a recommendation in a Lottery-commissioned report published May 1 by Spectrum Gaming Group. The report called for the state to add four to six new online sports betting vendors to stay competitive with neighboring states. Massachusetts has seven vendors, while Connecticut allows three.
IGT, formerly headquartered in Providence before its 2024 acquisition by Las Vegas-based Apollo Global Management Inc., has managed the Sportsbook RI app since September 2019. The app has had mixed reviews from users even as it boasts a 4.4 star rating on Apple’s App Store and a 4.4 on Google Play. 
“Every time I win a PGA wager I have to call on Monday to try to collect my money,” one Google Play user wrote in August 2025. “It usually takes two days of calling for them to grade the wager.”
“They are lucky we only have one sportbook in RI or they would go out of business,” the same user added.
Another user wrote they would give the app zero stars if they could.
“I hate this app, customer service apologizes and says that they are expediting my case, but I never get a response from a supervisor, I don’t even think they have supervisors, because I’ve never spoken to one!” they wrote.
IGT will remain a part of the state’s market. The request for qualifications states IGT is contracted to provide equipment, technology, services and/or products related to both retail and online sports wagering through Nov. 25, 2028. The state’s most recent contract with the company signed in 2023, however, set a November 2026 expiration date but allowed three extensions: a three-year “first extension,” which was granted in 2023, followed by a two-year term, and a five-year.
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who led the state’s push for additional sports betting vendors last year, said he was not aware of IGT’s extension.
“I was aware that it ends in 2026,” he told Rhode Island Current.
IGT confirmed the contract extension in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon following inquiry from Rhode Island Current.
“IGT is very pleased to continue our long-term relationship with the Rhode Island Lottery through 2028 and help generate important revenue for the State through its sports betting operations powered by PlaySports technology,” said Joe Bertolone, senior vice president of IGT Sports Betting, said in a statement. “IGT PlaySports continues to invest in the Sportsbook Rhode Island app to ensure the Lottery is offering a premier betting product that makes a positive impact on the State’s commitments to good causes.”
Lawmakers have tried to make sports betting more appealing in Rhode Island in recent years as a way to recapture bets that have since gone to neighboring states, including failed bills filed last year to expand the number of sports betting vendors to between three and five by July 2026.
An October 2025 report by the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General found revenue generated by sports wagers declined by 3.2% in the most recent fiscal year that ended June 30, 2025 — with only $18.6 million transferred to the state’s general fund. In fiscal year 2024, the state received $19.2 million from sports betting.
Connecticut, which legalized sports betting in 2021, saw over $26 million in revenue from online bets in the most recent fiscal year, according to data from the state’s Department of Consumer Protection.
Massachusetts, which launched sports betting in 2023, saw over $157 million in online gaming revenue collected by the state in the most recent fiscal year, according to data from the commonwealth’s Gaming Commission.
Gaming companies had through Jan. 2 to email questions about the state’s solicitation to regulators by Jan. 2. Answers are expected to be emailed by Jan. 23 and posted on the state’s online bid portal afterward, according to the request for qualifications.
But just how much interest other companies have is being kept under wraps.
“RILOT has nothing to share at this time regarding submissions to the RFQ,” Grimaldi said.
R.I.’s sportsbook market may open up to competition next year. Here’s who’s waiting in the wings.

Eight firms responded to a preliminary call for interest issued over the summer, including IGT and Providence-based Bally’s Corp. Other respondents to that request included Fanatics, Kambi, DraftKings, BetMGM, OpenBet, and FanDuel. 
Rhode Island Current reached out to each company for comment on whether they plan to respond to the Lottery’s request for qualifications.
Patti Doyle, a spokesperson for Bally’s, said the company intends to submit a proposal to the state by its Feb. 19 deadline. As of 2026, the Providence-headquartered company runs online sports betting in 11 states, including Massachusetts.
Kambi spokesperson Peter Ranere told Rhode Island Current the Malta-based company “remains engaged in the process and continues to evaluate opportunities related to Rhode Island’s online sports betting market.”
The Rhode Island Lottery’s request asks that a potential vendor be able to get online wagering up and running by Nov. 30. No timeline has been set for a formal request for proposals.

Si bien pocas víctimas de los incendios del año pasado han regresado a sus hogares, eso no es inusual después de un desastre natural; cambios en el otorgamiento de permisos parecen estar ayudando. 


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En los días posteriores al incendio de Los Ángeles en enero pasado, legisladores estatales y líderes cívicos prometieron impulsar la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas. Para California, donde la tramitación de permisos y la construcción de viviendas son notoriamente lentas y costosas, la magnitud de la destrucción representó un desafío singular.
Un año después, las casas carbonizadas, los electrodomésticos derretidos y la ceniza tóxica han sido prácticamente retirados, la tierra subyacente raspada y luego retirada. Muchos de los residentes cuyas casas se salvaron han regresado. Se han solicitado permisos para la reconstrucción y se han contratado arquitectos y contratistas. Continúan las disputas con las compañías de seguros , los servicios públicos y los bancos; abundan los terrenos baldíos y los árboles ennegrecidos, pero si miras alrededor, aquí y allá encontrarás nuevas construcciones.
Hasta esta semana, se han emitido más de 2600 permisos residenciales entre Palisades y Altadena, aproximadamente uno por cada cinco de las casi 13,000 viviendas perdidas. Otros 3340 están en revisión.
Para muchos propietarios desplazados y traumatizados, esto representa un retorno insoportablemente lento a lo que era su vida antes del incendio. Pero, según los estándares históricos, la recuperación de Los Ángeles ha sido bastante rápida hasta ahora.
 En un comunicado de prensa conmemorativo del primer aniversario del desastre, el gobernador Gavin Newsom elogió las cifras de permisos como “históricas”.
 El año pasado, los gobiernos locales (la ciudad y el condado de Los Ángeles, así como Malibú y Pasadena) emitieron permisos para viviendas unifamiliares y unidades de vivienda auxiliares “tres veces más rápido” que en los cinco años previos al incendio, señaló la administración.
 Reconstruir después de un desastre es casi siempre un proceso lento y agotador. De las más de 22,500 viviendas destruidas en cinco de los incendios más destructivos de California entre 2017 y 2020, menos de cuatro de cada diez se habían reconstruido para 2025, según un análisis de Los Angeles Times de finales del verano pasado.
 Un año después de que grandes incendios arrasaron Maui, Paradise, Redding y las afueras de Boulder, Colorado, se había permitido la reconstrucción del 2%, 3%, 15% y 30% de las viviendas destruidas, respectivamente, según un análisis separado del Urban Institute.
 Según el ritmo de tramitación de permisos, la reconstrucción de Los Ángeles avanza con relativa rapidez. Pero los permisos recién obtenidos no son viviendas terminadas.
 “La gente puede obtener permisos, pero si no tienen los costos resueltos, hemos tenido gente que ha abandonado sus planes”, dijo Devang Shah, de Genesis Builders, empresa que vende reconstrucciones preaprobadas a precio fijo en Altadena. Usar los permisos como indicador de progreso podría ser prematuro, añadió.
 Parte del rápido progreso que ha experimentado Los Ángeles puede deberse a cambios regulatorios impuestos por decreto tras el incendio. A principios de 2025, tanto Newsom como la alcaldesa Karen Bass ordenaron una tramitación más rápida de permisos para reconstrucciones similares, es decir, construcciones que se ajustaran a las dimensiones aproximadas y las especificaciones de diseño de la vivienda anterior. El condado de Los Ángeles implementó un programa piloto de autocertificación de aprobación de planos de construcción para ciertos proyectos sencillos. Newsom eximió los requisitos del código de construcción para reducir el costo de la reconstrucción.
 “Obtuvimos la aprobación de planificación en tres días, algo que normalmente habría llevado tres meses”, dijo Tim Vordtriede, arquitecto que también perdió su casa en Altadena. El condado ha “realizado un trabajo extraordinario al optimizar al máximo la burocracia”.
 En las semanas posteriores al incendio, Vordtriede cofundó Altadena Collective, una red de diseñadores y arquitectos que ofrece servicios de diseño con descuento, asesoramiento sobre permisos y recomendaciones de contratistas a los sobrevivientes locales. Él y sus cofundadores Chris Driscoll y Chris Corbett también han creado una organización sin fines de lucro llamada Collective OR, cuyo objetivo es representar a propietarios inexpertos y ansiosos en las negociaciones con constructores y arquitectos.
 Es imposible decir: ‘Ya estaban aquí para esta fecha, así que nosotros también deberíamos estar allí’. El conjunto de datos es demasiado variable.Colette Curtis, directora de recuperación y desarrollo económico, Paradise
 El ritmo de la reconstrucción puede simplemente beneficiarse del hecho de que se lleva a cabo en el condado de Los Ángeles: un gigantesco centro económico repleto de recursos financieros y conexiones políticas.
 “Tenemos acceso a una cadena de suministro realmente buena, hay mucho capital, hay mucha infraestructura”, dijo Ben Stapleton, director del US Green Building Council California.
 Esto contrasta con una ciudad como Paradise.
Desde que la mayoría de las viviendas de la localidad fueron destruidas en un incendio en 2018, se han reconstruido menos de 1 de cada 5, dijo Colette Curtis, directora de recuperación y desarrollo económico de la ciudad del condado de Butte.
Curtis advirtió que no se debe comparar el ritmo de los esfuerzos de reconstrucción entre las comunidades afectadas por el desastre.
 “Es imposible decir: ‘Ya estaban aquí para esta fecha, así que nosotros también deberíamos estar allí'”, dijo. “El conjunto de datos es demasiado variable”.
Paradise, un pueblo remoto con ingresos relativamente bajos, carecía de los servicios locales y del atractivo filantrópico de lugares como Lahaina y Palisades, dijo. Pero la baja en el valor de los terrenos y el hecho de que los propietarios desplazados no hayan tenido que competir con los inversores que reservan nuevas unidades para alquileres turísticos fue un factor positivo.
 Otra cosa que puede darle una ventaja a Los Ángeles es que es una región que también tiene un gran nivel de experiencia.
 Casi al mismo tiempo que Vordtriede estaba creando el Altadena Collective, la pareja de arquitectos vecinos Cynthia Sigler y Alex Athenson lanzaron el Catálogo Foothill, un paquete de planos arquitectónicos y estructurales listos para usar que han sido aprobados previamente por el condado de Los Ángeles.
 Con aproximadamente 15 proyectos en construcción o preparándose para comenzar, Athenson dijo que el proceso de preaprobación puede reducir al menos un 10% el costo total de desarrollo de una casa unifamiliar personalizada.
 Esto se debe en parte a la simplificación del proceso de aprobación. Pero también a que, antes del incendio, una vivienda unifamiliar a medida en Altadena era un producto de lujo.
La industria local está “preparada para atender a ese cliente que construye la casa de sus sueños desde cero, con un presupuesto muy amplio, si no ilimitado”, dijo Athenson. Los propietarios de larga data desplazados por incendios, muchos de ellos con ingresos fijos, representan un tipo de cliente muy diferente.
 Mientras los constructores, diseñadores y formuladores de políticas se esfuerzan por reconstruir de formas más rápidas, más económicas y más resistentes al fuego, pueden tropezar con una solución que podría ser útil mucho después de que se reconstruya la última casa en Altadena, agregó.
 “En definitiva, estamos ofreciendo un sistema para un desarrollo de vivienda más eficiente y asequible”, dijo Athenson. “Me entusiasma probarlo en Altadena y ver qué sucederá más allá”.
 Hasta la fecha, el condado ha aprobado más de dos docenas de planos del catálogo. Athenson afirmó que están negociando con la ciudad de Los Ángeles la implementación de un lote similar para Palisades.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/083025-Palisades-Fire-Rebuild-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 17:12:47.229597

Dozens of people in South Carolina’s Upstate region have been diagnosed with measles this fall. (Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s measles outbreak is among the worst in the country as the number of cases in the Upstate continues to rise with no end in sight, health officials said Wednesday.
As of Tuesday, 211 people in the state were diagnosed with the highly contagious virus, according to the state health department. That’s more than any state but Texas, which reported more than 800 cases in 2025, according to the Texas health agency.
Four of the cases in South Carolina required hospital stays, said state epidemiologist Linda Bell. She did not disclose any more information on those people or their conditions, citing patient privacy concerns.
SC measles cases grow to 144, with more expected following holiday travel

South Carolina’s outbreak has begun to spread in neighboring states as well, with four North Carolina children who visited Spartanburg County testing positive for the disease, according to the neighboring health department.
“It is clear the virus is circulating in the community,” Bell told reporters Wednesday. “The question is who in the community, who is susceptible, will get infected.”
The only surefire way to stop the virus from spreading is vaccination, Bell said. Of the people infected during the ongoing outbreak, at least 93% were unvaccinated, according to the health department.
“The more people we get vaccinated, the faster we can slow the spread of the virus,” Bell said.
As of Wednesday, 144 people were in quarantine for exposure to the virus without previous immunity, such as vaccination or a previous infection.
That included nine students from two Spartanburg schools: Sugar Ridge Elementary and Boiling Springs Elementary.
Other cases came from exposures at Tabernacle of Salvation Church, Slavic Pentecostal Church of Spartanburg and Ark of Salvation Church. All three churches in Inman conduct services in the Russian language. Exposures also occurred at Unitarian Universalist Church in Spartanburg, according to the health department.
The health department has been working with leaders in the church and community to encourage people to get vaccinated while remaining respectful of cultural barriers, said Bell, who added they’re working with interpreters.
Officials aren’t expecting the rise in cases to stop anytime soon, Bell said. At least some of the people in quarantine, as well as their household members, are likely to develop symptoms of the highly contagious disease, she said.
Measles symptoms, which include a fever and rash, generally start between one and three weeks after infection.
Although the health department encourages people exposed to the virus to stay home and limit interactions with others, some who are unaware of their exposure may continue going in public, potentially passing the disease along, Bell said. Enclosed spaces with a lot of people interacting, such as churches and schools, can become hotbeds for the virus.
Until enough people are vaccinated to stop the virus’ spread, “this could go on for many, many more weeks,” Bell said.
The U.S. could lose its measles-free status this month, a designation meaning the virus is not freely circulating the country year-round. The country was first declared measles-free in 2000, 32 years after the vaccine became available.
Most people receive two doses of the measles vaccine, which also covers mumps and rubella, during childhood. Unvaccinated adults can still get both doses, which protects from the disease in about 97% of cases.
Getting a shot within 72 hours of exposure to the virus can help prevent illness, and anyone who does so can skip the 21-day quarantine, Bell said. Few people have taken that option, she added, without providing numbers.
South Carolina is also a hotspot for flu cases, according to the CDC.
As of Saturday, the most recent data available, 15,589 people tested positive for influenza since the flu season began in September, according to the Department of Public Health.
That’s more than double the number of cases reported last year, though it still falls far below the 45,000 influenza cases reported during the 2023-2024 season, according to the health agency’s data.
This season, 26 people have died from the flu. All but one were at least 50 years old. One was a child from the Upstate, though the health department did not release any more information about the child’s age or location.
“To prevent complications and deaths, it’s critical that everyone in South Carolina get their flu shots as well as updated vaccines for respiratory illnesses, including COVID and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV,” Bell said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MobileHealthUnit-measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:12:47.229597

Missing from the first day were the partisan fireworks that defined the end of last year’s session and a special session in September. Instead, both the House and Senate functioned normally on Wednesday, quickly running through motions of a first-day and adjourning with little fanfare. 
But the partisan schism simmered under the surface. 
Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe is pushing for elimination of the state’s income tax and is expecting to lay out his plan next week when he speaks to a joint session of the legislature for his annual State of the State address. 
Democrats — still smarting from last year’s GOP moves to cut off debate to pass bills repealing expanded paid sick leave, gerrymander the state congressional map, change the initiative petition process and reimpose an abortion ban — said they are withholding judgment until they see the details of Kehoe’s plan. 
But they note the income tax represents 65% of last year’s $13.4 billion in state revenue. 
Missouri faces budget crunch as capital gains tax cut hits harder than expected 

Democrats will not support raising taxes that disproportionately impact lower-income Missourians to pay to eliminate the income tax, said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat.
“People are already having a really hard time making ends meet in this state,” Beck said. “People are living paycheck to paycheck. So if anyone wants to raise taxes on those folks, that is unacceptable to us. As Democrats, we say there should be no new taxes.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said that while the possible elimination of the income tax is “being sold as…getting rid of your taxes,” most Missourians will see little benefit.
“What they’re not telling you is how much more you’ll have to spend every time you swipe your card,” Aune said, adding: “The next time you have an expensive car repair or costly emergency visit from a plumber to fix a broken pipe, you’ll also be paying double digit sales taxes on that bill. Struggling to pay your rent? The struggle will get even harder when Republicans add a sales tax onto that.”
Democrats will lay out their own income tax proposal next week, Aune said, that will offer “targeted tax relief for those who need it most.”
State Rep. Mark Boyko, the Kirkwood Democrat who will sponsor the measure, said that while Missourians earning over $250,000 could end up paying more under the Democrats’ tax plan, it would generate much-needed revenue. 
The proposal, Boyko said, “will actually lower your costs.”
Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, urged her colleagues in an opening day speech to work together to “find solutions that move Missouri forward.”
While tax cuts weren’t directly mentioned in her speech, O’Laughlin left little doubt where she stood.
“Taxes, regulations, red tape and bureaucracy do not make Missouri better,” she said. “In every case, they take from Missouri families, they also take from Missouri small businesses. And our job is to reduce that impact. We must make sure what we take is as limited as possible.”
Missouri families want results, O’Laughlin said. 
“They want better roads, better schools,” she said. “They want more private home ownership. They want safe streets and neighborhoods. They want better jobs and stronger job skills. They want thriving communities, and they want less dependence on the government at all levels.”
Hovering over the income tax debate is a state budget picture looking gloomier than it has in years. 
General revenue is projected to be $400 million below estimates made a year ago. Part of the reason is that a capital gains tax cut passed last year that was estimated to reduce revenue by $111 million annually is now believed to cost as much as $500 million the first year and $360 million a year moving forward. 
Beck said that while Democrats decided against using procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate on the first day, the chamber will move much more slowly this year — not only in response to last year’s GOP moves quash Democratic filibusters, but also to avoid mistakes like the cost of the capital gains tax cut. 
“When you shut off debate or refuse to engage with the other side to just rush things through, mistakes happen,” he said. “We were screaming from the hilltop that the capital gains cuts were going to cost way more. But we went too fast, and senators weren’t allowed to do their jobs.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-512285042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:12:47.229597

(Courtesy of Mayday Health)A dispute over abortion-rights advertising in South Dakota has spawned dueling state and federal lawsuits.
A New York-based nonprofit filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Jackley from taking legal action against the nonprofit’s abortion-rights campaign at gas stations across the state.
Jackley asked a South Dakota judge last month to stop the campaign, which includes gas-pump placards asking “Pregnant? Don’t want to be?” and provides a link to Mayday Health’s website. The nonprofit educates people about the safety and effectiveness of abortion pills. It began its ad campaign in early December, and Jackley sent the group a cease-and-desist letter days later.
State seeks court order to stop abortion-pill ad campaign

In the new federal suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, Mayday claims Jackley’s actions are unconstitutional because the nonprofit’s website and advertising materials are protected.
“We’re not taking the signs down,” said Mayday’s Executive Director Liv Raisner in a December Instagram post. “It’s First Amendment-protected free speech, and information is not illegal.”
Mayday’s lawsuit says Jackley “may not punish Mayday for publishing truthful information on a public issue” such as “ information about legal abortion services in jurisdictions that have made abortion illegal.”
In his cease-and-desist letter, Jackley said abortion pills are illegal in the state, and that Mayday Health publishes incorrect and dangerous information.
“These ads are targeting women — including teenagers — encouraging them to take these pills while misleading them about the potential physical risks,” Jackley said in a December news release. “At the same time, they promote secrecy by urging women not to inform their doctors and children not to tell their parents.”
South Dakota lawmakers adopted an abortion trigger ban in 2005 that took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortions are prohibited in the state, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. State lawmakers also passed legislation in 2022 banning “medical abortion by telemedicine.”
In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used in medication abortions, are also listed on the World Health Organizations’ list of essential medicines. In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by anti-abortion medical organizations to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing guidelines for mifepristone.
Jackley has not yet filed a response to Mayday’s federal lawsuit.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 21:58:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Erin Stewart qualifies early for public campaign financing,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/erin-stewart-qualifies-early-for-public-campaign-financing/,The GOP's Erin Stewart qualified for public financing from the Citizens’ Election Program earlier than any previous candidate for CT governor.,"The gubernatorial campaign of Republican Erin Stewart cleared a significant hurdle Wednesday by qualifying for public financing from the voluntary Citizens’ Election Program earlier than any previous candidate for governor.
The State Elections Enforcement Commission unanimously approved Stewart’s application, immediately providing her an $806,875 convention grant and the promise of at least another $15.4 million if she wins the GOP nomination.
To qualify, Stewart had to raise at least $250,000 in small-dollar donations that could range from $5 to $340 each, a task others have struggled to accomplish before June, leaving little time to staff up for an August primary.
“It’s a statement of credibility and broad public support,” said John Healey, the Stewart campaign’s general consultant and senior advisor.
Stewart is the beneficiary of revisions made after 2022, the last of two election cycles dominated by wealthy self-funders who could not only spend far more than publicly financed rivals but could start sooner. 
The grants were about $1.3 million for a primary and $6.5 million for a general election, and the earliest grant could not be paid until a candidate qualified for a primary at a nominating convention in May. 
As a result, Republican Bob Stefanowski, a self-funder new to politics, began spending in January on his campaign for governor in 2018, five months before two publicly financed rivals, Mark Boughton and Tim Herbst, got their grants.
Under the revisions, the grants more than doubled to about $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for a general election. And for the first time, an $806,875 advance on the primary grant would be available immediately upon qualifying, as Stewart did Wednesday.
Her campaign immediately announced staffing hires.
“We’ve been running for the past year on ‘loyalty and love,’ as the mayor says,” Healey said. “This gives the campaign the ability to staff up and run a full-fledged field operation.”
Stewart, 38, the former mayor of New Britain, is competing for the nomination with state Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich, who also plans to seek public financing. Betsy McCaughey, 77, a Newsmax host and former lieutenant governor of New York, has told Republicans she is likely to run.
Jim Conroy, a spokesman for the Fazio campaign, said the quarterly finance report due on Jan. 10 will show him also surpassing the $250,000 threshold — and doing so “faster than any other statewide campaign.”
Fazio began fundraising after opening his campaign in August. Stewart didn’t declare her candidacy until November, but she began raising qualifying contributions for public financing in January 2025 through an exploratory committee.
Stewart, who was mayor for 12 years, did not seek reelection in November, hewing to a plan and timetable drawn a year ago: raise money through an exploratory committee, declare her candidacy immediately after the municipal elections in November, and apply for public financing in December.
“She posted a very strong fundraising record throughout the course of the year,” Healey said. “She has ticked every box, despite the naysayers saying, ‘She’ll hit a wall at some point.’”
Stewart filed her application in late December. The approval Wednesday came after an audit ensuring that the qualifying contributions met the requirements of the law. Ultimately, she raised $287,153 in qualifying contributions.
Connecticut’s public financing system, a reform created in response to the bid-rigging scandal that forced Gov. John G. Rowland from office in 2004, is nearly universally used by state legislative candidates. 
Participants must abide by spending limits. One of the other reforms was a ban on contributions by state contractors to any candidate for state office, whether they sought public financing or not.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy won the open seat for governor in 2010 as a publicly financed candidate, defeating self-funders in a Democratic primary and then in the general election. He was reelected in 2014, again with public financing.
The program has since become irrelevant in gubernatorial elections.
Democrat Ned Lamont and Stefanowski opted out of the voluntary program in 2018 and in their 2022 rematch. Lamont spent $25.7 million to win reelection to a second term; Stefanowski spent $14.5 million that year.
Lamont spent $8 million on television ads in the last five weeks of the campaign, more than the total spending Citizens’ Election Program would have allowed over the entirety of the campaign.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6620-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 16:59:12.678536

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — In plain view of the public, progressive State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha tore down part of a Nebraska Capitol display distributed by the conservative nonprofit PragerU and the White House on the first day of the legislative session. 
Gov. Jim Pillen had said the purpose of hosting the display, sponsored by the state’s Semiquincentennial Commission, was to let the state “celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary.” The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S.
Cavanaugh told the Examiner she removed the frames because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.”  She said generally any such display would be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways. 
“I have always been a stickler for the rules … so I removed the prohibited objects,” Cavanaugh said.

A Cavanaugh office aide said the removed portraits were “gone” when asked by the Examiner Wednesday morning, but they were in her office. Cavanaugh, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, said someone would pick up the paintings from her office. 
Speaker John Arch of La Vista confirmed that Cavanaugh told him that she had removed the portraits. Arch said the commission can display in the Capitol with approval, which he said the group had received from the Nebraska Capitol Commission.

Pillen, in a social media post, shared Capitol security footage of the incident from the Nebraska State Patrol. In them, Cavanaugh can be seen removing the paintings.
“Celebrating America during our 250th year should be a moment of unity and patriotism, not divisiveness and destructive partisanship,” said Pillen, a Republican. “I am disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.”

President Donald Trump marked the new year by launching a military assault on Venezuela and abducting President Nicolás Maduro. Some 75 people in Venezuela were killed in the Saturday attack and 7 U.S. service members were injured, according to the Washington Post. Many Democrats and some Republicans have denounced the act as unconstitutional, while Trump has followed up by threatening more military action against Cuba, Mexico, Columbia and Greenland. 
This week also marks the fifth anniversary of the January 6th insurrection on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters who were attempting to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 presidential election. 
I spoke with Vermont Sen. Peter Welch about these escalating domestic and international crises under the Trump administration just before he returned to Washington. 
The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David Goodman  
Let’s begin by getting your thoughts on the US actions against Venezuela this weekend.
Peter Welch  
It’s reckless and it’s wrong. I mean, let’s acknowledge the military did a very professional job, but the decision the President made to depose the leader of another country, authoritarian that he was, and then to say that this is about us running Venezuela, and then to say that he wants our big oil companies like Exxon to take over Venezuelan oil brings us back to gunboat diplomacy. It’s very, very dangerous. I’m adamantly opposed to what the President did.
David Goodman  
What did you as a United States senator know about this operation in advance?
Peter Welch  
Absolutely nothing. I’m a United States senator and the United States Senate is the institution that has the authority to authorize a military action. This was an act of war. We were never consulted. We were never involved. So we knew no more than any other citizen who woke up that morning. And what you’re seeing is that the President is completely acting beyond the authority of an executive. In my view, Congress has to stand up and resist that. But we don’t have Republican support, and we need that. I am a co sponsor of a resolution condemning this and I’m going to be urging my Republican colleagues that we not relinquish our authority and have a president who is exceeding the powers that the Constitution gives him.
David Goodman  
How is this supposed to work? For example, what happened when President George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003?
Peter Welch  
The President comes to Congress and asks for an authorization to use force, and in the case of President Bush, he did that before he went to Iraq. I was opposed to that and many members of Congress were, but a majority supported him. But the President did come to Congress. There’s a reason for that. When we’re going to put our men and women in harm’s way, that’s a major decision. Deciding to use military force is an easy decision for a president like Trump, but the consequences of it are paid for by our country and by men and women who are willing to serve at the call of the Commander in Chief. That decision should be deliberated. There should be a discussion, there should be a debate. There should be accountability by members of Congress that they said yes or they said no to this request by the President. What there shouldn’t ever be is the arbitrary capacity of an individual who happens to be president to plunge us into a war.
David Goodman  
President Trump said in his address to nation on Saturday that this is all going to be free. It’s going to be paid for by Venezuela. Do you believe that?
Peter Welch  
No, absolutely. He said that about the (border) wall too. Let’s just discuss this. There is a decision that only the President made. Number one, the decision was to take out Maduro. Number two, everybody in Maduro’s government is still in power. Number three, the President says we’re going to run the country. How are we going to do that? Number four, he says our oil companies like Exxon are going to take over the Venezuelan oil fields. None of those things can happen and none of them should happen. So the President is saying, “they’re going to pay for it.” This same president won’t lift a finger to extend the health care tax credits that have already expired and where we’re going to have about 25,000 Vermonters without health care as a result of that. No, this is bogus.
David Goodman  
Right now there are Vermonters in the Caribbean, the Vermont Air National Guard. What do we know about the role that they are playing in this operation?
Peter Welch  
First of all, we are all so impressed and appreciative of our Guard. They got 11 days notice right around the Christmas holidays and had to pick up and leave their families behind. There was no notice for them. What we do know is that none of them have been injured, and I am so pleased that that is the news that we have, and we are awaiting a report about what role they did play. But of course, we have the Air National Guard and they have air assets, and obviously those were a big part of this operation, so we’ll find out. But I don’t know exactly what they were requested to do.
David Goodman  
The President has described the strategic principle here as the “Donroe Doctrine,” his update of the 200 year old Monroe Doctrine. What do you understand Trump’s doctrine to be?
Peter Welch  
The Monroe Doctrine was an assertion by President James Monroe that European powers could not colonize countries in this hemisphere. What the “Donroe” Doctrine is is the United States can impose its will on countries in this hemisphere. Totally different. It’s more about gunboat diplomacy. It’s more about imperialism. These are the President’s words: “we’re going to run the country in Venezuela,” “we’re going to have our oil companies there.” That has absolutely nothing to do with the Monroe Doctrine. If the President is, in a kind of pathetic way, trying to make a new word of “Donroe,” the Don is more like a mob boss than it is a diplomat or a statesman.
David Goodman  
The United States does not have state-run oil companies, but President Trump is saying that private American oil companies are going to rebuild the infrastructure of Venezuela’s oil industry. Does that make sense to you?
Peter Welch  
No, absolutely not. I first started getting interested in Latin America during the President Kennedy administration. There had been a history of the United States companies essentially toppling governments to their own advantage. United Fruit in Nicaragua, of course, the United States toppling an elected government in Guatemala in 1954. What President Kennedy did was really started moving us to where we were promoting democracy. The Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps — they became the United States engagement in Latin America and South America, which were more premised on the ideals of democratic participation and democratic rule. President Trump has repudiated that totally and completely. What he wants to do is have transactional engagements with these countries that benefit him or benefit American companies. The aspiration for democratic rule or facilitating the path to democracy is totally rejected by this President. It is completely the wrong way to go.

In the first year of President Trump’s second term, the United States has taken military action against seven different countries, including three that we’ve never waged war against. After attacking Venezuela, Trump threatened action against Cuba, Mexico and Greenland. What can or will constrain him?
Peter Welch  
It has to be Congress and the American people. But right now, the biggest dilemma we have in Congress is that my Republican colleagues have abdicated the constitutional authority that we have as members of Congress in so many areas that the President is acting more like a king. Under Article One of the Constitution, Congress has to vote on war making and authorize it in Appropriations. It’s up to Congress, the power of the purse. The President is disregarding that. In area after area, my Republican colleagues have been willing to abdicate their authority and their responsibility and delegate it to the President. So you’re having this undemocratic concentration of power in a president who knows no limits and thinks that because he is president, he can do whatever he wants. That’s a real threat to our democratic governing system.
David Goodman  
This seems to have opened up some cracks in the MAGA coalition. We are hearing about opposition from Marjorie Taylor Greene and Representative Thomas Massie, also Senator Rand Paul, who have opposed this break with the idea of “America First.” Do you think this could cause other fractures within that coalition?
Peter Welch  
I do. Americans do not want us getting involved in foreign wars. They support our military, and we need our strong military to make certain that we’re defended. But this action in Venezuela is not to protect us from a threat to our country from Venezuela. His talk about taking over Greenland is not to protect us from a threat by Greenland or Denmark, and likewise, Colombia. Most Americans know that asking our citizen soldiers to go to war for presidential preferences is absolutely wrong. We’ve got to take care of things that are really tough for everyday working people in our country. Right now, Vermonters are losing health care. The President hasn’t lifted a single finger to extend those tax credits so that Vermonters and Americans won’t lose health care. The president ran as a person who was against these “forever wars” and now he’s embracing these wars, not just in Venezuela, but also the threats In Colombia, the threats in Greenland and in Cuba. Why?
David Goodman  
Why do you think he has pivoted in such a dramatic fashion from a core principle that he has run on?
Peter Welch  
The biggest support group he has is the billionaires. If Venezuelan oil is now suddenly run by American oil companies, they benefit. And I’m not even certain the oil companies want what he’s doing. The President is very, very good as a politician in stoking division, but his real loyalty where his policies have consistently been applied is when it comes to enhancing the wealth of the very wealthy. The tax cut bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill went largely to billionaires. When he talks about foreign policy, he talks about getting American companies in Venezuela in on the oil. When he meets with leaders from Middle Eastern countries, they talk about crypto deals or meme coin deals that involve his family. That’s an obvious motivator for the President. It’s really tough for Vermonters now with health care, with the cost of housing, and our small businesses that are contending with these tariffs that are really punishing their ability to sell their products and compete. They don’t have the telephone number of the Secretary of Treasury where they can call up and get an exemption like a lot of Trump friends can. Our job is to get us focused back on the well being of American citizens, of having a fair and square economy where people work hard, and if they do and they have a good product, they can get ahead and their success doesn’t depend on whether they’re connected to the President or whether they made a big fat campaign contribution.
David Goodman  
This week marks the fifth anniversary of the January 6 insurrection in which Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol. You were in the Capitol that day. How did that experience change you, and in your view, change the country?
Peter Welch  
I was shocked, as we all were. I was in the gallery in the House of Representatives about 30 feet from where the shot was fired. I was on the floor above, but it was right below me. I couldn’t believe it. And I was there when the mob was breaking the doors down. They were ultimately unsuccessful, but they broke the glass. I was seeing our security people with guns drawn. And what to this day still stuns me is that even though I was there, even though in real time I was hearing the shot, I was seeing the glass being broken, I didn’t believe it was happening. It couldn’t happen because this is the United States of America, and we’ve never had an insurrection to stop the peaceful transfer of power. We’ve been so blessed with this tradition where the winner is certified as the winner, and where violence is not used to change the outcome of an election. That changed that day. And what was also painful was to see these Capitol Police officers who I see every day, and they’re just wonderful people that work hard, and they then became vilified, as though they were the attackers and the people who attacked them, who kicked them, who spat on them, who bit them, who tried to rip their helmets off and nearly break their necks — those people were pardoned for attacking a police officer. That continues to be shocking to me. And you’ve got President Trump trying to rewrite history. We can’t on this fifth anniversary allow that to happen. And I’ll be with many of my colleagues who will be on the Senate floor describing what happened that day, what we experienced, and what the true history is of that event.
David Goodman  
That’s such a powerful image of you not believing your own eyes. For decades, you have believed in one kind of American story, and even though it was unraveling in front of you, you couldn’t believe it. Do you feel like you still respond that way to some of what you’re seeing?
Peter Welch  
It’s changing. Our democracy is under threat with what Trump is doing. There’s no question. But here’s what is now animating me. I think about those police officers who reported for duty, and then even through what they’ve been through, they keep coming back. I still look at the Capitol when I walk to work, and I just think about the incredible commitment this country has had in its constitution, in its declaration of independence to the aspiration of equality of all men and women, and how so much of our history has been about the effort to achieve that, to make it more real, to make it more encompassing for more people. That’s a worthy goal and it is under assault now. But I think about folks who came before me like John Lewis, and Martin Luther King, and how they devoted their lives to the perfection of our democracy. It’ll never be perfect. But isn’t it a worthy aspiration, even if it’s under assault?
David Goodman  
Do you think something like January 6 could happen again?
Peter Welch  
It could happen again. This a jump-ball situation. What’s going to be the outcome is not inevitable, and that’s why it takes all of us to do whatever it is we can. We’re in a very dangerous place in our democracy and what the outcome is going to be, I can’t predict. But I can tell you this, we in Vermont are going to do every single thing we can. What Vermont does is (have) fierce debate about how to solve this or that problem, but also a shared sense that we’re all in it together and that we have a shared obligation to the future of our state. We need more of that in Washington.

Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin) and his wife, Rebbie, announced Wednesday that the politician wouldn't seek the governor's seat this year. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)State Sen. Doug Mastriano said Wednesday he won’t make another bid for governor in a livestreamed event with his wife, Rebbie.
“We remain in this fight with you and for you. We’ve prayed a lot, we’ve fasted, we’ve discussed it a lot. Many of you reached out to us, beseeching us and urging us to run,” said Mastriano during a Facebook livestream. 
“But we believe, with full peace in our hearts, that God has not called us to run for governor this year.”
The Franklin County Republican ran against now-Gov. Josh Shapiro in 2022 and was resoundingly defeated. He didn’t endorse state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, saying “we’ll talk about that down the road.” She won the party’s nomination in September. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But having a Republican governor would mean that “the grassroots is going to have to back the candidate,” Mastriano said, without naming Garrity.
The Mastrianos spent most of the announcement reminiscing, relitigating the COVID-19 pandemic and recounting tales from the 2022 campaign trail without explicitly saying whether or not he’d run again. Opponents of his 2022 campaign repeatedly highlighted Mastriano’s role in supporting President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, including his presence outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the building and drove Congress from its chambers to disrupt the vote certification. 
More than 500 people watched the hourlong video, which included 2022 campaign ads and roughly 25 minutes with the Mastrianos.
Doug Mastriano said he was still a state senator and is not up for reelection in 2026. His current term ends in 2028. 
Shapiro is expected to announce his reelection campaign on Thursday. Aside from Garrity, no other Republican has announced their intention to run for governor — nor has anyone yet indicated a plan to run for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination.

Kerwin Pittman, the formerly incarcerated man who bought the Wayne Correctional Center in Goldsboro, created a buzz Wednesday during a N.C. Joint Reentry Council meeting. 
Pittman, who says he’s the first formerly incarcerated person to purchase a prison, also learned that the money he spent to buy it will be put back into other prison facilities.

Leslie Cooley Dismukes, secretary of the NC Department of Adult Correction, shared the news about the proceeds from the sale. Dismukes said state law allows the department to use the proceeds to improve prison facilities.
“I think that is a pretty awesome, whole-circle moment,” Dismukes said.
Pittman did not know that was a possibility until Dismukes shared the news with the reentry council and dozens of visitors who attended the council’s first meeting of 2026. 
Pittman is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit Recidivism Reduction Educational Program Services, Inc. (RREPS). He committed to helping others leaving prison after serving 11 years, six months in prison for conspiracy to commit murder.
He bought the prison to create re-entry housing and a workforce campus where formerly incarcerated people can attain job skills or industry certifications. Pittman envisions residents training to become electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, construction workers or other trades that are in high demand.
Pittman estimates it will take up to two years to get the former prison ready for as many as 300 residents who would live on the campus until they complete a six-month program. Another class of up to 300 would replace the previous residents each six months, he said.

Senate wants teacher raise, opposes vouchers",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/misissippi-school-choice-battle-house-senate-teacher-raise/,"Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, R-West, surveys the House floor on the first day of the 2026 regular session, Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026, at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson, Miss.","As the Senate passed a teacher raise and several other plans on Wednesday, the House unveiled its long-awaited omnibus education package aimed at greatly expanding school choice in Mississippi and reshaping the state’s education system.  
The fight over school choice, policies that often give families public dollars to pay for private schools or other alternatives to public education, has been brewing in Mississippi for years and reached a fever pitch in recent months.
The two chambers of the Legislature drew lines in the sand Wednesday, setting up a battle in the weeks or months ahead. While the Senate wants a tweak to allow more public-to-public school district transfers, the House is pushing for wide-ranging changes, including letting parents spend public money on private schools.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Education Chairman Dennis DeBar said vouchers or other means of spending tax dollars on private schools won’t fly in the Senate.
The House’s gargantuan 553-page bill is expansive, covering everything from curriculum changes to athletics eligibility for homeschooled students. 
Most notably, the bill would establish education savings accounts, called Magnolia Savings Accounts, that would give parents public dollars to pay for private-school tuition. Parents could also use the money to pay for therapy, homeschooling, or any alternative education services. 
House Republican leaders, including Speaker Jason White, have been pushing for an ESA program, the most expansive form of private school choice available. He said on social media Wednesday that the package “prioritizes freedom, results, and Mississippi’s future workforce.”
Republican Hosemann would not comment on the House bill but said that his chamber would not consider programs that would allow public money to pay for private school education. 
“We have pressed for public education for the last five, now six, years,” he said. “So this is not anything unusual about us continuing to fund education, to fund teachers (with) a pay raise, to ensure that children can go to a school that will give them the particular thing that they want, if it’s accepted by that school district.”

The Senate on Wednesday passed two of its three education bills without much fanfare during its second floor meeting of the session that began Tuesday. This included a $2,000 a year pay raise for teachers, teaching assistants and university and community college professors, estimated to cost $132 million a year.
The final measure, the Senate’s school-choice bill that would remove a home district’s power to veto public school student transfers, passed 33-19, mostly along party lines. Sen. Walter Michel, a Republican from Ridgeland, was the sole Republican dissenting vote.

All of the chamber’s 18 Democratic senators opposed the measures over concerns that only affluent families with the resources required to travel lengthy distances to school districts outside their own would benefit from the policies. They argued that looser enrollment rules would make poorer school districts even poorer while richer school districts continue to gain more resources because students’ state education allotment follows them from school to school. They also expressed fear that expanded school choice could bring a racial resegregation of schools. 
“When students leave, funding leaves soon,” Sen. Derrick Simmons, a Democrat from Greenville, said. “That loss of funding does not come from excess. It comes directly from classrooms. It comes directly from the teachers.” 
DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, said the Democratic senators’ fears were built on exaggerations, and that the Senate leadership has a strong history of supporting public schools.

Credit: Richard Lake/Mississippi Today
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, a Republican from Starkville, said he was encouraged by the Senate’s passage of its education measures and hopes it means the two chambers are “slowly but surely coming together on some key issues.”
When asked about the lieutenant governor declaring the Senate was not open to passing voucher legislation, Roberson said he’s seen legislators change their minds on policy positions later in a session.
“I’ve seen many times that the House side has been totally opposed to one thing, and after they’ve had some time to think on it … I’ve seen a total swap in terms of how we look at things,” Roberson said. ” I certainly don’t think anything is ever closed.” 
House leaders have not publicly provided a detailed estimate of the cost of the school choice and other proposals in the new bill, but Roberson said Wednesday that the vouchers would likely be about $7,000 each, the base cost the state now pays for public school students. Providing private school vouchers for 12,500 students, as the bill proposes, would cost $87.5 million.
The chambers do agree on a few points: The behemoth House bill includes much of the Senate’s proposals, including slackened public school transfer regulations and a provision to make it easier for retired state employees to teach without losing pension benefits. 
However, the House bill only includes raises for assistant teachers, and its portability plan for students to switch public schools requires more transparency from the receiving school district. Namely, the receiving districts must publish their admissions criteria and report acceptance data. While rejections must be justified, the Senate version does not require that criteria and data. 
READ MORE: FAQ: What is school choice? What are Mississippi lawmakers considering?
Another significant aspect of the House bill: It expands the literacy act that helped lead to Mississippi’s nationally noted public-school reading improvements. In 2013, lawmakers funneled money and support to the state’s public schools, focusing on kindergarten through the 3rd grade. It famously established a third-grade reading test that students are required to pass to graduate to the next grade, and created and funded a system of reading coaches and training for teachers. The impact was huge — the state’s reading rates shot up, leading national pundits to dub the gains a “Mississippi Miracle.” 
The House’s package expands targeted literacy initiatives to grades 4 through 8, a move for which the Mississippi Department of Education has been pressing. 
The package also advances charter-school expansion, previously shot down by the Senate Education Committee because of poor performance from the state’s existing charter schools. 
Currently, Mississippi law only allows charter schools to be established without board approval in areas with failing school districts. The House proposal widely expands that eligibility. Under the new bill, charter schools could be established in any area, regardless of the public schools’ performance. 
Additionally, the package makes changes to the charter school authorizing board. As it stands, the bill gives the board more authority over opening and closing charters and establishes more rules for the board. 
The package also includes math and financial literacy initiatives, fixes to the state public school funding formula and language encouraging prayer in school. 
The House Education Committee, which met Wednesday, did not take up the omnibus education bill. Instead, the panel of representatives invited a group of parents who were almost all in favor of school choice to speak at a hearing.
Next, the Senate’s education bills head to the House for consideration. The House’s massive education reform package must be considered by the chamber’s education committee before it can be taken up on the floor.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderRepublicans will maintain their hold over a Cherokee County state House seat after Bill Fincher, a former district attorney, defeated Democrat Scott Sanders during a runoff election Tuesday.
Fincher, who now owns an RV park, received over 70% of the vote according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office. He will replace Republican state Rep. Mandi Ballinger of Canton, who died in October after a long battle with cancer. 
In an interview, Fincher said he was “absolutely humbled” by the support of the voters in his district.
Among his top priorities for the 2026 legislative session are capping property taxes, reducing traffic around metro Atlanta and lowering the cost of insurance premiums.
“I’m going to try to get the insurance companies to recognize that we passed tort reform and signed it into law, and we’ve not seen any reduction in our insurance [costs],” Fincher said, referencing two Gov. Brian Kemp-backed bills intended to limit damages Georgia juries can award that passed during the 2025 legislative session. “It should have been something that was a quid pro quo, and we haven’t seen any reduction.”
The district, which includes Canton, part of northern Holly Springs and the surrounding unincorporated areas, heavily favors a Republican. But Democrats hoped to capitalize on growing momentum across the state, having recently flipped two seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission as well as a House seat in an Athens-area district once thought to be safely under Republican control.
Sanders, a business executive, said making it to the runoff was an accomplishment for a Democrat in such a ruby red district.  
“With every realistic and stretch political goal accomplished, I feel like this campaign was a massive success,” Sanders said in a statement. “And it was fantastic groundwork for the upcoming races in 2026. We made sure that every election will have to be contested and not a giveaway.”
The Legislature will reconvene for the start of the 2026 session on Monday, Jan. 12.

Meanwhile, CT may extend open enrollment past Jan. 31.","With uncertainty in Congress around reviving expired federal health care subsidies, Connecticut officials are considering another extension of open enrollment for 2026 Affordable Care Act plans.
Federal lawmakers are trying different avenues to bring back the enhanced premium subsidies in some form after they lapsed at the end of the year. But depending on what Congress may do over the coming weeks, the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT, said it is in discussions with carriers about potentially extending the final deadline beyond Jan. 31 for another month or two.
The pandemic-era subsidies had been in place since 2021, and because they lapsed, premiums will spike for many this year in Connecticut and across the U.S. The renewal of the Affordable Care Act tax credits had been at the heart of Democrats’ demand during last year’s government shutdown. But when lawmakers brokered a deal to reopen it, they only got a promise of a vote, not a guarantee of extending them.
Even without the enhanced subsidies, more Connecticut residents enrolled. As of Jan. 2, the total number was almost 150,000 enrollees for 2026 plans, which is about 3% to 5% higher than the same period last year, according to Access Health CT CEO James Michel.
“One of the potential changes out there is what the feds are doing. If they do something within the next week or two — in terms of extending the subsidies — then we may have to look at extending [open enrollment] beyond February and March,” Michel said at a Monday press conference alongside Gov. Ned Lamont and Interim Insurance Commissioner Josh Hershman. “We want our customers to come back in, shop, and maybe buy something with more coverage because they will have more subsidy available for them to repurchase.”
All three officials urged residents to enroll in health care and reach out to a broker to see if they qualify for assistance, especially since Connecticut is providing some relief.
The final deadline for open enrollment has already been extended a couple of weeks, until Jan. 31. If an individual or household enrolls in a health or dental plan by the end of the month, coverage will start Feb. 1.
Before the subsidies expired at the end of 2025, Lamont announced the state would step in to fill in some of the gaps through its $500 million emergency response fund set up during the special session to address federal cuts: an initial $70 million for this calendar year, with tens of millions of dollars more slated to cover some in 2027.
The plan will maintain CoveredCT through June 2027. That program provides no-cost plans to low-income families that earn slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid.
Nearly $51 million will go toward replacing the federal subsidy entirely for those who make between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. And it will also cover half of the current financial assistance for people earning between 400% and 500% of FPL. The latter will lose all federal assistance now that the enhanced subsidies are gone.
“The consumers in Connecticut that are most vulnerable and in the lowest income class should be made entirely whole based on the gap that was created from the non-extension of the federal subsidies,” Hershman said.
Lamont reiterated that this won’t make up the difference for everyone but will help defray at least some of the costs for health plans that are losing support from the federal government.
Connecticut is one of only a few states offering a subsidy to offset the loss of enhanced federal subsidies. Others include Maryland, California and New Mexico.
“We’re not going to be able to make up all of the federal shortfall forever,” Lamont said. “You’re probably going to see your rates stay the same or even go down for everybody earning up to about $160,000 a year.”
One of those Connecticut residents who could get some relief through the state is Malaine Trecoske from Branford. Trecoske is a 64-year-old who works part-time at a small retail shop and has a year to go before she can qualify for Medicare. For Trecoske and her 63-year-old husband, they would need to pay $42,000 a year to stay on their silver plan now that the enhanced federal subsidy expired.
She said they’re considering what makes most sense for their bottom line: keep their income below 400% of the federal poverty level to still be eligible for some subsidies or earn more money that could put them over 500% but then no longer qualify for assistance.
Because Connecticut will make up about half of the subsidies for those earning between 400% and 500% of FPL, Trecoske said that could cut down what her family owes to about $21,000 for the year — if they remain within that income range. She said she’s thankful the state stepped in, but her premiums would still be costly.
“For us, regardless, it’s a big amount,” Trecoske said at a virtual press conference on Wednesday hosted by U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District.
For Stephanie Saujon, she and her husband will see an increase of about $1,000 a month in their health care premiums. She’s a self-employed professional photographer in Stratford who’s been in business for 18 years. Saujon said they have to “shuffle things around and budget to afford these premiums.”
But unlike Trecoske, Saujon won’t receive any relief from the state because she’s over the threshold to qualify. She said her business is doing well but was happy to see a fund in place to help others who are struggling. Still, the spike in her premiums “is really not sustainable,” especially as someone with a chronic illness.
“We’re trying to do everything we can with the changing landscape down in Washington,” Lamont said, noting the debate over the subsidies is reminiscent of the back-and-forth over federal nutrition assistance that was imperiled during the government shutdown.
The fate of the expired tax credits remains in flux, though they are once again likely to stall in Congress barring a breakthrough in the Senate.
Democrats’ push for a three-year extension failed to advance in a key Senate vote last month. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he wouldn’t take up such a bill.
But through a procedural tool called a discharge petition, lawmakers were able to force a vote on the House floor this week. All Democrats plus four Republicans signed onto the petition for a three-year extension, garnering the 218 signatures need to trigger a vote.
On Wednesday afternoon, the House was expected to take a procedural vote on the discharge petition to renew the subsidies for three years. If it clears, lawmakers plan to vote on final passage on Thursday. But the Senate is unlikely to take it up since it already blocked such an effort.
That has put pressure on bipartisan groups in the Senate seeking a compromise that may unlock what has been a non-starter for GOP leaders in both chambers. Some of the proposals would renew the subsidies for less than the three years sought by Democrats and could include income limits and other changes to eligibility. One potential deal taking shape would extend the tax credits for two years and impose income caps, according to Politico.
DeLauro said she would support a one- or two-year extension if it meant reviving the enhanced subsidies and seeing some movement in the Senate. But she hopes the final vote in the House on Thursday will create more pressure on GOP senators to reconsider extending the tax credits for another three years.
“This pressure has got to come from public outcry,” DeLauro said Monday. “If the subsidies expire and cuts remain in place, we’re in the midst of our people in Connecticut … living through a cost-of-living crisis.”

(Courtesy photos/collage by Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Ahead of the upcoming 30-day legislative session, a state lawmaker has introduced the first in an expected series of proposed bills that would prohibit banning books in public libraries.
State Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) pre-filed House Bill 26 last week, which, along with prohibiting book banning, would also require publicly run libraries to establish a procedure for people to challenge library materials “believed to be obscene, unlawful or incompatible with the library’s purpose;” prohibit retaliation against library employees; and would make public libraries ineligible for state funding if they do not follow state law. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will have to explicitly include the issue in her “call” for the session starting Jan. 20, which is otherwise limited to budgetary matters. Her office did not immediately respond to a query about whether she intends to do so.
Cates sponsored a similar bill last year, the Librarian Protection Act, but the proposed legislation failed to make it to the House for a floor vote. Cates told Source New Mexico that HB26 is “almost identical” to the previous bill, but described it as “refined” due to more stakeholder input.
“We wanted some protections on employment for librarians as well, so that’s really our biggest change, is making sure that librarians are not fired or passed over because they’re following their policies rather than political whims,” Cates said. 
The bill also clarifies that the state Department of Cultural Affairs’ library division is responsible for the bill’s enforcement.

Cates said she has received emails from library staff across New Mexico who shared personal stories of threats to themselves and their employment because they followed their respective libraries’ process for challenging books and other material. Local authors have also voiced their experiences with censorship of their published work and calls for removing their books from public library catalogues. 
The Rio Rancho Public Library system faced a challenge to some of their books by a small group in 2023. Much of the criticism focused on books with LGBTQIA themes and characters. The city’s governing body passed a resolution later that year reiterating its support for library staff and stating the procedures for challenging books and other library resources was sufficient. 
“[HB26] is aimed at assisting communities ensure their public libraries maintain free and open access to information free from political influences; and would protect librarians who have dedicated their lives’ to upholding the First Amendment,” Jason Shoup, Rio Rancho library director, told Source in a written statement.
Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque) told Source she is working on a similar bill to address prohibiting book banning in K-12 public school libraries. A third expected bill would address academic libraries tied to public universities and colleges.
Kit Rosewater, a middle-grade and young adult author based in Albuquerque, told Source that her debut middle-grade novel, “The Derby Daredevils: Kenzie Kickstarts A Team,” was challenged in Staten Island, New York, after it was added to the curriculum for all New York City public schools. 
“They didn’t burn books, but basically they raided their school library and took out a bunch of books by marginalized authors with marginalized characters and content and they kind of like ceremoniously threw them into this giant dumpster,” Rosewater said. Her book was included because Rosewater identifies as queer and the novel has a transgender character. 
In New Mexico, Rosewater was scheduled to host an author visit and writing workshop at a public Albuquerque elementary school in September 2025, but a group of parents disapproved and protested. “They had, I would say, about a five- or six-week harassment campaign against me that unfortunately was targeted completely at the librarian who had invited me,” she said. “I felt like the librarian was getting really nervous…so ultimately I was the one to cancel the event just for everybody’s safety.”
Rosewater described this instance as “soft censorship,” or actions taken against books and authors that are outside of the formal challenging process. “We want people to know that it is an issue here. This isn’t kind of some niche thing that we’re bringing over from some other area.  All the people who are behind this legislation and this work, we’re all very deeply kind of plugged into what’s happening in New Mexico, in schools and libraries,” she said.
Rosewater connected with the anti-censorship organization Grandparents and Allies for Truth and began reaching out to other advocacy groups to form a coalition. Freedom to Read New Mexico officially launched in November 2025 with Rosewater as chair. She and representatives of other coalition members have since worked with lawmakers to shape HB26 and the other two pending book banning bills.
“New Mexico is an extremely diverse state in terms of how different counties, regions, towns all operate. And so we really needed to kind of connect with each other about what was going to work best for New Mexico as a state versus any one particular school or library or even city,” Rosewater said. “We feel that [HB26 is] extremely timely and there’s just no way we can just sit on our hands and let this session pass us by without at least trying to get it on the call list.”
She added that states across the country have acted recently to pass anti-book ban legislation. According to American Libraries, nine states have passed such legislation since 2023, with an additional five states passing bills in 2025.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Banned-Book-illustration-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 16:59:12.678536

Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, presides over Indiana's Senate Education Committee on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation requiring schools to more strictly limit student cellphone use cleared a key Senate committee Wednesday after being amended to protect students with medical needs.
Senate Bill 78, authored by committee chairman Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, passed in a 12-1 vote and now heads to the full Senate chamber. 
The measure would require all public schools to adopt a ban that prohibits students from using or possessing a wireless communication device during the school day and requires that any teacher-directed use of a device “for educational purposes” occur only on school-supplied devices.
It also mandates that each district choose between two enforcement models: a “no device policy,” in which students may not bring phones to school at all; or a “secure storage policy,” in which students may bring phones but must store them so they are “inaccessible throughout the school day.”


The education committee on Wednesday also discussed legislation that seeks to revive proposed limitations on social media use for Hoosier children. A similar proposal passed the Senate in 2025 but died in the House. Amendments and a vote on the bill could come as early as next week.


The bill expands the definition of “wireless communication device” to include smartwatches connected to a phone, cell tower or the Internet.
Under current state law, students are prohibited from using phones during instructional time, but they can use them during lunch and passing periods.
Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, cast the lone no vote, though he said he could change his mind as the bill moves forward. All other Democrats on the committee joined Republicans in supporting the measure. Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said he had some concerns but ultimately backed the legislation, calling it “good policy.”
The amended bill also clarifies that school cellphone policies cannot block students from using devices when necessary to manage a documented medical condition, so long as the student has an order from a licensed Indiana health care provider. Raatz cited students who rely on phones for diabetes monitoring, for example.
Supporters testified in December that stronger technology policies are needed because the rapid proliferation of smartphones has outpaced school rules and fueled student distractions and behavioral issues. 
Some districts already use secure “bell-to-bell” storage systems, like locking pouches, during the school day. That process typically requires students to turn off or place their phone on airplane mode, secure it in the pouch under staff supervision, store it in a backpack or locker during the day, and unlock it at dismissal.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia Sen. Mike Woelfel, a Democrat representing Cabell County, will not run for reelection this year, he said Wednesday. 
Woelfel, an attorney, was first elected to the Senate in 2014. He’s in his third term as senator. 
“I didn’t really ever plan to be there 12 years,” he told West Virginia Watch. “I thought maybe one or two terms at the most. So I think it’s just maybe time to turn the page and let somebody else have a crack at it. So that’s what motivated me to just make a decision.”
During some legislative sessions, Woelfel has introduced bills that would limit terms for lawmakers, but the bills have not moved, he said. He said Wednesday he plans to re-introduce the legislation next week. The 60-day legislative session begins Jan. 14. 
“I just feel like you shouldn’t be in there forever,” Woelfel said.
Woelfel is the assistant minority leader for the Democrats. He’s one of only two members of his party in the 34-member Senate. 
In his final session, Woelfel said he hopes that lawmakers will pass legislation aimed at improving West Virginia’s overburdened foster care system. Around 6,000 children are in foster care in the state. 
“As we both know, those children are in there, in foster care through no fault of their own,” he said. “And we’ve let them down. The system is broken. I expect to put a lot of effort into legislation that would help repair that system.”
According to WSAZ News, Chris Miller, a West Virginia businessman who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2024, announced Wednesday he would run for Woelfel’s district 5 seat this year. Miller, a Republican, could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
Miller is the son of U.S. Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va. He owns multiple car dealerships in the region. He lost to now-Gov. Patrick Morrisey in the 2024 primary election. 
The official candidate filing period begins Monday and continues through the end of the month. 
The primary election is May 12 and the general election is Nov. 3.

Education development games for school toddlers kids (Photo by Vanessa Nunes/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma state agency is accepting proposals to open a five-story child care facility at a building near the Capitol that would “offer priority for admission, at all times, to children of State of Oklahoma employees.”
The Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services is investing over $45 million legislatively appropriated dollars into renovating a building on the Capitol Complex, located at 2409 N. Kelley Ave., which will be turned into a facility for 250 children, from infants to 5-year olds. Proposals are being accepted through Feb. 20. 
This comes as Oklahoma, which is considered a child care desert, faces a shortage of qualified workers and lawmakers continue to grapple with finding solutions. 
A rendering of the building on Kelley Avenue, a future child care facility, in Oklahoma City is pictured. (Screenshot)
The Legislature originally began planning for the project in 2023, appropriating money to OMES “to accept transfer of the Kelley Building and Kelley Annex owned by the Department of Human Services and renovate the facilities for lease to a public operator as a day care facility,” according to the bill language. 
The appropriation does not pay for day-to-day expenses of the child care facility, only renovations. 
Bonnie Campo, a spokesperson for OMES, said in a statement that a vendor that was previously awarded the contract withdrew in November for “financial reasons.”
Demolition is complete at the Kelley Building and Annex, Campo said, but work continues on the annex mechanical, electrical and framing systems. 
“When completed, the main building will serve as office space for state agencies, and the annex will serve as a day care facility for state employees,” she said in a statement. “All renovation is scheduled to be completed by August 2026. However, opening the facility is contingent on selecting an operator.”
The building currently houses the Child Support Enforcement Division, which will be moved, Campo said. 
OMES would be charged with renovating the building, providing fencing for an outdoor playground area, building maintenance, utilities, lawn care, pest control and other related services, according to the request for proposals. 
The operator of the proposed child care facility would be responsible for hiring and paying employees and the other day-to-day expenses of running a child care center. 
They would also need to provide interior furnishings, liability insurance, equipment for both an indoor and outdoor play area, janitorial services, and other similar responsibilities. 
Rep. Daniel Pae, R-Lawton, said he wasn’t aware of OMES’ request for proposals as of Wednesday morning. Pae is the vice chair of the House Committee on Children, Youth and Family Services. 
“When it comes to state employees, specifically, they do a lot of tremendous work to keep operations functioning and oftentimes they’re not paid as competitively as they ought to be, compared to their peers and other industries,” he said. “So we want to make sure that they’re taken care of.”
The cost of child care has grown nationwide and COVID-era subsidies in Oklahoma have been cut, raising costs for families across the state. Some providers have voiced their concerns about how the loss of subsidies could lead to more child care centers closing their doors. 
“I think in the current economy, if we’re going to truly maximize our potential as a state, to meet our workforce needs, we have to address child care,” he said.

Connecticut laws establish vaccination requirements and exemptions for school children across the state, regardless of the type of school they attend.
General Statutes 10-204a states that local and regional school boards and any “similar body governing a nonpublic school or schools” require students to have certain immunizations like those protecting against measles, mumps, and polio before being permitted to enroll.
In 2021, lawmakers passed Public Act 21-6, which removed the option for new students to claim a religious exemption. There are only medical exemptions for students with documented medical contraindications to specific vaccines.

(Main photo by Douglas Sacha of Getty Images; Story County Sheriff's Office insignia courtesy of Story County)Story County officials have agreed to pay $75,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by a former deputy who alleged harassment and discrimination in the sheriff’s office.
The lawsuit involved former county deputy Ashley Murry, who sued the Story County Sheriff’s Office and deputies Kyle Thompson, Leanna Ellis, Nathan Gruis, Adam Luke and Cody Hamilton in Story County District Court.
Murry, who worked as a deputy sheriff from April 2022 to November 2023, alleged she was the target of harassment from her supervisors and her coworkers, and was subjected to unwelcome derogatory and crude comments and insults that created a hostile work environment.
Murry alleged that after she was hired, and prior to leaving for training at the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy, Ellis instructed her to “keep your legs closed” while at the academy.
The lawsuit also alleged that during field training, Murry was required to handle a disproportionately higher number of calls compared to her male counterparts and that she was subjected to negative stereotypes associated with female officers, with her male colleagues telling her she wasn’t assertive enough and was bad at driving.
Murry also claimed that during work hours, the male deputies — including Hamilton, Luke and Gruis — would “sit in dispatch or in the office and watch football and yell profanities.”
The lawsuit alleged that during the annual sexual harassment and discrimination training for the staff, male deputies called a female colleague a “lesbian that could fix go-karts.”
There were also “many occasions that her male co-workers refused to provide” Murry with backup, jeopardizing her safety, the lawsuit claimed. In June 2023, Murry allegedly initiated a traffic stop in which the driver called four male associates to the scene. The four men allegedly drove to the location of the traffic stop and ignored Murry’s instructions to remain in their vehicles, prompting her to call for backup. The lawsuit claims Hamilton was available at the time, but refused to assist Murry, later telling her “sometimes you have to handle things on your own.”
While responding to a different incident in which an individual pulled out a large knife, Murry twice called dispatch for backup “but no one ever came to assist her,” the lawsuit alleged, adding that Ellis later berated Murry for her handling of the situation and told her she needed to be “more assertive.”
In September 2023, Thompson allegedly informed Murry a statistical analysis of her use of sick time showed a “suspicious” use of sick days on Mondays and Fridays, and allegedly referred to Murry as a “buddy f—er.”
The lawsuit, which was first filed in August 2024, alleged that the “hostile work environment and constant degradation” gave Murry no other option but to resign in November 2023.
The county and its co-defendants denied any wrongdoing and stated in court they “did not discriminate at any time against (Murry) nor did they harass” her.
According to the written settlement agreement in the case, Murray has agreed to drop all claims against the defendants in exchange for $75,000.
Settlement bars former deputy from disclosing terms
In October, before the agreement was formally approved, the Iowa Capital Dispatch requested a copy of the document. At the time, Assistant County Attorney Crystal Rink stated that “the requested record is a privileged attorney-client communication and is confidential.”
The Capital Dispatch responded by providing Rink with a “No Secret Settlements” advisory from the attorney general’s office that says under Iowa law, “in government, settlements are not secret,” and that “public disclosure is the rule, and confidentiality is the exception.”
On Oct. 31, 2025, Rink then responded by stating the county “does not possess a final, binding, written settlement agreement” in the case.
On Jan. 7, 2026, the Capital Dispatch renewed its request for the document, noting that Murry’s lawsuit had been dismissed by the court on Jan. 5, 2026, at the request of her attorney. That same day, Rink provided the Capital Dispatch with a copy of the settlement indicating it was signed and approved by the county board on Nov. 7, 2025.
The settlement includes a confidentiality provision that bars Murry from publishing its contents “on any social media or internet site or to any news media outlet.” The provision also allows Story County to “discuss or provide information internally” on the settlement or to comply with open records laws.

Jim Justice, R-W.Va., is joining a bipartisan coalition of U.S. senators in introducing legislation that aims to make farmers safer by preventing fatal tractor rollovers, according to a news release. 
According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 417 farmers died nationally between 2011 and 2018 due to tractor rollovers. Five of those fatalities — one each in 2011 and 2012 and three in 2013 — occurred in West Virginia, per the data.
The proposed legislation — dubbed the Roll-Over Prevention and Safety Act — would require the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to create cost-sharing grants to assist farmers in retrofitting older tractors with rollbars and other equipment that could prevent passengers from being fatally crushed or injured by tractor rollovers. It would also start a federal grant program to help farmers as well as agricultural schools add rollover protection to their equipment. If passed as-is, the federal government could pay up to 70% of the costs needed to purchase, ship and install rollbars and seatbelts on existing tractors.
Per research from Kansas State University, there are nearly 5 million tractors used regularly on farms across the country, but only half of them are equipped with rollover protection structures. When rollover protections are in place, they’re estimated to reduce fatalities by nearly 99% when rollovers occur.
Tractor rollovers are considered to be one of the leading causes of death and injury within the agricultural sector. In 1985, American tractor manufacturers adopted voluntary standards to include rollover protection structures on all newly created tractors. Many farmers, however, use older and outdated equipment without these protections.
In 2017, the National Rollover Protection Structure Rebate Program launched, allowing farmers in several states to receive up to 70% back for the price of ordering and installing rollbars on their equipment. Industry groups have been advocating for nationwide funding to support the program for several years. 
In a news release Wednesday, Justice said he personally knows how critical it is to protect farmers since he himself is one. In July 2025, he told members of the Senate Agriculture Committee that his family “has been in the farming business for 7,000 years.”
“This bill is one simple way we can help decrease the risk of fatal tractor rollovers on farms,” Justice said in Wednesday’s release. “I’m proud to support the effort in the Senate and hope that this grant program will encourage more farmers to consider retrofitting their tractors with roll bars to protect themselves and their equipment operators.”
Other Senators introducing the legislation alongside Justice include: Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Co. and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss.

“We know that (one size fits all) mandates fail,” McMahon said. “States should lead. Washington should support their sound approaches and get out of the way. That’s why the Trump administration is granting Iowa this flexibility. And we hope that as we partner with congressional leaders to return education to the states, we can work with them to expand these opportunities for states and local leaders to run their education systems.”
Iowa had submitted a waiver in March to receive nearly $157 million in federal education funding through block grants that would have allowed the state to allocate this funding outside of federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) requirements. While the approved waiver covered a much smaller portion of federal education funding, Gov. Kim Reynolds said the “Returning Education to the States” waiver is the “first step” toward implementing the larger plan.

Kim Reynolds, left, and Iowa Department of Education Director McKenzie Snow, right, on approving a state waiver for Iowa to change some federal education spending requirements.

McMahon had requested in 2025 that states submit applications for waivers allowing more flexibility in federal education spending, and Iowa was the first state to apply for the spending rules exemption.
Iowa’s proposed “unified allocation plan” proposed giving the state the ability to more effectively address education needs in the state and reduce administrative costs, Reynolds argued in September, and said state testing scores show Iowa’s education system was in a good place to take on these funds with less federal regulation.
The waiver announced Wednesday has a much smaller scope than the state’s initial proposal, making changes to reporting and spending requirements in three areas, state Education Secretary McKenzie Snow said.
Four ESEA federal educational funds — Title II Part A, dealing with professional development, Title III Part A dealing with English language learning , and Title IV, Parts A and B covering student support and community learning centers — are consolidated into a single. state-level block grant. This block grant, which totaled roughly $3.8 million for federal fiscal years 2024 and 2025, is proposed to go toward funding professional development for the state’s “science of reading” approach to literacy development as well as for providing all teachers professional development courts on teaching English language learners.
McMahon said a majority of the funding through this $9.5 million block grant is currently going toward complying with federal regulations, according to state estimates.
“If we were operating under the old rules, it would take — according to the figures that were done in the state — about $8 million to comply with the regulation of this $9.5 million dollar grant,” McMahon said. “So in essence, you get about a million-and-a-half dollars to go to the schools. With this new waiver, that $8 million will go to the schools. That’s a big number.”
The proposal also “streamlines” certain reporting and compliance processes, which the officials said will open up both time and money currently being spent by schools and the state on following federal regulations. Additionally, the waiver allows the Iowa Department of Education to give local school districts that receive federal funding from these pools “targeted local flexibilities” in how this money is spent, Snow said.
This will provide school districts, especially smaller, rural districts, the ability to “purposefully plan” their spending and invest in higher quality instructional material, more intensive tutoring options and other needed education supports, officials said.
McMahon made the announcement during a visit to Iowa Wednesday, joined by Reynolds and Snow. The group toured classrooms of Broadway Elementary School alongside local school officials, including Denison Schleswig Community School District Superintendent Kim Buryanek. The Denison elementary school is a dual language school, and the officials went to classrooms where students were learning both English and Spanish, as well as STEM and language arts classes.
Reynolds said the Denison school showcases the importance of investments in English learning and “science of reading” instruction. A 2024 law that focused on bringing K-6 students not reading at grade-level proficiency up to literacy benchmarks resulted in increased third-grade literacy rates statewide, Reynolds said. She cited an “especially inspiring” jump from 65% to 72% at Broadway Elementary School.
“That is a 7% increase, and that number continues to rise,” Reynolds said. “It shows the power of evidence-based instruction in schools, and school districts’ commitment to it. All the K- through 5th-grade teachers in Denison are completing their second year of letters training in the ‘science of reading,’ and fully embrace this approach.
“Our progress also says a lot about Iowa, about the dedication of our teachers and administrators, their collaboration with the Iowa Department of Education and our family’s engagement and student success,” Reynolds added. “But these improvements shouldn’t be limited to the state level, and that’s why I really appreciate that Secretary McMahon and her team are focused on supporting the right work. Work like the science of reading and work-based learning, which truly makes a difference for our students.”

Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City). (File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A prominent member of the House of Delegates has abruptly replaced his campaign treasurer amid concerns that she misappropriated money from his campaign account.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) told Maryland Matters he replaced Melissa Evans after being alerted to questions about $44,000 in checks written on his account and allegedly cashed by Evans.
“I am shocked and disappointed at this betrayal of trust by the treasurer of my campaign committee,” said Clippinger, the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee who was recently named speaker pro tem, the No. 2 position in the House. “I will immediately retain an accounting professional to review the treasurer’s management of my campaign account.”
Clippinger added that he has forwarded the matter to the Office of the State Prosecutor.
In a brief phone call, Clippinger referenced the open investigation and referred a reporter back to his statement.
Evans, who according to her online profile is currently employed with the Baltimore County Public Library system, did not immediately respond to a request by phone for comment.

Maryland Matters contacted Maryland State Board of Elections officials seeking clarification about Evans and her relationship with the campaign. The questions arose over 15 checks totaling $44,000 that were drawn on the account of Friends of Luke Clippinger. The checks were written over a four year period between 2020 and 2024.
All of the checks provided to Maryland Matters were made out to Evans, who appears to have endorsed the checks and deposited them into bank accounts she controlled. The checks range in amounts from $500 to two for $10,000. One of the checks was a bank check drawn on the Clippinger campaign account payable to Melissa Evans.
Evans had been Clippinger’s campaign treasurer since 2013.
Typically, campaigns do not pay their treasurers. Maryland campaign law allows for payments but requires a written agreement to be approved by the board of elections as treasurers are legally the only officer allowed to disburse funds.
A board of elections official Tuesday confirmed that no such agreement existed in the agency’s records.
Clippinger, in a statement, told Maryland Matters that board officials contacted him following that inquiry. It was then that he discovered “there were at least four checks written in the past month by my treasurer that were not authorized and not legitimate campaign expenditures.”
Those checks appear to be in addition to the $44,000 in checks obtained by Maryland Matters.
On Monday, Evans was listed as treasurer for Clippinger’s campaign.
A day later, her name had been removed. Sophia Silbergeld, who has worked as a fundraiser for Clippinger, is now listed as treasurer.

(Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)President Donald Trump is unlikely to see many U.S. oil companies jump in response to his call to invest in Venezuela for the foreseeable future, industry experts say.
With low oil prices and better drilling opportunities elsewhere — along with the legally fraught idea of taking a sanctioned foreign nation’s natural resources — it would take several years,  a shifting geopolitical landscape and either higher demand or a disruption to existing supplies before there’s any significant expansion into Venezuela, according to two energy sector economists and a former federal official and lawyer who specialized in oil industry investigations. 
Following surprise military strikes on Caracas early Saturday and U.S. forces capturing its autocratic leader, Nicolas Maduro, Trump and several of his cabinet members have focused the public’s attention on Venezuela’s oil. The South American country is believed to have one of the world’s largest proven reserves of crude oil, which Trump has suggested could be extracted by American fossil fuel interests.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said in a televised address Saturday morning.  
Estimates place Venezuela’s reachable oil reserves at roughly 2.3 billion barrels, which is the equivalent of 100 billion gallons, according to the Baker Institute for Energy Studies at Rice University.   
The political and logistical details of extracting and refining Venezuela’s oil is more complex than Trump’s depiction. For one, the price of oil is currently too low for all but the largest oil majors to expand their drilling and exploration, said David Dismukes, an economist and professor emeritus at the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University.
Overall, 2025 was a sluggish year for the oil industry with crude prices starting at an average $79 per barrel in January and steadily losing ground due to an oversupply through the year, closing out December at $63 per barrel. The going rate sat at $57 per barrel as of Tuesday. 
These prices are for benchmark crude, the “light” version that is more easily refined into finished petroleum products. The “heavy” crude oil from Venezuela typically trades $5 to $10 per barrel less than the benchmark rate, making it less valuable for exploration companies.
“We’re not running out of drilling opportunities in the U.S.,” Dismukes said.
Even if an oil company has the desire and resources to expand into South America, other countries such as Brazil offer virtually all the same potential benefits with none of the baggage of Venezuela, Baton Rouge-based economist Loren Scott said. 
“The evidence is clear on that,” Scott said. “Offshore Brazil is extremely active right now.” 
Dismukes said oil prices have largely moved “sideways” for the past few months, with small upticks quickly followed by small contractions. Absent financial incentives, the current numbers aren’t enough for most companies to start new drilling operations, particularly in a foreign country such as Venezuela, he added.
“The global market for energy is just really soft right now,” Dismukes said. “It’s just not really good timing right now to do something like that.” 
In the face of such skepticism, Trump has floated the idea of giving federal subsidies to oil companies to cover the cost of their expansions into Venezuela.
“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” Trump told NBC News on Monday.
The oil and gas industry is already heavily subsidized and is set to receive over $34.8 billion per year in federal handouts, thanks in part to the enactment of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, according to a report from Oil Change International, a group that opposes fossil fuel subsidies. More than $1 billion of that goes strictly to the costs of drilling new wells under a decades-old subsidy, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 
Throughout his campaign, Trump said he would unleash American energy “dominance” with new drilling across the U.S., promising to bring gasoline prices below $2 per gallon. Gasoline prices have been trending downward since July 2022 and saw a $0.25 cent drop over the 2025 calendar year. The nationwide average sits at $2.81 per gallon as of Wednesday.
Generally, when oil prices fall, consumers benefit from cheaper fuel. But the profit margin shrinks for oil companies, often leading to production shutdowns and sometimes layoffs or bankruptcies. It is especially pronounced for companies in Democratic nations compared with state-controlled oil producers in authoritarian countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that have, in the past, flooded the market with an oversupply of oil to manipulate prices and drive western competitors out of business.
Per-barrel oil prices in the low $50 range are unsustainable for most oil producers, and new exploration and drilling typically only starts when prices climb above $80 per barrel, Scott said. 
“It’s not a happy price right now for people in the oil industry,” Scott said.
Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally, was quick to praise the president’s strategy in an editorial he penned Monday for Breitbart News. The governor claimed that a “successful reboot” of Venezuela would have a “tremendous impact” on Louisiana’s economy and create high-paying jobs at the state’s ports and refineries.
The largest concentration of refineries with the capability to process Venezuela’s heavy crude are in Louisiana and Texas. The 15 crude oil refineries in Louisiana can process nearly 3 million barrels of crude oil per day, which accounts for one-sixth of U.S. refining capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Texas can handle 6.3 million barrels daily, providing a third of the nation’s refining.
A new stream of heavy crude could prove beneficial for certain U.S. refineries that use it as a blending agent to process light crude, according to Mark Zappi, a petroleum engineer who heads the Energy Institute of Louisiana at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette.
Many Gulf Coast refineries were originally built to handle heavy crude and later modified to process light crude as domestic drilling ramped up. Some still require a supply of heavy crude to operate, and most of it is imported from Canada, Zappi said.
Having a second source of this feedstock is generally good for reducing refining costs and at least would provide flexibility for times of uncertainty like when major weather events disrupt supply chains, he said.
“The only thing you can count on in the energy arena is not being able to count on anything,” Zappi said.
While there is some potential for Trump’s vision, experts say it will likely take many years to have any sizable impact on the Gulf Coast oil sector or the American economy. 
“It’s gonna take a while for this to happen — years,” Dismukes said. “It’s not gonna be a big opportunity that people are jumping up and down about.”
While Venezuela has large oil reserves, it can only produce a maximum of about 1 million barrels per day with its current infrastructure. The U.S. currently produces about 13.5 million barrels per day from domestic drilling, according to federal data.  
There are also complex legal issues at play when it comes to extracting the natural resources of a foreign nation, said Braden Perry, a compliance officer and former senior trial attorney at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The federal agency investigates crimes related to trading on energy markets, cryptocurrencies and other commodities.
Companies would need express permission from the Venezuelan government or a clear United Nations Security Council mandate to legally extract any oil from within Venezuela’s borders, Perry said. Without either of those, it would be a violation of international laws governing state sovereignty, he added. 
Even if the Trump administration gets permission, American oil companies could run into a number of other compliance issues with other markets or governments. One potential choke point is the reluctance insurers might have to underwrite operations that might trigger penalties, including existing European Union sanctions on Venezuela. 
Insurance companies cover their own risks through the reinsurance market, most of which is based in the United Kingdom and European Union, which often imposes much stricter exclusions than American underwriters, Perry said.
Maduro, whom the U.S. and other nations refused to recognize as the legitimate president of Venezuela, still has his vice president and the rest of his administration running the country. Opposition leaders in Venezuela might challenge any drilling permits or agreements offered by the current government, further complicating the situation and the risk for investors.
“So it’s not simply a technical or geological issue, it’s geopolitical and legal,” Perry said. “These markets are not only controlled by regulators, but also by insurance, banks, reinsurers, and exchanges.”
In a social media post Tuesday night, Trump claimed Venezuela’s interim government authorities have agreed to turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil.” It will be shipped to the U.S. and sold at market prices, and the U.S. president would hold onto the money on behalf of the Venezuelan people, Trump wrote.  
Perry said it’s unclear what Trump means by “sanctioned oil” but that any Venezuelan-origin crude would be blocked from sale unless the sanctions are lifted.  
“I presume there could be some executive or legal order as part of the plan, but that is unclear,” Perry said. 
The president has broad authority to lift sanctions that have been imposed through executive orders, but some of the actions against Venezuela are congressional sanctions that require legislative approval to lift or amend them.
“Sanctioned oil doesn’t become marketable by announcement,” Perry said. “This will be a complicated process to provide formal sanctions relief, ensuring the market — and shippers, financiers and insurers — is comfortable and has mitigated the real risk associated with the purchase of Venezuelan oil.”
As for setting up shop in Venezuela, Dismukes, the LSU economist, suggested that if a new government forms there, it will likely take years before investors are confident it won’t devolve into authoritarianism. The U.S. could offer some sort of financial securities and incentives, but the potential benefits would still need to be greater than what’s already available in other places, he said. 
Some degree of geopolitical stabilization needs to happen before oil companies will want to invest or expand into Venezuela, Scott added.
Venezuela began the nationalization of its oil industry in the 1970s under President Carlos Andrés Pérez, who negotiated the transition with companies such as Exxon, Chevron and Shell. In the mid-2000s, President Hugo Chavez seized assets from several foreign oil companies, some of which continue to wage legal battles against the country to recover their losses. 
Only Chevron has remained there to operate, with Venezuela accounting for less than 10% of its overall global production, according to company figures. Chevron’s partnership with the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., accounts for nearly one-fourth of the nation’s output.
“Stabilization is the first key,” Scott said. “That’s critical … How do you give oil companies the confidence to go back in there, to say you don’t have to worry about somebody coming and taking your stuff?”

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Greetings from Arizona, where the old saying is that it’s so dry, you’d think the air is on a diet.
Seriously, this part of Arizona gets about 8-9 inches of rain annually and only about 30 days when there is any precipitation at all. The average January rainfall is less than an inch.
Well, guess what? Ole Miss plays Miami in the Fiesta Bowl Thursday night, and we may get that much rain – or more – that one day. Heavy thunderstorms are predicted.
Now then, it probably will not affect the game that much even though State Farm Stadium in nearby Glendale has a natural turf (Bermuda grass) field. State Farm Stadium has a retractable dome, which surely will be closed Thursday. The weather will affect tailgating. And it will be colder than normal. And those Mississippians coming in for just the day of the game should prepare accordingly. If the weather forecasters are accurate, it will be damp and cold.
Tailgating way outside the Grove
Speaking of tailgating (and perhaps soaked tailgaters), the National Football Foundation annually hosts one of the largest tailgating festivals in college football in conjunction with the Fiesta Bowl. It is held on The Great Lawn, a short walk from the stadium and is normally attended by thousands. The Ole Miss band and cheerleaders will participate. We are told there will be live entertainment of all sorts, some of both Miami’s and Ole Miss’s most famous football alums attending, plus photo booths, lawn games and team trivia contests. Again, raincoats and umbrellas are suggested.

‘I just felt like Ole Miss was home’
Asked how difficult his decision was to return Ole Miss next year (pending a waiver from the NCAA) quarterback Trinidad Chambliss responded: “It was a little bit of a hard decision because Coach (Charlie) Weis was always good to me. I had a great relationship with him throughout the whole season.As well as Coach (Lane) Kiffin, he’s been nothing but good to me. But I just felt like Ole Miss was home,and I felt like it was the right thing to do, and I felt comfortable being here. The Oxford community has beennothing but good to me and my family with the support and love that they have shown to everyoneon the team.”

Smiling since he was born
An observation: The national media, many seeing and hearing Chambliss for the first time up close and personal, seem totally smitten. As one national website reporter asked: “Is Trinidad this gracious and forthcoming all the time?”
Part of Chambliss’s charm is an ear-to-ear smile he flashes almost every time he answers a question. Joe Soules, Chambliss’s high school basketball coach, was asked by a reporter about that smile. “You can’t wipe it off,” Soules said. “It’s been there since he was born.”
No doubt that effervescent smile will serve Chambliss well in life, whether it is at Ole Miss next season, or in the NFL or whatever else he chooses do.
Remembering a talented Millsaps QB
Millsaps quarterback Juan Joseph won the C Spire Conerly Trophy back in 2008, causing quite the controversy. Michael Oher and Peria Jerry of Ole Miss were the other finalists, and many were incensed that media voters would choose a Division III player over SEC standouts. That was even though Joseph led the Majors to an 11-1 record that season, running and throwing for nearly 4,000 yards and 38 touchdowns.
Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson remembers Joseph ever so well. He was Joseph’s position coach and offensive coordinator for two seasons at Millsaps.
“Great player, great kid from a great family,” Dawson said here Tuesday at Fiesta Bowl Media Day.

Given that Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss came from Division II Ferris State and has become one of the most famous players in college football today, I asked Dawson: “What about Juan Joseph? Would his talent have translated to this level of football. Could he have played in ACC or SEC?”
“Oh yeah,” Dawson answered. “He could have played. No doubt about it. Juan could have played anywhere.”
Joseph was tragically shot and killed in 2014 while he was trying to break up a fight outside a Baton Rouge nightclub. Millsaps still presents the Juan Joseph Memorial Award annually “to the most outstanding returning football student-athlete that exemplifies the altruistic spirit on and off the field that Joseph exhibited in his life.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20185526/AP25355020748731.jpg,,,2026-01-07 15:58:24.324298

Photo courtesy of Pacific Legal Foundation. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month in a case against Michigan’s Isabella County that alleges the county violated the constitutional rights of a Michigan family when it seized and sold the family’s home as a tax foreclosure penalty for nearly $120,000 below its assessed value. 
The Pung family home was seized by the county over an unpaid $2,242 tax debt, which was owed after a property tax exemption was not applied to the property for several years. 
The tax exemption had been granted to Timothy Scott Pung, who bought the home in the 1990s and lived there with his family until his death in 2004, after which point his son Marc and his family moved into the home. Lawyers for the Pung family argue that, under Michigan law, the tax exemption should have automatically been applied, as the property was staying within the family. 
But the local tax assessor disagreed, and as foreclosure proceedings continued, the house was eventually sold at a public auction for about $76,000. The assessed market value of the house was over $194,000 at the time.

After the Pungs sued, a federal district court ruled that the family should be granted the amount that the house sold for minus the owed tax, just under $74,000. The Sixth Circuit Court agreed with this, writing, “when a municipality sells foreclosed property at a properly conducted public auction, the owner is entitled to the amount of the sale above his debt and no more.”
But the Pungs are now arguing that the failure of the county to pay the family the over $118,000 between the auction price and the market value of the home amounts to an excessive fine, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and is not “just compensation” as is required by the Fifth Amendment. 
“The simple way of thinking about it is that you have, in this case, a situation where the government took, confiscated an entire home as payment for a debt that never should have been imposed in the first place,” said Christina Martin, a senior attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the Pungs alongside Michigan attorney Phil Ellison. “It was wrongly imposed, and they should pay for the whole thing they took.”
The county, however, argues that if the court rules in favor of the Pung family, it would make tax foreclosure no longer a viable way to collect unpaid taxes. 
“If the former property owners are entitled to more than surplus proceeds actually yielded by the sale, tax foreclosure becomes a moneylosing proposition,” a brief filed by the county’s lawyers explains. “Foreclosure would become nonviable as a means of tax collection — with no readily apparent alternative means for timely collection of the delinquent revenue.” 
The legal team for the Pung estate breaks down the money that they argue is owed, labeled as “uncompensated equity,” from the sale of the home in question. Screenshot of court filing.
But Martin said that this case is more about property rights than about taxes, with someone’s home often being their most important asset.
“I’ve always seen this as a property rights case, and I don’t view it as a tax case, because this was never about tax collection. If it were, they knew Pung was good for the money,” she said, referencing the fact that Pung was paying a legal team at that point. “I don’t really think this was ever about tax collection. I think it was about taking the whole property.”
The county’s lawyers also reference that taxes are not a “taking” under the Fifth Amendment, and that “the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause should apply only against monetary penalty or property forfeiture imposed as punishment following conviction for a criminal offense,” arguing that both constitutional arguments made by the Pungs’ legal team are invalid.
The oral arguments are scheduled to take place on Feb. 25.

Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, announced Wednesday he filed legislation that would bring the physical fitness test back to public schools statewide, aligning with an executive order from President Donald Trump. Pugh leads two Senate committees on education and is a Republican candidate for state superintendent of public schools.
At the time it was eliminated in 2012, the Presidential Fitness Test included a one-mile run, sit-ups, a shuttle run, a sit-and-reach test, and pull-ups or push-ups.
Oklahoma school districts would have to implement the test starting in the 2026-27 academic year if Pugh’s Senate Bill 1437 passes in the coming legislative session, which begins Feb. 2.
“Physical activity is one of the most important investments we can make in our kids’ future,” Pugh said in his announcement. “Being active and healthy isn’t just about strength or endurance. It’s about building a foundation for better mental health, stronger academic performance and long-term wellbeing.”

Trump’s July 31 executive order reestablished the test and reconvened the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, which will issue recommendations for the test’s administration.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the first iteration of a national youth fitness test in 1956 with an emphasis on military readiness. 
President Barack Obama replaced the test in 2012 with the Presidential Youth Fitness Program, which promoted living a physically active and healthy lifestyle rather than measuring athletic performance.
Pugh’s bill would direct the Oklahoma State Department of Education to create guidelines for administering the Presidential Fitness Test. Those guidelines would have to be based on recommendations from the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. The guidance must include training for personnel to administer the test.
Students’ fitness results shouldn’t impact their grade point average, Pugh told Oklahoma Voice.
Rather, school districts should use the test results to promote the physical and mental benefits of daily movement, exercise and good nutrition; modify activity opportunities offered to students; and encourage participating in physical activities inside and outside the school setting, according to the bill’s text.
“This legislation encourages healthy habits early in life and supports a culture of fitness that benefits students for a lifetime,” Pugh said when announcing the bill. “These are foundational habits that support overall health and that should always be our goal.”
Families would have the option to opt out their children from taking the fitness test, according to the bill. Further exemption guidelines would apply to students with disabilities, medical conditions or other factors impacting their ability to complete the test.
The Oklahoma Rural Health Transformation Program, a $233 million federally funded initiative, will provide $4 million to rural schools for exercise equipment, a cardio and walking-focused app for students, and professional development for physical education teachers — all with the goal of implementing the Presidential Fitness Test. 
The Rural Health Transformation Program provides federal dollars intended to offset Medicaid cuts that were included in the “big, beautiful” budget policy that Trump signed into law in July.

New Mexico public health officials are encouraging New Mexicans to reduce or abstain from alcohol consumption for Dry January. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)As alcohol consumption remains one of New Mexico’s leading causes of death, state public health officials are urging New Mexicans to reduce drinking for the remainder of the month.
The New Mexico Department of Health launched the Drink Less, Live More initiative Wednesday to provide statistics and resources to participate in Dry January, and “hit the reset button” for alcohol consumption.
“Reducing your alcohol intake can improve sleep, boost energy, enhance mood, and promote long-term health,” said Rebecca Neudecker, section manager for NMDOH’s Office of Alcohol Misuse Prevention in a statement.
Participating in Dry January, which originally started as a 2013 United Kingdom public health campaign, can provide immediate benefits including better skin quality, possible weight loss and more time and money for other hobbies, said Katie Witkiewitz, the director for Center on Alcohol, Substance use, And Addictions at the University of New Mexico.
“A lot of people are setting New Year’s resolutions to eat better, get more active, and so why not add cutting out drinking to the list of things that we’re trying to change in the month of January,” she told Source NM in a phone interview.
New Mexico ranks first in the nation for alcohol mortality, and had 1,756 alcohol-related deaths in 2024, the latest data available from the health department. Additionally, alcohol accounted for 9% of all hospitalizations statewide during the same time period, according to a news release from the New Mexico Department of Health.
One in three deaths in New Mexicans aged 20 to 39-years old is linked to alcohol, said Witkiewitz, which is higher than the national average of about one in five deaths.
“It’s definitely a priority for New Mexicans to be thinking about reducing their drinking, changing their relationship with alcohol, or even abstaining altogether,” she said.
But participating in Dry January doesn’t have to mean abstention.
“You don’t have to go Dry January completely — Drier January, and Damp January are also options,” she said. “Just taking the month to choose to drink less might be associated with considerable health benefits.”
Witkiewitz also noted the availability of no or low-alcohol drink substitutes.
“I have been seeing more options in New Mexico, which is great, but we really need more available so that we can continue to have those social benefits of drinking without the alcohol,” she said.
For people who are regular, heavy drinkers, Witkiewitz encouraged consultation with a doctor, as stopping suddenly may be dangerous.
“If you’re someone who’s experiencing or has experienced seizures, hallucinations, severe sweating or vomiting when you’re not drinking — that could be signs that you’re at risk for a severe withdrawal reaction to not drinking,” she said. “I always recommend people consult with a medical provider, you know, before engaging in Dry January in those cases.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 20:02:02+00:00,CT Mirror,CT joins 22 other states sued by U.S. over voter registration data,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/ct-voter-registration-social-security-justice-lawsuit/,President Donald Trump's administration wants CT officials to turn over voter data including driver's license and Social Security numbers.,"President Donald Trump’s administration has filed a lawsuit in federal court attempting to force Connecticut election officials to turn over all of the state’s voter registration data. 
Attorneys with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division in Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Connecticut on Tuesday after Stephanie Thomas, Connecticut’s Secretary of the State, refused to provide that office with all of the voter registration information that was requested.
In Connecticut, portions of the state’s voter registration database are publicly available to anyone who requests the information and pays a $300 fee. 
But Thomas, who has served as Connecticut’s Secretary of the State since 2023, has refused to give the DOJ another version of that data, which includes voters’ Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
In letters that were shared back and forth between August and December of last year with the Justice Department, Thomas argued that Connecticut law prohibits her office from sharing the Social Security and driver’s license numbers included in the voter registration data with anyone.
In its complaint in federal court, however, the DOJ attorneys disagreed and argued that federal law — specifically the Civil Rights Act — requires the state to turn over that information.
“Secretary Thomas’ refusal to produce the records demanded constitutes a failure tocomply with federal law,” the DOJ wrote in the complaint. 
Connecticut is not the first state to be sued by the Trump administration for declining to turn over voter registration information. In total, the Trump administration has filed lawsuits against 23 states and the District of Columbia over similar denials. 
Those lawsuits are part of a larger shift within the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, which has sought to investigate claims of voter fraud and recently advanced complaints from right-wing groups that have repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud.
“I am not surprised that Connecticut has been added to the long list ofstates being sued on these grounds,” Thomas said in a statement on Tuesday. “As Secretary of the State, my foremost responsibility is to the voters of Connecticut who entrust the state and their local election officials with sensitive data so they can participate in our representative democracy without fear that their information will be misused or exposed.” 
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong also said in a statement that the state sought to comply with the DOJ’s requests while adhering to state law.
“We tried to work cooperatively with the DOJ to understand the basis fortheir request for our voters’ sensitive personal information,” Tong said. “Rather thancommunicating productively with us, they rushed to sue. The state ofConnecticut complies with federal law and takes its obligations underfederal laws very seriously, and we will vigorously defend the state againstthis deeply disappointing lawsuit.”
Thomas’ refusal to voluntarily turn over the Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers for every registered voter in the state was roundly criticized by state Republican officials on Wednesday.
In a joint statement, House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, called the arguments that Thomas and Tong were making were “laughable.” 
“The resistance of Secretary Thomas and Attorney General Tong to federal voter integrity efforts should concern every Connecticut resident — especially given a system that allowed deep election corruption to thrive in Bridgeport,” the Republicans wrote. “If a Democratic administration had made this request, the data would have been on a FedEx truck within the hour.
“Secretary Thomas and Attorney General Tong slice and dice voter data for their own campaigns, so their attempt to position themselves as protectors of ‘sensitive’ information is laughable. They should comply with this request for public information, not obstruct it. Otherwise, residents will rightly wonder what their party has to hide,” they added. 
Meanwhile, Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, responded to the lawsuit by criticizing Trump and the unfounded claims that Trump won the 2020 election. 
“Once again, the Trump administration is using threats and coercion to try to collect Connecticut voters’ private data that it has no legal basis for requesting, and which we can only surmise has no beneficial motive for using,” they wrote. “Connecticut is one of nearly 20 Democratic states that Trump’s Justice Department is now bullying in order to create a national citizen database. Connecticut will fight for our citizens’ right to privacy, and we will not surrender to the countless election deniers and conspiracy theorists who inhabit the Trump administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5845-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 15:12:24.464662

Hoeme has set up a permanent conservation easement area on his land. (Submitted)TOPEKA — An organization dedicated to preserving the endangered lesser prairie chicken and other grouse species is changing tactics to work with farmers and ranchers on grassland preservation and needed policy changes. 
Ted Koch, executive director of the North American Grouse Partnership, is a retired biologist whose second career led him to the partnership. Once there, he realized that making moves to protect the prairie grassland ecosystem would have a cascading effect to support farmers and ranchers, as well as grouse populations. 
He recently visited state and national legislators to share about the challenges of protecting grasslands through increasing compensation for ranchers who put environmental conservation practices in place. 
It’s a different message for his organization, which has been focused solely on protecting 12 grouse species, including the lesser prairie chicken. It has been listed as endangered twice in the past 10 years, Koch said. 
As he talked to state agencies and others about grouse, someone pointed out that most of the prairie chicken habitat was on private land. Koch reached out to 10 ranchers for a call. 
“I said I want to save chickens and ranching,” Koch said. “And all the ranchers said, ‘Sorry, Ted, we’re not interested. We want to save ranching.’ Direct. Clear cut.”
The Grouse Partnership learned that if it wanted to save grouse, the group needed to expand  programs supporting ranchers who want to initiate conservation practices but can’t afford to, he said. 
Rancher and farmer Stacy Hoeme practices conservation on his farm’s acreage in Gove County and along the Smoky Hill River. He and his son have used  limited tillage and crop rotation, and through a research project they became interested in prairie chicken populations. 
Hoeme also committed to a permanent conservation easement, an option as part of the farm bill. 
He, like many farmers and ranchers, understands the benefits of taking care of the land and the grassland ecosystem.
“You need to have sustainable grasslands to have good water, which our water situation out here is critical,” Hoeme said. “(Grassland) helps put water back in the aquifer by slowing it down.”
Although he’s committed acres to long-term conservation projects, Hoeme knows that it’s not practical for many people to put land in the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP. 
He’s watching as many farmers and ranchers take land out of the CRP. 
“The value of CRP grass is half of what it is if it’s ag ground,” he said. 
Koch has been talking to legislators to explain the challenge and highlight the interconnected ecosystem. Saving ranching and the grasslands are intertwined, and policy changes need to be made, he said. 
The Grouse Partnership formed the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Landowner Alliance to create a workable plan with the mission to “save ranching, rural communities, water, and wildlife,” all in cooperation with ranchers.  
“Why are these conservative western Kansas ranchers willing to partner with a retired federal endangered species biologist to save the most threatened ecosystem?” Koch asked. “It’s wildly unacceptable to them that we’re losing 2 million acres of grasslands every year, and that there’s fewer livestock producers and lower cattle herds. That’s where we come together.”
The alliance wants to create ranching strongholds in the southwestern Great Plains, Koch said. That includes establishing 10 200,000-acre ranching areas that will be the “last best places of grasslands for rangeland cattle production, wildlife populations, aquifer protection, and sustained rural communities,” according to the  organization’s explainer. 
That work has been going on over the past five years using market-based models, where ranchers are paid fair market value for conservation services. They’d like to see those types of programs expanded, Koch said, so farmers are able to make finances work. 
“If we have to reduce our herds by 10 or 20%, we need to get paid for that,” Koch said. “My analogy there is it’s completely unreasonable for Americans to go to these ranchers and say, ‘We want you to recover this endangered species and we’ll give you 60% of the cost and take the other 40% out of your pot.’ Wildly unreasonable.”
It’s important to understand that ranchers want to be paid for producing conservation outcomes on their land, he added. They don’t want subsidies, cost shares or incentives. 
Much work remains to be done to create a system that supports preserving the grasslands — and of course, prairie chickens — and supports farmers and ranchers, Koch said. 
“They want to engage in the business negotiations just like anyone else,” he said, pointing out that when the federal government buys products from Ford Motor Co., it doesn’t tell the company how to make trucks.
“Let’s treat ranchers like they’re business professionals that they are, and contract with them to produce meaningful, measurable conservation outcomes on their working range lines while they continue to raise and sell beef and feed America,” Koch said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stacey-Hoeme-with-prairie-ckn-IMG_6411-1024x796.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 15:12:24.464662

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The NC Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of the General Assembly over Governor Josh Stein in a challenge involving judicial appointments and a restructuring of the state’s Utilities Commission.
Senate Bill 382 was passed at the end of the 2024 session, with the Republican majority overriding then-Governor Roy Cooper’s veto.
GOP leaders called  SB 382 as a “good government” measure and said that transferring the governor’s appointments to other members of the executive branch – all Republicans, notably – maintains the constitutionally required separation of powers.
The Stein administration filed several legal challenges to the law, arguing that the governor should control the majority of appointments to regulatory bodies that carry out the executive branch function of enforcing state law. Stein said the legislation amounted to “partisan power grabs [to] thwart North Carolina voters’ decisions at the ballot box.”
On Wednesday, the court ruled that the General Assembly did not violate the separation of powers clause by restructuring the Utilities Commission and giving Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, rather than the Democratic governor, the power to appoint members to the commission. Briner used that authority last year to name Donald van der Vaart, a former state Department of Environmental Quality Secretary and a climate skeptic, to the commission.
“The General Assembly can appoint and confirm statutory officers,” wrote Judge John Tyson. “The order of the three-judge superior court panel upholding the State Treasurer’s appointment to the Utilities Commission is affirmed.”
In a 2-1 split decision, the appellate court also ruled that the legislature did not violate the separation of powers clause by requiring the governor to appoint appellate judges “from a list of three qualified persons recommended by the political party executive committee of the political party with which the vacating judge was affiliated when elected.”
Attorneys for Stein had argued in a February 2025 filing that “absent a constitutional amendment approved by the people, the constitution leaves no room for the legislature to place restrictions, qualifications or limitations on the governor’s power to fill judicial appellate court vacancies.”
Judge Allegra Collins dissented from the majority opinion in addressing the Utilities Commission appointments and appellate judicial vacancies.
Collins reasoned SB 382 unfairly tips the scales to provide ‘legislative dominance.’
“The General Assembly’s asserted authority to reassign appointments among Council of State members at any time, including immediately after an election, for any reason, or no reason at all, gives the General Assembly the power to determine which executive official controls the swing vote on the Commission, including the swing vote on the selection of the chair,” Collins wrote. “This creates the separation?of?powers danger…legislative dominance over the execution of the laws.”
Last April, the North Carolina Court of Appeals upheld yet another controversial provision in SB 382, which transferred authority over the state’s Board of Elections to the state auditor’s office.
On Wednesday, Senate President Phil Berger celebrated the latest ruling on social media.
“Another victory secured! Despite Gov. Stein’s efforts to weaponize the courts to usurp the General Assembly’s authority, this ruling recognizes reality and proper constitutional order. In North Carolina, the governor is not a king,” Berger posted.
Stein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Phil Murphy signed into law Wednesday.
“My Administration has made it a priority to pursue lasting change through whole-of-government action, and today’s bill signing builds on our work to make New Jersey the best state in the nation to deliver and raise a baby,” Murphy said in a statement.
New federal law complicates state health care affordability efforts

The four new laws require:

Non-volunteer fire departments to adopt and annually review policies addressing job-related issues of pregnant employees, including limitations of duties and the use of leave time for pregnancy.
Health care professionals to conduct lead screenings on certain pregnant women, based on federal guidelines and expert recommendations.
An extension in the time parents have to enroll newborns in health benefits coverage from 60 days to 90 days.
The state Maternal and Infant Health Innovation Authority to launch a public awareness campaign on the benefits of doula and midwife services.

First lady Tammy Murphy, whose Nurture NJ initiative aims to improve outcomes for moms and babies, said the new laws will ensure “all moms and babies in New Jersey have the opportunity to thrive.” She has advocated for reducing racial disparities in mortality and urged state lawmakers and health officials to improve access to safe care for new parents.
Fire departments will have 180 days to adopt new policies, insurance extensions will take effect in March, and prenatal lead screening expansions will go into effect on April 1.
The statewide campaign on doula and midwife services will include descriptions of services provided by doulas and midwives during prenatal, birthing, and postpartum periods. It will also delve into culturally competent care, health benefits, and improved outcomes as a result of doula and midwife services, and free or low-cost resources for those services.
New Jersey is ranked 25th across the country for maternal mortality rates, according to the United Health Foundation.

South Carolina’s motto, as always, hurls us headlong with joy and optimism into the New Year.
My hope for 2026 is that state leaders address our state’s real problems this year and nudge us further toward a modern and prosperous state that works for everyone.
My hope is that state leaders grapple with the cost-of-living challenges we face, fix the rotten roads and bridges, close the teacher-shortage gap, expand health care coverage, tackle rising insurance rates, promote vaccination, avoid nuttiness (banning “chemtrails,” really?), and extend a more generous hand to our most vulnerable citizens.
And here’s another idea fit for the New Year: It’s time for us to remove the dusty statues of John C. Calhoun and Wade Hampton III from the U.S. Capitol.
Every state in the nation contributes two statues to the National Statuary Hall Collection to reflect the finest values of the people of our states.
Our two statues, Calhoun and Hampton, represent South Carolina to all Capitol visitors. They represent our state to the world. But these are two of the worst people represented by statues in the U.S. Capitol.
The stony visage of Calhoun, the fierce advocate of slavery, has scowled over the halls of the Capitol building since 1910. The statue is currently located with others in the Capitol Crypt, suitable for a dead philosophy.
Hampton, the white supremacist and slaveholder, has resided with mutton-chopped extravagance in the U.S. Capitol since 1929.
They’ve dwelled in the Capitol at public expense for too long. Time for a respectful eviction.
What brings this to mind is a recent inspiring story out of Virginia, which removed its Robert E. Lee statue from the U.S. Capitol in 2020. Just last month, Lee was replaced with a statue of teenage civil rights activist Barbara Rose Johns.
The gutsy Johns famously led a 1951 student strike against school segregation, which contributed to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Johns now stands with George Washington in the Capitol.
The statue of Lee, commander of the Confederate States Army, was moved to a Virginia museum.
The symbolism couldn’t be clearer: Virginia chose a message of aspiration and racial equality over honoring the racial strife and bloodshed of the past. The Old Dominion embraced the New South.
For South Carolinians concerned about local Confederate statues, it’s worthwhile to note that Virginia in removing Lee from the Capitol has not removed statues of Lee from across Virginia.
The Calhoun and Hampton statues also belong in museums to place them in a balanced historical context.
Statues in public places are not neutral historical records. They’re public endorsements. They represent our shared values, those we hold dear, not those we find morally abhorrent.
Calhoun and Hampton are worthy of devoted study but not worthy of public veneration.
Better angels
If Virginians can find the courage to express the better angels of their nature, South Carolinians can, too.
This idea is not too far-fetched: In 2020, Charleston City Council took the bold step of removing a statue of Calhoun from Charleston’s Marion Square.
Calhoun, who died in 1850, was perhaps the most prominent and strident defender of slavery and white supremacy in American history.
Unlike some of the founders of our nation who called slavery a “necessary evil,” Calhoun argued in an 1837 Senate speech that slavery was a “positive good” — that it was beneficial, morally justified, and the proper foundation of a stable society. He also insisted that racial hierarchy was natural and desirable.
These ideas today are loathsome to South Carolinians.
Calhoun, a powerful orator, was not just a slaveholder. He was, in many respects, the chief theorist of slaveholding and an architect of the nation’s slide toward Civil War.
Hampton, for his part, was a Confederate lieutenant general and one of the most prominent slaveholders in the Southeast.
His successful 1876 campaign for governor coincided with widespread intimidation and violence against Black voters, most notably by the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group that supported Hampton.
Historians connect the Red Shirts to the Hamburg Massacre and Ellenton Riot. Estimates of the resulting deaths range from 30 to more than 100 Black South Carolinians.
As governor (1876–1879), Hampton rolled back Reconstruction gains and paved the way for Jim Crow laws, excluding Black South Carolinians from meaningful power for generations.
But who could replace these two old Democrats, Calhoun and Hampton, in the U.S. Capitol?
That question will offer a lively future discussion among South Carolinians.
A few names I’d suggest: Robert Smalls, Ronald McNair, Ernest “Fritz” Hollings, Charles H. Townes, John Laurens and Septima Clark.
Redeeming qualities
Supporters of the status quo point out that Calhoun and Hampton, despite the gravity of their moral failings, possessed redeeming qualities.
Historians such as Merrill D. Peterson and H.W. Brands give Calhoun credit for being a brilliant if flawed thinker for developing such concepts as nullification and expressing concerns about the tyranny of the majority.
Calhoun served for decades — as congressman, senator, secretary of war, secretary of state, and vice president — and was widely regarded in his time.
Hampton, for his part, was revered by past generations of South Carolinians for his bravery, personal honor and humane treatment of civilians during the Civil War.
That said, the two were fiercely and irredeemably on the wrong side of history, defending the greatest injustices our nation has ever known. Weighed in the balance, they’re found wanting.
Calhoun and Hampton do not represent a modern, economically vibrant and increasingly diverse South Carolina that’s striving toward greater unity and harmony.

The news comes as local officials, the police department and activists in Mississippi’s largest metro area are celebrating a decline in homicides reaching pre-pandemic levels, according to multiple news outlets that track crime statistics. 
The candidates are vying to replace Joseph Wade, who retired last year after serving as chief since 2023. Mayor John Horhn named Tyree Jones, the Hinds County sheriff, to serve as interim chief. 
The city’s press release states the interviews will build on public listening sessions held over the last year by a law enforcement task force that Horhn convened. During those sessions, several Jacksonians and some police officers stated their desire to see Horhn elevate a homegrown officer currently serving in the department.
The four finalists, winnowed from a pool of 32 applicants, include just one person who fits that profile: Wendell Watts, who is currently serving as the assistant chief of patrol operations. In that role, Watts oversees criminal investigations, the department’s Crime Gun Intelligence Center and multiple interagency task forces, according to the city’s press release. 
Watts began his career at JPD in the early 1990s and returned to the department in 2023 after serving as the inaugural police chief for the city of Gluckstadt, a growing suburb north of Jackson. 
But Watts is not the only finalist with Mississippi experience. The current police chief of Columbus, Joseph Daughtry, is also a finalist for the role. The city of Jackson’s press release states that under Daughtry’s leadership, the northeastern city “experienced a full calendar year without a homicide,” an achievement that “had not occurred in more than two decades.” 
Before taking the Columbus role in 2022, Daughtry served as the Natchez police chief. 
Coming from further south, LeJon Roberts, a police major with the New Orleans Police Department, is also being considered. Roberts leads NOPD’s field operations bureau that oversees several of the city’s “most violent police districts,” according to the release. He was also tasked with “ensuring full compliance” with the city’s longrunning federal consent decree. 
“His portfolio includes command oversight of specialized units such as tactical platoons, K-9, explosives ordnance disposal, marine and search-and-rescue operations, traffic fatality investigations, and violent offender apprehension teams,” the city’s release states. 
The only woman among the finalists, RaShall Brackney served as the chief of police for Charlottesville, Va., and George Washington University in Washington, D.C., according to the city’s press release. She also spent three decades with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.
Brackney is currently a professor at George Mason University where the city’s release states her work focuses on “procedural justice, harm reduction, restorative justice, and collaborative approaches to strengthening police-community relations.” 
She is married to a Tougaloo College graduate and her in-laws live in Madison. 
Horhn and the law enforcement task force are set to interview the candidates on Thursday. City spokesperson Nic Lott said he doesn’t yet know how soon the mayor will name a new chief after the interviews.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/26160332/Chief-Joe-Wade-retires-2.jpg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

(William Woody for Colorado Newsline)Our nation has reached a critical inflection point. We can no longer ignore the alarming reality that we are using more water than the Colorado River reliably provides. Major reservoirs such as Lake Mead and Lake Powell sit at roughly one-third full and under historic stress.
Operating guidelines that manage the delivery of the River’s water — and therefore, the stability of its $3.8 trillion economy – are expiring. As our nation endures extreme levels of hydrology, droughts, and aridity — far worse than the River’s current operational framework predicted – the need for long-term solutions to this crisis has never been more urgent.
As business leaders from Arizona and Colorado, we represent hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs that rely on a stable and well-managed Colorado River. We recognize the monumental challenge of updating the rules that govern how this water is allocated and delivered to farms, businesses, and communities across seven states and Mexico.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
From a business perspective, the implications couldn’t be more acute. Water supply uncertainty threatens agriculture, manufacturing, power generation, municipal planning, and recreation economies. Investors require reliable resource baselines to commit, expand and add jobs. When the risk of systemic failure hovers, projects get deferred, jobs aren’t created, and economies falter.
We believe this is the moment to lead with innovation, collaboration and best-in-class planning to guide long-term and sustainable management of the Colorado River. Cooperation and long-term planning provide the certainty businesses depend on and lead to decisions that sustain investment and economic development for rural and urban communities alike.
The next set of guidelines will direct operations for the Colorado River after 2026. Reaching agreement on these guidelines isn’t some arcane bureaucratic exercise; it will set the foundation for sustained economic development and prosperity for millions of people, tens of thousands of businesses, and countless jobs. Our region’s economic future relies on a cooperatively managed river system that can effectively and reliably support communities and industry for decades to come.
When states and Tribal nations collaborate on long term-river management, they send a clear signal to investors and employers: the Basin’s water supplies are managed cooperatively, given its unstable hydrologic future, providing more predictability. That message matters. It matters for mountain communities and desert cities, for farmers and factories, and for recreation economies and high-tech hubs.
We’re grateful for the efforts of our state and Tribal leaders as they work toward durable solutions, and we see this moment in the river’s history as pivotal to our collective ability to prosper.
Let’s commit to a shared, pragmatic, forward-looking framework. We are all in this together.

Phil Scott enters the House of Representatives chamber to deliver his State of the State address at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, January 7, 2026. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
MONTPELIER — In his annual address to Vermont legislators Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Phil Scott urged the House and Senate to move forward with the sweeping education reform project lawmakers started last year at his administration’s urging.
But as the 2026 legislative session got underway this week, it has seemed far from certain that lawmakers will be able to overcome some key hurdles to make Scott’s plans a reality.
Speaking to a joint assembly of legislators for his State of the State address, Scott called education reform “our most critical challenge.” 
“This session, we have the opportunity and the obligation to continue this transformation in order to build the best public education system in the nation — at a cost taxpayers can afford,” he said.
The governor’s speech, which ran for about half an hour, was notable in that it focused nearly entirely on the goals of the administration’s education reform plans, centered around the 2025 law known as Act 73. Scott framed the need to evolve the state’s education system as important for preserving the public’s trust in state government.
“We don’t need to be asked to do the right thing,” he said. “We just need to do it.”
Scott also used his speech to preview, albeit briefly, that there would be “hard choices” to make when building the state’s new budget for the 2027 fiscal year, which starts in July 2026 and runs through June 2027. Lawmakers have already been expecting that some existing programs will need to be cut as support from the federal government continues to be uncertain.
“This year’s spending package has required difficult decisions,” he said of his administration’s budget proposal, which he will present in another address later this month.
This story will be updated.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Legislation that would require new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship has again been filed in advance of the Florida legislative session kicking off next week in Tallahassee.
HB 991 reportedly has the backing of the Florida supervisors of election and is sponsored by state Reps. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, R-Fort Myers, and Dana Trabulsy, R- Fort Pierce.
The bill is similar to Persons-Mulicka’s legislation from a year ago, which came in response to President Trump’s 2025 executive order requiring voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship. That bill died in committee.
The 2026 bill from Persons-Mulicka and Trabulsky include these provisions:

Requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote.
Mandates that the Florida Department of State review all current voter registrations for citizenship status and forward names to supervisors of elections to request proof of eligibility from voters. It lists documents voters can provide as proof, including a current and valid U.S. passport; a U.S. birth certificate; a Consular Report of Birth Abroad provided by the U.S. State Department; a current and valid Florida driver license or ID card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV); a naturalization certificate, a certificate of citizenship, a certificate number, or an alien registration number issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; a current and valid photo ID issued by the federal government or the government of Florida which indicates U.S. citizenship; an order from a federal court granting U.S. citizenship.
Requires driver’s licenses and state ID cards to display citizenship status.
Expands information-sharing on citizenship status between the Department of State, the DHSMV and jury coordinators.
Creates a new post-election audit process.
Makes changes to the recount process.
Makes new restrictions on campaign contributions from foreign nationals.

Another measure requiring U.S. citizenship to vote that has been introduced in the House is HB 985 by Rep. Berny Jacques, R-Pinellas County. His measure is being embraced by voter integrity advocates in Florida. Among its provisions include:

Require supervisors to verify a citizenship’s status by using the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program or “SAVE” program that is administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services used by federal, state, and local government agencies to verify the immigration status and U.S. citizenship of applicants seeking benefits or licenses.
Election supervisors “who have determined that false affirmations have been made on a voter registration application” must refer the application to the Office of Election Crimes and Security.
Information received by the DHSMV indicating that a registered voter has received a driver’s license in another state “shall be considered a written request from the voter to have his or her name removed from the statewide voter registration system.”
Narrows the list of IDs that can be used at the polls.
Adds new requirements for voters who registered using a Florida ID.
Expands the use of provisional ballots for voters whose citizenship can’t be verified.
Creates additional steps for vote-by-mail requests.
Florida IDs and driver licenses issued to non-citizens must be marked “NC” on the front.

“The future of our state and nation depends on free and secure elections!” Jacques wrote in a newsletter sent to his constituents this week. “I urge my colleagues to stand with me to safeguard our elections and support this critical piece of legislation. Thank you for your support — together, we will ensure that Florida’s elections are secure for the foreseeable future.”
Neither bill requiring U.S. citizenship to vote has a Senate companion yet.
Only four states — Arizona, Louisiana, Wyoming, and New Hampshire — require that voters provide a document proving their U.S. citizenship to register to vote,  according to VoteRiders, a nonpartisan organization.
Other election bills filed for session
Other election-related bills this year include a measure to revise the timelines for when special elections can take place. That measure has been filed in the Senate by Boca Raton Democrat Tina Polsky and in the House (HB 597) by Democrats Mike Gottlieb of Davie and Daryl Campbell of Fort Lauderdale.
Polsky is also the Senate sponsor of a proposal (SB 132) to establish a centralized database to track the voting rights of individuals with felony convictions. Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, is the main sponsor of the bill (HB 73) in the House.
Another measure would limit foreign influence in state elections, government, and public institutions. The proposal, called “The Foreign Interference Restriction and Enforcement Act” (SB 1178), is sponsored by Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach.
The proposal requires agents of foreign countries of concern (defined as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Qatar, Syria, and “the Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro”) to register with the Division of Elections and file regular disclosures. It would prohibit public officials, employees, and candidates from accepting gifts, travel, or anything of value from foreign countries of concern or designated terrorist organizations.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2506-1024x834.jpg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

(Photo courtesy of Amanda McKinney Campaign)Two years ago, Amanda McKinney, a Republican Yakima County commissioner, made a commercial endorsing Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse for re-election and assailing his GOP opponent who had the backing of then former President Donald Trump.
“I trust Dan,” she says in the 30-second television spot, adding that he has the “experience and clout to keep delivering for central Washington.”
Two weeks ago, McKinney, who is running to succeed the outgoing Newhouse, offered a different story at AmericaFest, an annual event hosted by Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
She told the crowd that after “her congressman” voted to impeach Trump in 2021, “I knew that I needed to find a way to retire him. I took a couple years … understanding and finding a pathway to retire our sitting congressman.”
Video from her Dec. 21 appearance in Phoenix, Arizona, has been mashed together with snippets from the campaign ad into a meme that’s captured the attention of Republicans in the 4th Congressional District that Newhouse has represented since 2015.
“I’ve had a lot of Republicans ask me about it,” said Matt Brown, chair of the Yakima County Republican Party and political director for the state Republican Party. “They say it doesn’t make a lot of sense. She’s been in videos with Dan for years.”
Republican Jerrod Sessler, who lost to Newhouse in 2024 and was the target of the campaign ad McKinney appeared in, was more blunt.
Jerrod Sessler is running as a Republican for a U.S. House seat in Washington’s 4th Congressional District.
“She lied. No soft shoeing it,” texted Sessler, who is also running for the congressional seat. “She lied about working to retire him because, since the impeachment, she’s been actively working to support him.”
McKinney did not respond to requests for comment.
Her ardent and longstanding support for Newhouse didn’t dissuade Trump from endorsing McKinney on Tuesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, did so too.
Trump is no fan of Newhouse. He ridiculed him as “weak and pathetic” during the 2024 election because of the impeachment vote.
The endorsements for McKinney seem aimed at nullifying Sessler, who is making his third run at the seat, and averting a slugfest among GOP candidates in the solidly Republican district. McKinney and Sessler are the only ones to announce, but state Sen. Matt Boehnke, R-Kennewick, is eyeing the race and could join in the coming days.
Sessler, of Prosser, a Navy veteran and businessman, said Tuesday that he continues to have Trump’s support.
“I knew the deal was inbound. There is no tarnish on the relationship between the president and I,” Sessler said. “His team is making deals as they have done in the past. My endorsement is from the president himself.”
One Democrat is mounting a bid for the 4th District seat so far: John Duresky, a retired Air Force officer who also worked at the Hanford nuclear cleanup site. And Devin Poore has launched a campaign as an independent. 
When Newhouse announced Dec. 17 that he would not seek a seventh term, he told reporters he had made no decisions “about who I may or may not be supporting” as a successor.

Ron DeSantis, speaking at Grace Christian School in Valrico on Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a proclamation Wednesday calling a special session in April to redistrict Florida’s congressional map, just one month after the regular legislative session is scheduled to end.
Although the call is long-awaited, coming months after DeSantis first hinted that he wanted a spring session to redraw Florida’s political lines, GOP House Speaker Danny Perez has pushed back on the governor’s plan to wait until after the regular session. And while lawmakers must abide by a governor’s special session call, they don’t have to pass any legislation.
The special session is set for April 20-24, weeks after the 2026 regular session ends on March 13.
“We are going to do it in the later part of April, partially because there’s a Supreme Court decision that’s going to affect the validity of some of these districts nationwide, including some of the districts in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said during an unrelated press conference in Steinhatchee.
“I know there’s a lot of people that are excited in both the House and the Senate to be able to do it, so they’re gonna get their chance to do it. But, realistically, you can’t do it now — the Supreme Court hasn’t ruled,” he continued. “So, we’ve got to give some time for that.”
In addition, he floated the possibility of another special session to take on property taxes. There’s “some value” in doing a session specifically dedicated to slashing the tax on homestead properties, he said.
Waiting for SCOTUS
DeSantis referred to a highly anticipated ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in a voting rights case out of Louisiana. The high court, expected to rule later this year, could bar states from taking the racial makeup of districts’ populations into account when drawing congressional lines.
Traditionally, states redistrict every 10 years following new U.S. Census data revealing the ebbs and flows of regional populations.
But the conversation surrounding the highly unusual potential for mid-decade redistricting reached a fever pitch when President Donald Trump, hoping to pad the GOP’s slim congressional majority, told Texas Republicans in July to redraw their maps.
A political cascade ensued. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, threatened to retaliate by creating more Democratic seats in his state. Democrats in Illinois, Virginia, and Maryland have discussed redrawing their congressional maps, as have GOP lawmakers in Nebraska, Kansas, and Florida.
But in Florida, fissures have begun to appear between Republican on redistricting. Although DeSantis, Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton all agree on mid-decade redistricting (DeSantis believes a SCOTUS ruling in his favor would necessitate a change in South Florida districts primarily made up of Black and Hispanic voters), they don’t all agree on the timing.
DeSantis, for his part, has emphasized the need to wait until the SCOTUS ruling to redistrict. Albritton also would like to wait.
Perez wouldn’t.
In September, he created a House redistricting committee to “explore” the process and potentially expedite the procedure in the Legislature. The Senate lacks a similar committee.
“We’re not going to wait until the spring, we’re going to move forward now,” Perez told POLITICO in December, adding that it would be “irresponsible” to wait.
This isn’t the first instance of disagreement between Perez, representing Miami, and DeSantis. The entirety of the 2025 session, a marathon 45 days longer than the 60 days initially scheduled, was marked by discord between the GOP supermajority Legislature and the executive branch.
This was largely spearheaded by Perez, who repeatedly urged his members to assert their independence from the governor. This struck a vastly different chord from DeSantis’ previous years in office, when he’d enjoyed an iron grip over a compliant Legislature as he geared up for a presidential run.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-1-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

While Mills announced that 52 bills approved by lawmakers last legislative session that were awaiting final approval will become law, she also decided to veto a proposal that sought to clarify the recent Right to Repair referendum voters approved. 
In a veto letter, Mills said she rejected LD 1228 because she believes it harms local auto repair shops and veers too far from the intent of the law passed on the 2023 ballot.
Among the bills that became law was LD 222, which establishes a voluntary, statewide takeback program for firefighting foam laden with forever chemicals. This legislation was part of a package of three bills brought forth by Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) after the August 2023 spill in Brunswick.

The bills that were given the green light to become law were held over from the previous session, which adjourned last June.

The Executive Board, a group of legislative leaders that serve as the human resources arm of Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan Legislature, filed Legislative Resolution 282 on Wednesday, officially making the motion to pursue the expulsion of State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
In a sign of how seriously lawmakers are taking the matter, which involves a formal complaint about McKeon’s behavior from at least one legislative staffer, the expulsion resolution was the first measure introduced in the 2026 session.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the Exec Board chair, noted he intends to push to suspend the Legislature’s rules requiring seven days of notice before a hearing is scheduled so the board can hold its hearing Jan. 12. Hansen said the plan is for lawmakers to debate the rules suspension motion Thursday.
The Exec Board recommended expelling McKeon following allegations that he had inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. But the board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation separate from a Nebraska State Patrol criminal investigation that led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency in September.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The criminal allegation has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon has pled not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest but changing his mind.


How the expulsion process works
To expel a member of the Nebraska Legislature, first a senator must introduce a legislative resolution presenting the motion. That resolution is then referred to a committee for a public hearing.
Per the Legislature’s rules, there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing (In McKeon’s case, the Legislature is considering suspending this rule). It’s up to the committee to determine whether the public hearing will include only invited testimony, or open it up to public comment.
Following the hearing, the committee must vote to advance the resolution to floor debate. If the resolution advances, it can be scheduled for floor debate the next day.
An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator. If successful, the motion would take effect immediately and the legislative seat would become vacant until the governor appoints a replacement.


The incident took place at an end-of-session party last spring, according to the internal investigation conducted by outside counsel Tara Paulson. The staffer claimed McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to Paulson’s report.
McKeon disputes this version of events, and has previously claimed the incident was “exaggerated and mischaracterized.”
In Paulson’s report, she noted McKeon’s perspective of the incident is that he said he hoped while the staffer was in Hawaii she got “a Hawaiian lei.” In a letter he sent to senators Monday, McKeon claimed the staffer initially said she and her husband were thinking of vacationing in Vegas, and, not being a fan of Vegas, he suggested she go to Hawaii to “get a Hawaiian lei.”
Paulson’s report concluded that McKeon’s actions did not constitute “actionable sexual harassment,” but added she thought McKeon’s actions were inappropriate and his response to the investigation did not demonstrate remorse.
“I found the senator’s demeanor during the investigation to be puzzling,” Paulson said in her report. “During my questioning, the senator responded in a joking and noticeably lackadaisical manner, a demeanor that was also observed and commented on by all witnesses interviewed.”
Hansen declined to comment on why the Exec Board unanimously voted to recommend McKeon be expelled, but said there would be more information that he expected to come out as the process continued.

The resolution lists several additional allegations against McKeon, including that he made “jokes involving the sexual function of a male in the presence of two female staffers,” during his first week in office, and used “unprofessional and inappropriate language to describe colleagues, as well as individuals of other races.”
“Senator Dan McKeon has brought the Legislature into disrespect and disrepute and has shaken the confidence of fellow members of the Legislature that the Senator from District 41 would be able to refrain from continued activity that is contrary to senatorial traditions of decorum,” the resolution reads.
McKeon, in a written response to the Exec Board, argues that the board’s assertions include “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.” He said he has not received any “reports, findings or notice” of the other allegations mentioned, so he is unable to rebut them.
McKeon said Wednesday that he intends to let the process play out to find out where the other senators land.
“A match is incomplete until the third quarter is done,” McKeon said.

(Photo by Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)In May 2025, Gov. Jared Polis signed Senate Bill 71 into law, dramatically expanding Colorado’s participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program by preventing any limitations on the number of pharmacies that can profit from the federal discount.
As a Latina health care advocate who has spent years fighting for affordable access to medications, I watched this happen with deep concern. Now, as a federal lawsuit challenging the law moves forward, Colorado patients — especially those in the state’s most vulnerable communities — are caught in the middle of a growing crisis.
Created by Congress in 1992, the 340B program requires drug manufacturers to offer significantly discounted outpatient drugs to safety-net hospitals and clinics so they can reduce prescription costs and improve services for low-income, uninsured and vulnerable populations. For communities like mine, this was supposed to be a lifeline. But more than three decades later, that promise has been broken — and the impact falls hardest on the patients who were supposed to benefit most.
Despite its good intentions, the 340B program has been turned into a source of massive, unchecked profit for large, tax-exempt hospital systems and powerful pharmacy benefit managers. This means higher costs, less transparency and limited access for Coloradans.

Since its inception, the 340B program has grown exponentially. Congressional Budget Office analysis shows that 340B spending rose from $6.6 billion in 2010 to approximately $70 billion in 2023. Over that same period, spending on brand-name drugs across the rest of the market grew 4% annually. 340B-covered entity purchases now exceed Medicaid spending on prescription drugs, which hit an estimated $51 billion in 2023.
Vertically integrated health companies, like CVS Health and other large chain pharmacy networks, are driving this furious growth. Today, more than 32,000 pharmacy locations — nearly 60% of the entire U.S. pharmacy industry — function as contract pharmacies for 340B covered entities. In Colorado, 68 hospitals and 28 federally qualified health centers participate in the program, but they contract with more than 2,500 pharmacies, including out-of-state centers.
The problem is that large hospital networks and multi-billion-dollar pharmacy chains are not passing the 340B savings directly to patients. Instead, they purchase drugs at the discounted 340B price from manufacturers and then bill patients and their insurers the full commercial price.
The New York Times reported on a woman in neighboring New Mexico whose hospital bought her cancer drugs for just $2,700 using a 340B discount, yet billed her insurer $22,700. After the insurance company paid $10,000, the patient was still charged $5,000 out-of-pocket.
A Milliman study analyzing commercial and Medicare outpatient drug spending found that 340B hospitals, on average, bill all patients nearly four times more for medicine than non-340B hospitals. The cost disparity is greater for Hispanic Medicare patients, who are billed up to five times more.
The 340B program also incentivizes hospitals to favor higher-cost drugs, as the deep discount on expensive specialty medications yields much larger profit margins than generic options. Studies confirm that 340B hospitals prescribe brand-name drugs at higher rates.
Colorado patients and employers should expect these markups, high out-of-pocket charges, and incentives for higher-cost drugs to intensify as SB-71 ensures these practices will continue and the network of profiting contract pharmacies expands.
A 2025 IQVIA study found that the 340B program caused Colorado employers to lose an estimated $152 million in rebates in 2023, equating to about $45 per beneficiary. This occurs because the program’s discounted drugs displace the rebates that commercial plans and employers typically receive, increasing overall drug spending. The same study found that SB-71 will increase costs for Colorado employers by an estimated $23 million annually due to further lost rebates.
The good news is that Congress is finally taking action. Sen. John Hickenlooper has been working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the Senate HELP Committee to investigate 340B abuses and advance bipartisan reforms. This critical work has raised national awareness and built momentum for meaningful change.
Federal reforms offer the best solution, but if the courts do not ensure more accountability for the 340B program, Colorado’s legislature must act. Any serious 340B reform effort should include transparency requirements, patient protections, reasonable limits on contract pharmacy arrangements, and accountability mechanisms.
Our collective health and shared future are at stake. The misapplication of this program inflicts harm on communities across Colorado and the country, with devastating and disproportionate consequences for the vulnerable populations it was meant to protect.
It is time to rescue this program from abuse and restore its original promise.

Pictured is art in the Iowa State Capitol that depicts the state's ties to agriculture. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said he plans to file the first Iowa Farm Act, to support farmers and rural communities in the state with tax relief, expanded economic opportunities and enhanced biosecurity.  
Naig, in an interview Wednesday with Iowa Capital Dispatch, said the bill is like a federal farm bill in that it “comprehensively brings in multiple facets” of farm and rural policy into one bill. 
“I think there’s value in having something that really cuts across and brings together the diverse, different interests of agriculture,” Naig said. “What that allows us to do, too, is to then have a platform, have a vehicle that we can talk to legislators about … a nice opportunity to create a focal point for ag and ag policy during a session.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill includes provisions for expanded economic opportunities for farmers, tax relief for farm families, support for beginning farmers and ranchers and strengthened biosecurity procedures. Naig said the policies in the bill were derived from conversations with different groups across Iowa about their priorities. 
Naig said while the Iowa Legislature moves a “tremendous amount” of ag-related policy each session, the bill comprises priorities from small groups like Iowa beekeepers and specialty crop farmers with the ag needs from livestock and row crop commodity groups. 
Naig has been Iowa secretary of agriculture since 2018 and is seeking reelection in 2026.
Economic opportunities
According to a news release from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, the bill seeks to expand economic opportunities for farmers by modernizing zoning exemptions and agritourism definitions to better support on-farm operations. Specifically, the department notes activities like value-added processing and direct-to-consumer marketing should be acceptable exemptions. The news release also said Christmas tree farms should be “explicitly” included in agritourism liability protections. 
The bill would make permanent the Choose Iowa School Purchasing Pilot Program. The pilot program helps schools to purchase locally grown and raised products, which in turn, helps farmers to have a consistent local buyer.
Specialty crop and small-sized farm operations advocated for the program to be permanently funded in the 2025 legislative session after the Trump administration ended a similar federal program. 
The measure was proposed as an amendment to the state’s budget for agriculture and natural resources, but was not accepted. The pilot program awarded 33 schools a total of $70,000 in funding in May. 
The farm act would prioritize young and beginning farmers in the state’s Choose Iowa grant programs, and “provide flexibility” to expand Choose Iowa marketing opportunities.
In addition to the Iowa Farm Act, IDALS said in a release it plans to ask for a 1.6% budget increase, about $1.3 million, to maintain “essential operations.” 
Naig said the decision to pull some of these issues out of the budget proposal and into the Iowa Farm Act gives legislators some “optionality” and puts a “focus” on the different ag policy issues the department sees.
Tax provisions 
The bill has several tax provisions, including one that expands farmer rental income tax exemptions for retired farmers to include “modern” business structures like S corporations, trusts and estates. 
It would also eliminate the grain excise tax, which is currently paid on a per-bushel basis to the local property tax system.

Naig said while the grain excise tax is technically paid by grain dealers, it “tends to get passed on to farmers in one form or another.” Eliminating the tax, he said, would help farmers and also increase government efficiency by alleviating the need for the state to collect and then redistribute the taxes to counties. 
Naig said the elimination of the credit would likely have an impact on local governments, but he said that implication would be part of broader property tax discussions planned in the Legislature. 
The legislative proposal, which is not yet filed, was supported in the news release by officials from livestock, dairy, propane and row crop commodity groups. 
Mark Mueller, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said in the release that the package “addresses the real needs facing rural communities today.” 
“We are especially encouraged by the focus on modernizing regulations, delivering tax relief and growing new markets for Iowa corn and other farm products,” Mueller said. 
The farm act would also exempt sales tax on the purchase of honey bees, bringing the industry in line with tax protocols for other livestock industries. The Iowa honey industry has asked for this change for several years. 
The bill would exempt storage tanks under 91,000 gallons from property taxes. 
Naig said some provisions of the Iowa Farm Act have low or no cost to the state, but the overall price tag for the act won’t be known until the fiscal notes are released.
The farm act also has provisions around biosecurity. Naig said these were included in response to the ongoing outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which since February 2022 has impacted more than 185 million commercial and backyard birds. 
The bill would “safeguard” producer confidentiality during foreign animal disease outbreaks in an attempt to increase early reporting. It would also authorize the state to lease space for equipment used to respond to outbreaks. 
Josh Berg, president of the Iowa Turkey Federation, applauded these sections of the proposed policy and said they are “critical” to responding to a foreign animal disease outbreaks. 
“These forward-thinking provisions will enhance Iowa’s ability to support Iowa’s family farmers during times of crisis,” Berg said.
Naig said the bill text is still being finalized, but he is “hopeful” the Iowa Farm Act will become law this legislative session. 
“We’ve been briefing and talking with (leadership) throughout the process,” Naig said. “We respect the legislative process. This is something that I can do, is to introduce a bill and introduce these concepts and then work to secure passage of that. Very hopeful that we see a large percentage of this actually make it across the finish line and signed by the governor.”

(Getty Images)Indiana could join a growing number of states scrutinizing ultra-processed foods in schools under legislation heard Wednesday that would restrict certain additives in student meals and snacks.
House Bill 1137, authored by Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, would apply to any public school that participates in a federally funded or assisted meal program. 
Beginning with the 2027-28 school year, those schools could no longer serve or sell foods or beverages containing certain additives during the school day, including in cafeterias and vending machines, nor allow third-party vendors to do so.
Some examples might include sugary cereals, chicken nuggets, chips and applesauce.
Schools would also be required to post their breakfast and lunch menus on their websites, along with ingredient lists for each item.
“This is a healthy school lunch bill,” McGuire told members of the House Education Committee. “What we serve kids at school isn’t just about lunch. It’s about their health, their ability to learn and the long-term future of our children.”
McGuire said she expects amendments to be finalized and considered next week, before the committee decides whether to advance the bill to the full House.
‘Low-hanging fruit’
McGuire framed the proposal as a response to what she called a growing childhood chronic disease crisis, pointing to rising rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease among children.
“Ultra-processed foods now make up a huge share of what kids eat every day, and for many students, school meals account for nearly half of their daily calories,” she said. “In fact, about 65% of food served through the school lunch program are considered ultra-processed.”

The bill’s current draft defines “ultra-processed” foods as those containing one or more of 13 listed ingredients, including potassium bromate, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, several synthetic food dyes, and preservatives such as BHT and TBHQ. 
Many of those additives, McGuire said, have been linked in research to cancer risks, endocrine disruption or effects on attention and brain development.
“These ingredients are inflammatory,” she said later in the hearing. “They are leading to chronic disease, and so this is kind of low-hanging fruit to try to get to start on it.”
McGuire told lawmakers she plans to amend the bill before a committee vote, however, to avoid putting a formal definition of “ultra-processed” food into state law. She said the change was prompted by concerns about conflicting standards if federal agencies later adopt a different definition from Indiana’s.
“We’re just going to keep a list of ingredients that are prohibited,” McGuire said, “so that way, we don’t have that conflict.”
Still, the bill includes several exceptions. 
Schools could still sell foods containing the listed ingredients as part of fundraising events, as long as sales occur at least 30 minutes after the end of the school day. McGuire said the carveout is meant to preserve concession stands at athletic events. Parents would also remain free to send such foods with their children during the school day.
“We can’t control what a parent sends in with a school lunch,” McGuire said. “That becomes parental choice.”
Mixed support in public testimony
Supporters argued that the bill takes a “measured” approach and gives schools ample time to comply. Changes would not take effect until the 2027-28 school year, allowing districts to renegotiate food service contracts and work with vendors.
“This bill provides districts the necessary time to review their contracts, work with vendors and make changes without any disruption to school meal service for students and their families,” said Cindy Long, executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, which supports the bill.
Long said that posting menus and ingredients online would additionally help build parent trust. 
The Indiana Small Rural Schools Association also testified in support, while urging lawmakers to consider policies that expand farm-to-school programs and local food sourcing.

Separately, Josh Trenary, with the Indiana Pork Producers Association, said his organization opposes the bill “in its current form.” He argued that focusing solely on a list of additives fails to account for why some processing occurs.
“There’s more to evaluating the value of a food product than just creating a static list of additives,” Trenary said. 
He pointed specifically to BHT, which he said is used in some pork processing to prevent fats from turning rancid. 
“If a food is nutrient dense and it’s being processed in some way to either improve safety, shelf life or nutrient availability, it shouldn’t be regulated according to this approach,” Trenary continued.
The Indiana State Poultry Association took a neutral position but echoed concerns about ensuring that high-protein foods such as eggs and turkey products are not inadvertently excluded from school menus.
McGuire maintained that alternatives to certain preservatives already exist and are being used by major retailers and restaurant chains. 
“We’re asking for producers to choose different alternatives,” she said. “This is coming down the line.”
The bill also drew questions about whether Indiana is moving faster than the federal government, which is studying ultra-processed foods and food additives.










We’re asking for producers to choose different alternatives. This is coming down the line.


– Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis


Rep. Sheila Klinker, D-Lafayette, asked whether the state should wait for more specific federal guidance.
McGuire said the delayed implementation date in her bills allows time to adjust if federal standards change.
“If, through the course of the year, something comes out about one of these particular ingredients at the federal level, we can still address that,” she said.
Officials from the Indiana Department of Health testified in support of the bill and said the agency is continuing its own review of food dyes, additives and ultra-processed foods.
“We are supportive of the transparency language and allowing parents to know what’s in their school lunches,” said Rachel Swartwood, the department’s chief of policy for health and family services. She said the measure aligns with Gov. Mike Braun’s “Make Indiana Healthy Again” initiative.
About 90% of Indiana public schools participated in the federally-funded National School Lunch Program in fiscal year 2025, according to a legislative fiscal analysis, but any financial impact on schools would depend largely on future contract terms negotiated with food service vendors.

Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.
Despite a slew of reforms enacted last year to rein in the practices of towing companies, more needs to be done to protect consumers whose cars face removal and possible sale, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday.
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera laid out five recommendations he plans to make for the legislature to consider during its session that begins in February. The recommendations follow a Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica investigation that exposed how state law for decades favored towing companies at the expense of low-income consumers. They also follow months of meetings with a group of industry and consumer representatives.
The recommendations would require towing companies to make more effort to notify owners that their cars have been towed and streamline the process by which the firms can sell unclaimed vehicles.
The commissioner announced his proposal at the last scheduled meeting of a working group of towing and consumer representatives. The group was created as part of a towing reform law passed last year after the news organizations showed how towing companies were seeking the DMV’s permission to sell some cars after as little as 15 days, one of the shortest time frames in the country. Many low-income residents were towed for minor violations, sometimes from their own apartment complexes, only to lose their cars when they couldn’t afford to get them back before they were sold.
If the legislature adopts the recommendations, towing companies would no longer place values on vehicles that they tow, which now determines whether a tower can start the sales process in 15 days or 45 days. Instead, all cars would be sold at a public auction after 30 days, Guerrera said.
Other recommendations include requiring towing companies to send two letters to the registered owner of the vehicle after it’s towed, one certified and one not. If the car isn’t claimed, towers would have to send a third letter to the owner after 30 days to inform them when and where the auction will be held. The towing companies would be required to either advertise the auction on their websites or publish legal advertisements in local newspapers.
The DMV would also be required to set up a portal on its website listing every towed car so that people can find out which tower has their vehicle, when it was towed and when the auction will be.
If a vehicle receives no bids and the car owner shows up, the towing company would be required to offer the car back to them at whatever their costs are before selling it for scrap.
There was little pushback from industry leaders or consumer advocates on Tuesday even though towing representatives had previously complained that the changes would add costs and consumer lawyers had objected that the recommendations didn’t go far enough to protect drivers.
The proposal also didn’t address the initial task the legislature assigned to the group: how to handle the profits from the sales of towed cars. Currently, towing companies are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year so owners or lenders can claim them. After that, any unclaimed funds, minus towing fees, are required to be turned over to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that hasn’t happened in part because the DMV never set up a system to collect the money.
Guerrera said after the meeting that the DMV has set up a process to monitor whether towing companies are turning funds over to the state. He said they won’t know if the system is working until October because the money from sales of towed cars must be held for a year.
After Guerrera finished outlining his proposal, Eileen Colonese, secretary of the industry group Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said Guerrera’s plan doesn’t address a key issue: The last registered owner of the vehicle is not necessarily the owner when it’s towed.
“I still believe that until the state of Connecticut comes up with a process to figure out who really owns the vehicles, all of this stuff that we’re doing is pretty much nonsensical because we’re still not notifying the current owner of the vehicle,” Colonese said.
Consumer advocate and attorney Raphael Podolsky said Guerrera’s recommendations are a “step in the right direction, but there’s still a lot of issues that need to be addressed until the system is fixed.”
Guerrera said his plan was “inspired” by the discussions during the previous four committee meetings. He said he hopes the portal on the state’s website will also help DMV personnel better track what towing companies are doing with vehicles.
Under the revised law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, towing companies must now give people warning before removing vehicles from apartment parking lots unless there’s a safety issue. They also must accept credit cards, let people retrieve their belongings and be available on weekends for people to pick up their cars. And although the sales process can begin after 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500, towers must wait 30 days before selling them.
Guerrera said he expects that the working group will keep meeting.“I want to have continuous meetings, whether it’s quarterly or twice a quarter, to try and narrow down any issues that come up or that need to be fixed so that we can create a system that works for everybody,” Guerrera said.

Microplastics littering Rhode Island's coastline increased in 2025, according to a new Save the Bay report. (Photo by Pam Gilpin for Rhode Island Current)Cigarette butts strewn across the sand and plastic bottles bobbing in the waves are the most obvious targets of frustration about litter on Rhode Island beaches.
But the button-sized plastic and foam pieces less visible to the casual observer might be a more serious problem. More than 14,000 of these 2.5-or-smaller centimeter pieces were collected from state shorelines as part of 2025 volunteer-led efforts through the International Coastal Cleanup, according to a new report from Save the Bay. 
Tiny trash came in second to cigarette butts, which claimed the dubious honor of no. 1 trash item among the 15,561 pounds of trash collected from September to November 2025. “Other plastic waste” was the third most prevalent, followed by food waste, bottle caps and plastic beverage bottles and cans.
Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

But total cigarette butts, and most types of plastic and glass bottles and cans, decreased compared with cleanup totals in 2024. Plastic and foam pieces, on the other hand, rose in quantity — a potential explanation for why the weight of total trash collected in 2025 was less than the prior year, but the total number of items was higher.
“The data reflects what we are seeing on our shores: lots of single-use items, beverage containers, and plastic and foam pieces caused by materials breaking apart over time,” July Lewis, Save The Bay’s volunteer and internship manager, said in a statement. 
And that’s just what volunteers were able to see with their own eyes.
The tiny pieces of plastic break into smaller and smaller segments, and eventually end up ingested by marine life and people, or pile up at the bottom of Narragansett Bay. A new paper published in the September 2025 Marine Pollution Bulletin by University of Rhode Island researchers found higher concentrations of microplastics in the northern part of Narragansett Bay, correlating to more densely populated urban areas. The same study also showed marshes trapped 10 to 50 times more microplastics than seabeds.
The Save the Bay report highlights ways to “stop plastic pollution at the source,” such as picking up pet waste, bringing a trash bag to the beach and encouraging friends and family to stop littering.
Bottle bill, revisited 
Not mentioned in the six-page report, but top of mind for coastal advocates: a statewide bottle-deposit refund program to incentivize recycling of plastic and glass bottles and cans. 
“The main reason Save the Bay cares about the bottle bill is because of the data you see from our coastal cleanups,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s the only real, proven, effective policy to reduce litter from bottle waste.”
Various iterations of a bottle bill have failed to advance in either chamber of the Rhode Island General assembly, despite a two-year review by an 18-member legislative panel, which was unsuccessful in finding common ground between business and environmental groups. 
On the final day of the 2025 session, lawmakers passed what some dubbed a compromise solution, calling for yet another study of the topic – this time, by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The study is due by Dec. 1, 2026, with an interim status report expected by April 1.
Does that sink bottle bill legislation this year? Not necessarily.
Rep. Carol McEntee, the South Kingstown Democrat who has championed a bottle-deposit program for years, pledged to reintroduce her proposal in 2026, even though the state-commissioned study will not be completed before the session ends in June.
“There’s no reason the Assembly couldn’t pass a bottle bill this year, even with an implementation analysis still going on,” Thorp said. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Shekarchi indicated in a Boston Globe interview in December that he wanted to wait until the study was finished before considering additional legislation.
Even if that’s the case, Thorp said having a piece of legislation to point to when educating lawmakers, retailers and the wider public is important.
“We’re not going to let a whole year go by and not do any advocacy on the bottle bill,” Thorp said. “There’s still a lot of education that needs to happen.”
Bonus: robot vacuum 
Save the Bay’s trash collection report reflects cleanups conducted from September to November 2025 by 2,971 volunteers across all five counties. Data might change when the global organizer Ocean Conservancy publishes its final report this summer.
Unusual items documented in the 2025 cleanup report in Rhode Island included a robot vacuum, a bird feeder, a nitrous oxide tank and 220 individual shoes and slippers.

An ICE officer shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. The person is dead, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.
Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approach a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. The driver then slowly backs up and appears to be leaving, when another officer fires three shots. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.
The witness who took the video, Caitlin Callenson, said she was on a walk when she saw an ICE vehicle stuck in the snow. As more ICE vehicles arrived, bystanders blew whistles in protest, and the driver of the SUV tried to block the ICE vehicles.
Callenson said she did not see ICE agents attempting to detain anyone leading up to or after the shooting.
After the shots were fired, the driver was “then was completely slumped over in the vehicle,” said Emily Heller, another witness. Federal agents wouldn’t allow a man who said he is a physician to examine the driver, Heller said. Emergency medical technicians arrived 15 minutes later, she said.
Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Secretary Dept. of Homeland Security, writing on X, gave a different version of what happened: “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”
Dozens of federal agents from ICE and the FBI, as well as Minneapolis police officers and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene
As some federal officers attempted to leave, protestors blocked their vehicle. The officers fired a noxious gas at close range, causing distress and vomiting for many demonstrators and journalists.
Protests are ongoing.
Protesters hurled insults at Minneapolis Police officers, who are not supposed to assist with immigration enforcement, but were on the scene Wednesday morning.
City Council members including Robin Wonsley and Jamal Osman addressed the crowd, saying the area was an active crime scene, and that MPD was present to investigate.
“We are trying to get MPD the f*ck out of here. That is the best way they can be helpful right now,” Wonsley told the demonstrators.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty issued a statement soon after the shooting saying she is “pushing hard for a local investigation which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”
U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a St. Paul Democrat, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who filmed herself observing ICE actions in Minneapolis on Tuesday, to immediately stop the ICE operation “to restore order and prevent further injuries.”

Southern California Edison recibió 1500 solicitudes para su programa de compensación por incendios de Eaton y sólo ha pagado 82 después de casi dos meses.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Tras poco más de dos meses, Southern California Edison ha logrado atraer a más de 1800 clientes a un programa de compensación destinado a resolver numerosas demandas contra la compañía por el mortal incendio de Eaton. Hasta el lunes, la compañía había presentado ofertas a 82 de los solicitantes, según informó Edison a CalMatters.
La portavoz de Edison, Kathleen Dunleavy, dijo que el ritmo del proceso de las aplicaciones está por delante de lo previsto.
Los sobrevivientes del incendio, que han estado brindando comentarios a Edison desde antes de que lanzara el programa de conciliación, aún tienen fuertes críticas al programa de indemnización de la empresa de servicios públicos, denominado ” Programa de Compensación para la Recuperación de Incendios Forestales “. Se quejan de que este programa exige a los participantes que renuncien a demandas contra la empresa y les impide solicitar más indemnizaciones por reclamaciones de salud relacionadas con incendios. Muchos afirmaron que los límites de pago del programa, que limitan la cantidad que pueden recibir los solicitantes, eran demasiado bajos y permitían a Edison pagar menos de lo que la compañía eléctrica podría adeudar si se le encontrara responsable del incendio.
El incendio de Eaton quemó 14,000 acres del condado de Los Ángeles en enero y causó la muerte de 19 personas. Si bien aún no se ha determinado la causa oficial, una teoría predominante es que el equipo de Edison provocó el incendio. El Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. se encuentra entre quienes han culpado a la compañía eléctrica por el incendio.
El dinero del seguro y los ahorros personales se están agotando para quienes perdieron sus hogares, su sustento y a sus seres queridos en el incendio, afirman los sobrevivientes y activistas. Muchos se encuentran sin hogar o enfrentan inseguridad habitacional. Una encuestaEditSign estimó que el 80% de los residentes de Altadena seguían desplazados por el incendio en octubre. La Red de Sobrevivientes del Incendio de Eaton , una destacada organización de base, solicitó a EdisonEditSign que proporcionara hasta $200,000 por hogar desplazado, “con base en costos verificados”, para ayudar a cubrir los costos de vivienda.
 “Es responsabilidad de Edison resolver todo esto”, dijo Joy Chen, directora ejecutiva del grupo. “Es su responsabilidad”.
 Hasta noviembre, se habían pagado aproximadamente $7.6 mil millones en reclamaciones de seguros relacionadas con el incendio de Eaton, según las cifras más recientes disponibles del Departamento de Seguros de California. Aproximadamente el 90% del pago correspondió a propiedades residenciales.
 Edison ofreció un total colectivo de 34,4 millones de dólares para resolver las 82 reclamaciones, y ninguna de las ofertas fue rechazada, afirmó.
 En una entrevista con CalMatters, Pedro Pizarro, director ejecutivo de Edison International, afirmó que aproximadamente la mitad de las reclamaciones que recibieron una oferta de Edison hasta diciembre fueron por pérdidas totales, y aproximadamente la otra mitad por daños causados por humo y cenizas. Si bien no proporcionó cifras específicas, Pizarro indicó que las reclamaciones se distribuyeron según la geografía, los niveles de ingresos y el valor de las viviendas. Muchas de las reclamaciones que recibieron ofertas forman parte de la opción de vía rápida del programa.
 En una conferencia de prensa celebrada el 16 de diciembre por la red de sobrevivientes, los residentes desplazados hablaron sobre cómo la inestabilidad habitacional y la pérdida de sus hogares han afectado sus vidas. Gabriel González, propietario de una empresa de plomería, perdió su casa, su negocio y herramientas por un valor aproximado de $80,000 en el incendio. Vivió en su auto durante un largo periodo antes de recibir una pequeña ayuda financiera que le permitió vivir en un lugar de alquiler durante unos meses. Pero se espera que ese dinero se agote este mes.
 “A partir del primero de enero probablemente volveré a estar en mi auto”, dijo en el evento.
 Pizarro informó a CalMatters que Edison no proporcionará fondos a los residentes para vivienda fuera de su programa de compensación, alegando la necesidad de validar los gastos. La solicitud de la red de sobrevivientes para asistencia con los costos de vivienda se limitó a los costos verificables.
 Una crítica al programa fue que los niños no reciben la misma compensación que los adultos. Bajo la versión actual del programa, los niños reciben entre el 50% y el 65% de la compensación que reciben los adultos por la pérdida de su residencia, dependiendo de la categoría del daño. Si su vivienda principal fuera destruida, los adultos recibirían $115,000 y los niños $75,000. Estas tarifas son ligeramente superiores a las de una versión preliminar del plan que Edison publicó en otoño.
 Una carta abierta de la Red de Sobrevivientes del Incendio de Eaton en ese momento decía que dar a los niños una valoración inferior a la de los adultos “trata su sufrimiento como menor cuando, en realidad, es mayor”.
 Pizarro dijo que Edison optó por una valoración más baja porque los niños a menudo no reciben tanto como los adultos en programas similares y los adultos “terminan asumiendo más responsabilidad y más costos” para el hogar y los “arreglos para los niños”.
 “La realidad es que los adultos tienen una carga mucho mayor aquí”, dijo, “y por eso es justo que tengamos más compensación dirigida a los adultos”.
 Otra frustración expresada por los afectados por el incendio fue la exigencia de que los participantes renunciaran a su derecho a demandar a la empresa. Los representantes legales de los sobrevivientes del incendio que demandaron a la empresa advirtieron que el programa de conciliación a través de Edison podría privar a las personas de cualquier indemnización por daños y perjuicios que un tribunal pudiera otorgar, así como de una posible compensación o supervisión médica a largo plazo.
 “Estamos abordando esto como una forma de resolver litigios”, dijo Pizarro. “Es una forma de acuerdo legal, y los acuerdos legales suelen ser acuerdos que resuelven todos los asuntos; de lo contrario, no constituyen realmente una conclusión del litigio”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 13:59:27.635951

Sears/Maryland Matters)State officials are decrying new federal jobs numbers that show Maryland lost more than 10,000 federal jobs over two months at the end of last year, bringing the total jobs lost for the year to 25,000.
The report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that Maryland lost more federal jobs since President Donald Trump took office than any other state in the nation. In sharp remarks Wednesday directed at the Republican administration in Washington, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said  Washington has “broken its pact” with Maryland and with the country.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Donald Trump ran on a premise that he alone could fix it,” Moore said during the Board of Public Works meeting Wednesday. “What he didn’t tell the American people was that he alone could break it, and the policies that we continue to see from this White House have continued to make all of our lives harder.”
The updated figures reflect job loses from October and November, when the so-called “fork in the road” job buyout took effect, for federal employees who had the opportunity to resign and receive full pay and benefits until the end of September. State officials said it would be not be until after the deadline when the impact of those decisions would start to be seen.
Federal jobs represent about 6% of the state’s total employment and 10% of the state’s overall wages.
“As I said, months into the new Trump Vance administration, what is happening to the state of Maryland that these are not lancing blows. These are direct shots. They are direct shots that are impacting every single corner of our stat,” Moore said.
The numbers released Wednesday do not come as a surprise. The Board of Revenue Estimates last March projected a reduction of as many as 28,000 federal jobs in the state.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tom Loftus)FRANKFORT — The cost to expand the headquarters of the Republican Party of Kentucky rose above  $4.4 million in the final quarter of 2025 as the project was completed, according to a report filed this week with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance.
But more large contributions from special interests during the same period allowed the fund to remain easily in balance. The two largest contributions to the fund during the period were $150,000 from tobacco giant Altria Client Services, of Richmond, Virginia,and $50,000 from The Jockey Club, of New York City, according to the new filing by the Republican Party of Kentucky (RPK) Building Fund .
Both Altria and The Jockey Club had made previous contributions to the fund.
Three years ago Kentucky Lantern first reported that the RPK had begun planning and fundraising for the expansion of its headquarters on Third Street in Frankfort and that the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had donated a stunning $1 million to the effort.

Over the three years a small number of donors — nearly all corporations or other entities with lobbying interests in Washington and/or Frankfort — have made very large contributions totaling more than $4.4 million to pay for the new structure.
The RPK headquarters is named the “Mitch McConnell Building” in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with propelling the ascent of the Republican Party to dominance in the state over the last 40 years. McConnell, the longest-serving U.S. Senate leader in history, led Senate Republicans from 2007 until 2025. He announced last year on his 83rd birthday that he would not seek reelection this year, setting off a crowded race to succeed him.
As for the contributions, Adam Hope, spokesman for the RPK, said, “All funding raised for our expansion was done by the book. Contributions to our building fund are a reflection of the strength of our party and the enthusiasm of our supporters, in Kentucky and beyond, who believe in the progress Republicans are making for the betterment of the Commonwealth.”
The project was made possible by a 2017 law passed by the General Assembly in 2017, the first year that Republicans controlled both chambers of the legislature. Before then, corporations were not allowed to contribute to a state political party, and people were restricted to giving no more than $15,000 a year. But the 2017 law allowed parties to create building funds that could accept contributions from corporations or people in unlimited amounts.
The report filed this week by the RPK Building Fund listed $580,000 in expenses during the last three months of 2025. That brought total spending on the project to a bit over $4.4 million.

By far the largest share of spending — about $3.8 million — was paid to contractor Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs. Stengel-Hill Architects, of Louisville, has been paid about $263,000 through 2025, according to the reports. And the third highest expense has been $195,000 paid to Haney Consulting, the political fundraising business run by Laura Haney, a longtime fundraiser for McConnell as well as other Kentucky Republican causes.
The Kentucky Democratic Party reported one major deposit during the last quarter to its building fund of $499,241. This is apparently most of the proceeds from the sale last fall of its old headquarters on Interstate 64. The Kentucky Lantern reported last month that property records filed in Franklin County show that the party sold the old headquarters property for $540,000 and is now headquartered in offices on Ann Street in Frankfort. 
Morgan Eaves, executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party, said, “Our focus has not been on a big new building but on policy – policy that will help Kentuckians who are losing health care and other basic needs because of things like the Republican Big Beautiful Bill.”

Last year, lawmakers revised the process for challenging ballot language and, in the same legislation, gave the attorney general power to appeal preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement of state laws or regulations.
Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green upheld the provisions on ballot language lawsuits but ruled the new appeals power was an impermissible grant of authority because it was limited to the attorney general.
“There is no compelling governmental interest achieved in allowing only the attorney general to appeal a preliminary injunction where a court has found that a challenged state law is flawed and granted injunctive relief,” Green wrote in his September decision.
In the appeal heard Wednesday, the attorney general’s office sought to undermine the case against the law by arguing that the plaintiff, liberal activist Sean Nicholson, had no standing, or right to sue, over the law. And, Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Freedlund argued, the court  should rule that all the provisions of the law fit easily under the general heading of “judicial proceedings.”
Chiefs in, Royals out: Missouri secretary of state once again catches flak over ballot summary

When the bill was filed in the state Senate, its title said it was about ballot titles written by the General Assembly. The title was changed to be the broader “judicial proceedings” when the bill was amended on the Senate floor.
“The original bill, as introduced, effected judicial proceedings related specifically to ballot title litigation, but this court has made clear, time and time again, that it’s whether the amendments are germane to the overarching purpose,” Freedlund said.
Those arguments ignore constitutional provisions requiring bills to have a single subject, with a clear title, and that everything included in a final version bear a relationship to the subject addressed when the bill was introduced, said Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing Nicholson.
The legislation, as passed, combined two bills with different subjects and changed provisions of law in two of overarching titles used to organize the statutes, Hatfield noted.
“We think that all of those things point out that the legislature has told us that these were different subjects, these were different purposes,” Hatfield said.
To address the constitutional questions, however, the judges must first resolve whether Nicholson has standing.
Hatfield reminded the court that it has liberally applied the principle of standing in past challenges to state law. 
A person has a right to sue if they are specifically impacted by a new law. The courts also allow any taxpayer to sue if legislation will result in the spending of state funds.
Nicholson satisfies both requirements, Hatfield said. He is a campaign consultant working on ballot measures, so he has a specific interest in how ballot language is determined, he said.
And taxpayer standing doesn’t depend on an identifiable new expense, just that enforcement will cost money, he said.
“You don’t have to show it is tied to a very specific, ‘this amount of money is going to go out the door for this particular thing’,” Hatfield told the judges.
Freedlund, however, said Nicholson was not the correct plaintiff because he is not involved in any pending cases on ballot language and there is no new, direct expense as a result of the law.
“Taxpayer standing requires some sort of direct expenditure,” he argued.
The law is part of a coordinated Republican reaction to liberal ballot initiatives approved by voters enacting laws and constitutional amendments the GOP would not pass through the legislature.
Over the past decade, voters have legalized marijuana, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased the minimum wage and enacted protections for abortion rights over GOP opposition.
Other legislation to limit the initiative petition process includes a constitutional amendment to change the way majorities are counted that will be on the November ballot and limitations on who can be hired to circulate petitions.
Ballot title challenges are common for both initiative petitions and measures approved for the ballot by lawmakers. Before the new law, if a judge found the ballot language was insufficient or unfairly partisan, the court would revise it.
Under the law, a finding against ballot language means it goes to the secretary of state, who is given up to three chances to rewrite it before the courts take over the job. 
The bill’s provisions governing the revision of ballot language are a reaction to the legal fight over the wording for the abortion rights amendment approved by voters in 2024.
In 2023, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the ballot title written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft was “argumentative” or unfairly biased and rewrote it. That decision was upheld by the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals.
The first use of the new law was during a challenge to the ballot language written for a constitutional amendment passed by lawmakers that would reimpose Missouri’s near-total ban on abortions. Green rejected the original ballot language written by lawmakers. He approved the second revision made by Hoskins, but that version was rewritten again by the Western District Court of Appeals when it ruled the wording drafted by Hoskins was riddled with errors.
The abortion rights amendment from 2024 was also the spur to lawmakers for the language granting special appeal power to the attorney general. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state over laws and regulations that prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the election. 
Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law and, in two preliminary injunctions, blocked state laws requiring a 72-hour waiting period for abortions, requiring physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and requiring a licensing requirement for abortion clinics. 
That allowed surgical abortions to resume but medication abortions, the most common way of ending a pregnancy, are still off-limits.
The case goes to trial next week.
In court on Wednesday, Freedlund defended the grant of power to the attorney general as a reasonable way for the state to protect its interest in seeing that new laws are enforced. 
Green’s ruling incorrectly interpreted how to determine if a law provides equal protections to all people when he ruled against the law, Freedlund said.  
“It’s critical that the circuit court erred at every single step of the analysis, in our view, and any one of those errors was fatal to the trial court’s judgment,” he said.
In his arguments about the powers of the attorney general, Hatfield focused on whether the entire bill should have been tossed out by Green when he found the provision on preliminary injunctions to be unconstitutional.
Instead, Hatfield said, Green severed the bill, allowing the ballot title sections to remain intact while blocking the appeal power section.
Green got that wrong, he said, adding that it will be up to the judges to decide which, if any, provisions remain in law.
“So at the end of the day, like a lot of your cases,” Hatfield said, “this is sort of about line drawing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240404_122730-scaled-e1712257678774-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-07 13:59:27.635951

Join us next week for a preview of the 2026 Iowa legislative session.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislators will pursue a statewide school cell phone ban, superseding the state education board’s past directives to allow local districts to deal with cell phones as they see fit.
The initiative already has the support of two-thirds of the Senate, according to a joint announcement from Sens. Chase Blasi, an Andale Republican, and Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat.
If passed into law, Senate Bill 302 would require each local school board and nonpublic school’s governing authority to create policies dictating student cell phone use during instructional time by Sept. 1.
The bill establishes a bell-to-bell mandate, requiring students to power off and store any personal electronic communication devices, and it forces districts to create disciplinary actions and enforcement procedures for any violations. It also allows districts to limit or prohibit cell phone usage during school-sponsored activities that take place outside of normal school hours.
The bill will be a “high priority,” the Tuesday announcement said. It was filed less than a week before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
“Phone-free schools give students space to think, build authentic human relationships and protect student mental health from constant digital pressure,” Blasi said. “The longer phones stay in classrooms, the harder it becomes to undo the damage.”
If the legislation becomes law, it would override local boards’ existing policies if incongruous with the state’s mandates. It also could bolster the Kansas State Board of Education’s previous guidance.
The board unanimously approved a list of recommendations in December 2024 that encouraged districts to adopt bell-to-bell policies that mandate K-12 students’ personal cell phones be powered off from the beginning of the school day to the end, including during lunch and passing periods, and stored in an off-limits location. The recommendations highlighted a need for greater mental health support and parental oversight.
A student can use a device if it is necessary for an education or specialized instruction program or if a doctor deems it medically necessary to support a student’s health and well-being. Students are allowed to contact their parents or guardians through a school telephone, according to the bill’s text.
Sykes said the legislation helps strengthen Kansas schools and teachers.
“Studies show that classrooms without phones have more engaged students leading to face-to-face conversations, stronger peer relationships, safer school environments and better academic outcomes,” she said.
Teachers are not prohibited from using personal communication devices at school, but the bill does require new policies banning school employees “from privately or directly communicating with any student via a social media platform for official school purposes.” A school board or nonpublic school authority can approve a social media platform to be used for official school purposes, the bill said. Private, direct communications are not encompassed in “official school purposes.”
Carrie Rahfaldt, a spokesperson for House Speaker Dan Hawkins, said he is supportive of the legislation. Denise Kahler, a spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Education, said the state school board had yet to take a position on the proposed ban.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132328-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 13:12:19.120632

(National Weather Service photo, courtesy of Candyse Arivett)Gov. Larry Rhoden has asked the federal government to help pay for more than $1.7 million in damage to public property in South Dakota caused by a storm last month.
Wind gusts of 100 miles an hour or more tore through large swaths of western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming Dec. 17-18, causing what a press release from Rhoden’s office called “severe infrastructure damage.” 
Pennington, Custer and Fall River counties were among the most affected, the release says. The National Weather Service logged the highest wind gusts in recorded history at the agency’s monitoring sites in eastern Rapid City and the Rapid City airport during the storm, at 91 and 94 miles per hour, respectively. The top wind gust recorded by the agency during the storm was 101 miles per hour at a location 4 miles south of downtown Rapid City.
Some residents in the Black Hills experienced power outages that lasted a week, according to the weather service.
Rhoden’s disaster declaration, signed on Wednesday, opens the door to possible assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
If FEMA approves the declaration, it could pick up as much as 75% of the price of repairs to public property. Counties would pay 15% of repair costs; the state would pay 10%. 
To qualify for federal aid, an incident must cause at least $1.7 million in damage to public property. The December storm’s damage tally thus far “exceeds that amount,” Rhoden’s press release says.

(Photo by Getty Images)Lawmakers are considering a proposal that could help Maine renters lower electricity costs through the use of solar energy.
State Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) said LD 1730 would allow for small, plug-in solar units so renters and other Mainers can access the renewable energy source without the large upfront investment of traditional panels and without adding costs to the state or other ratepayers. 
“For many of my neighbors, especially those who rent their homes or live in apartments, solar panels seem meant for someone else,” Grohoski said. “If you don’t own your roof or you don’t have thousands of dollars for an upfront investment, the savings that solar generates can feel out of reach.”
When introducing the bill to the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee during a public hearing Tuesday afternoon, she said these sorts of units cost less to install than traditional roof panels and don’t require any permanent modifications to the property.
Lawmakers in Vermont and New Hampshire are also looking into welcoming these systems, which have already taken off in Europe. More than a million such units have been deployed in Germany.
Grohoski said the portable solar devices would not be included in the state’s net energy billing program because they don’t contribute power back to the grid. Though, the proposal does include a notification process so utilities can know where the units are located for load planning purposes.
Net energy billing, a credit program developed to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy, has been scrutinized in recent years for contributing to rising energy costs, though state officials say the volatility of natural gas prices is a more significant driver. 
The state Department of Energy Resources testified in favor of Grohoski’s proposal Tuesday. Public Advocate Heather Sanborn described these devices as “another tool for affordability” that should be brought into the mix for Maine ratepayers.
“This is not a solution to affordability writ large,” Sanborn said. “This is just another tool in our toolbelt to allow for an all-of-the-above approach to affordability.”
This focus on costs comes as Central Maine Power and Versant customers are slated to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
Last month, utility regulators redesigned and expanded eligibility for a program that helps low-income Mainers pay their electric bills. 
Versant Power is opposed to the plug-in solar proposal. The utility said such technology necessitates more robust safety certifications and requirements from the National Electrical Code, which sets the country’s standards for electrical design and installation. However, Versant said it supports customers being able to utilize that sort of technology.
Grohoski’s proposal outlines multiple safety standards. For example, it would include provisions to protect utility line workers and require systems to limit combined output to ensure they don’t overload standard household units.
The bill would also require new buildings with four or more units to provide outdoor outlets so future renters could utilize small solar devices more easily. 
“It’s about giving a person on a third floor apartment the same power to lower their electricity bill as a homeowner who has a south-facing roof,” Grohoski told the committee.
Given the relatively small amount of electricity these devices typically use — it was compared to an air conditioner or a hair dryer (depending on exact size of the unit) by experts during the public hearing — some committee members raised questions as to why this legislation is even needed. 
Versant said it appreciated the notification process outlined in the bill and argued the legislation is necessary since it would exempt these solar devices from the interconnection process and standards.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2169269955-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 12:59:04.558689

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A former University of Iowa Hospitals physician is appealing a court decision tied to an Iowa Board of Medicine investigation into his conduct.
In 2021, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Shafik N. Wassef, 42, an Iowa-licensed physician who formerly practiced in Iowa City, with violating patient privacy standards.
A year later, in March 2022, the board amended and expanded its statement of charges in the case, charging Wassef with the added offenses of professional incompetence, practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, and unprofessional conduct.

The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges.
In 2024, the board agreed to hand the case off to an administrative law judge. Wassef then sought summary judgment in the matter, which would have resulted in dismissal of the charges before the planned disciplinary hearing could be held.
The administrative law judge denied the request for summary judgment, which prompted Wassef to file a petition in Polk County District Court, seeking judicial review of that decision.
Polk County District Judge David Nelmark then ordered that all court records that “describe the (board’s) investigation and/or the factual basis of the disciplinary charges” against Wassef be sealed from public view.
In a recent ruling, Nelmark granted the state’s request to dismiss Wassef’s lawsuit.
In doing so, Nelmark noted that while he would “not go into the alleged wrongdoing” in the case, the board’s allegations against Wassef “involve HIPAA violations” — a reference to the federal Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, which protects patient records from unwarranted disclosure.
In his lawsuit, Wassef argued the Board of Medicine violated its own rules when it did not identify any evidence to support the disciplinary charges against him when arguing that administrative law judge should deny Wassef’s request that the disciplinary matter be dismissed through summary judgment.
In his decision, Nelmark wrote that it’s clear the board has identified for Wassef the names of the individuals involved in the patient-privacy matter, and the time period in which the alleged violations occurred.
“It is not clear to the court what additional evidence Dr. Wassef was seeking from the board that he did not receive,” Nelmark wrote in his decision. “Dr. Wassef asserts that his actions did not constitute HIPAA violations and that the investigation into his conduct was flawed, but it does not appear that he is unclear as to what the board alleges he did.”
Wassef has appealed Nelmark’s ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court.
Court records indicate Wassef is currently a resident of Florida, where he has an active medical license. In his petition, Wassef argues his Florida license will be adversely affected by the pending disciplinary charges if the case is permitted to proceed to a full disciplinary hearing.
Separately, Wassef is currently suing the University of Iowa Hospitals, alleging that in June 2018, just before his graduation from the UIHC residency program, he was contacted by the hospital’s compliance office and informed he had committed multiple HIPAA violations.
The hospital, Wassef alleges, then filed a complaint against him with the state licensing board and contacted the alleged patient “victims” in the matter to inform them of the situation and invite them to make formal complaints with the board.
The lawsuit, filed in December 2023, alleges the hospital’s allegations are false and have caused “catastrophic professional damage in his field that is ongoing to this day.”
The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. A trial in the case is scheduled for Oct. 13, 2026.

A Wednesday court filing from Commonwealth’s Attorney Miranda King says that the state’s fetal homicide law precludes using it in this case. The statute says “nothing in this chapter shall apply to any acts of a pregnant woman that caused the death of her unborn child.”
The state law “unambiguously exempts the defendant, the infant’s mother,” the filing states. “The Commonwealth has no grounds to pursue prosecution of Count One based on the legislature’s clear decision to exempt and protect the defendant mother’s actions in this matter.”

Kentucky State Police charged the woman, Melinda S. Spencer, 35, with fetal homicide as well as abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence. The latter are both Class D felonies. It’s unclear how far along her pregnancy was. She was indicted Tuesday and set to be arraigned Wednesday. 
King, the prosecutor, said in a statement that she “sought this job with the intention of being a pro-life prosecutor” but must and will follow the law, according to media outlets.

The drastic work project cuts made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bolin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, were accomplished through an unconstitutional process that violated the separation of powers clause and other requirements in the Michigan Constitution, Attorney General Dana Nessel said Wednesday.
The determination came after reports of internal pressure for Michigan House Republicans who have tried to backtrack on the cuts that have affected a number of community services and projects that their constituents counted on.
Nessel was asked to give a formal opinion on the cuts in a request from state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing). The attorney general wrote in response that the disapproval mechanism used by Bollin (R-Brighton Township) unconstitutionally allowed one legislative committee to unilaterally terminate funding previously appropriated by the full Legislature and the governor.
In her opinion, Nessel concluded “that this disapproval mechanism violates both the Separation of Powers and Bicameralism and Presentment requirements in the Michigan Constitution.”
The separation of powers requirement limits the ability of one branch of government to exercise the functions of another; the presentment and bicameralism requirements reflect the constitutional mandate that laws must be debated and passed by both houses of the Legislature and presented to and signed by the governor.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

Bollin said in a statement that she believed Nessel was wrong on both the law and the facts, and that her opinion in the matter felt more like “a political defense of Democrats’ pet projects than an objective legal analysis.”
“The House Appropriations Committee acted fully within its legal authority under a law that has been on the books for decades — a statute enacted in the 1980s that clearly allows the Legislature to disapprove work projects that do not meet the standards required by law,” Bollin wrote. “Nothing about that authority is new, and nothing about our action was unconstitutional. What is new is Democrats’ frustration that the days of unchecked slush funds and blank checks are coming to an end.”
Nessel, however, said the disapproval mechanism violated the separation of powers clause because it allowed a single legislative committee “exert control over the executive’s implementation of enacted laws.”
The bicameralism and presentment requirements were violated because “the committee veto doesn’t comply with the constitutional requirement that legislative action be approved by both legislative chambers and presented to the governor, except in only certain narrow and explicit circumstances expressly identified within the Constitution itself.”
“By empowering a single legislative committee to negate the State Budget Director’s work-project designations, the statute reserves the very administrative control that the separation of powers forbids,” Nessel wrote in the opinion. “This disapproval mechanism effectively creates a ‘legislative veto’— or, more accurately, a ‘legislative committee veto.’ This comprises an unconstitutional reservation of administrative control that interferes with the executive branch’s core function of executing the laws. Under Article III, Section 2, when an appropriation is enacted, the Legislature’s role ends, and the executive branch’s duty to faithfully execute the law begins.”
Democrats praise decision
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), Anthony and House Minority Floor Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) each applauded Nessel’s opinion.
“Not only was the House Republicans’ choice to steal money from the people of Michigan heinous, it was also unconstitutional,” Brinks said in a statement. “There’s no surprise here — when they can’t win in the Capitol, they try to bend the rules or break the law, hoping no one notices. But this time, people noticed. Pregnant and new moms who were counting on financial support noticed. Folks trying to combat the opioid epidemic noticed. And advocates for child abuse victims and those who help feed Michigan’s seniors noticed.”
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Brinks added that she hopes the thousands of people who reached out in distress over the past month “can breathe a little easier, knowing that this will not stand.”
“This group of Republican legislators is unscrupulous, and everyone should demand better,” Brinks said.
Anthony said the opinion was “a lifeline for the countless non-profit organizations and local governments that have been left in limbo for weeks.”
“I’m talking about county land banks forced to halt affordable housing projects, community centers unable to answer questions from parents about whether their child’s Head Start program will be open this week, and school districts scrambling to make their balance sheet whole — all because House Republicans made a unilateral decision about who is and isn’t worthy of receiving contractually agreed upon state funding,” Anthony said in a statement.
Puri said the cuts amounted to cruelty aimed at some of the House GOP’s own constituents.
“From the moment House Republicans weaponized this rare provision to unilaterally, and without discussion, cut $645 million in appropriated funding for kids with cancer, sexual assault survivors, firefighters and police, and thousands of other cities, non-profits and Michiganders, House and Senate Democrats began fighting back,” Puri said in statement. “The uncertainty and chaos that these attempted cuts caused, not to mention the cruelty in slashing programs for vulnerable moms and babies, veterans and more, was both unprecedented and completely unwarranted.”
Blowback from GOP decision
The cuts are causing problems within the House GOP caucus, Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based legislative news and intelligence service, reported Monday, noting that House Republicans in vulnerable districts were submitting requests to restore funding for work projects in their own communities — even after their leadership praised the cuts as a way to cut “waste, fraud and abuse,” a mantra the House majority repeated throughout the 2025-26 budget process.
Gongwer reported that Republican state Rep. Ron Robinson of Utica, who voted against the cuts, still called them “well-intentioned.”
State Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson) was also a House GOP member facing a tough election fight, and has told her constituents in a news release that the money had been simply paused. As Gongwer noted, the money was not paused, it was canned by House leadership.
In another odd twist, State Rep. Jim DeSana (R-Carleton) was among the members who voted for the cuts — which ultimately slashed nearly $2 million in state funding going to repair the roof of a building named after his father, The Detroit News reported.
Bollin went on the defend her committee’s actions, noting that Nessel “has never voted on a budget, never analyzed a state budget, and now appears perfectly comfortable defending a system where hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars were shuffled through vague work projects with little oversight and no accountability.”
“That is not how responsible government works, and it is not what Michigan taxpayers expect,” Bollin said. “It’s also worth remembering that Attorney General Nessel herself was hiding all of her department’s operations under a single line item until House Republicans stepped in this year to demand transparency and add accountability to her spending. That experience makes this opinion especially hard to take seriously.”
Bollin remained adamant that the Legislature had both the authority and the responsibility to oversee the spending of taxpayer dollars.
“We exercised that responsibility lawfully and in the best interest of the people of Michigan,” Bollin said. “Political opinions from the Attorney General’s office will not change that reality, nor will they deter House Republicans from continuing to restore accountability to state government.”

No pressure, Mississippi, but the Southeastern Conference hasn’t gone three years without a football national championship since the turn of the century.
Big Ten teams won the last two national titles — 2023 Michigan and 2024 Ohio State — and with No. 1 Indiana matched against No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl on Friday, the conference is assured of being represented in the championship game again.
The last SEC team to play for it all was Georgia, which hammered TCU 65-7 in 2022 for its second straight title and the conference’s fourth in a row.
The “It Just Means More” conference hasn’t gone three years without a title since a four-year stretch from 1999-2002.
LSU won the Bowl Championship Series title game in 2003 but shared the title with Southern California. From 2006-22, the SEC won 13 of 17 championships and had at least one team in the title game all but one year.
The picks, with seedings and lines from BetMGM Sportsbook:
No. 6 Mississippi (plus 3 1/2) vs. No. 10 Miami
The Rebels (13-1) are as much a feel-good story as Indiana, maybe even more. The plot: Coach (Lane Kiffin) ditches team for a job with a conference rival (LSU), new coach (Pete Golding) opens his tenure with two playoff victories and several assistants stay on while moonlighting at LSU during the playoff run. Oh, and the star of the team (QB Trinidad Chambliss) is a transfer from Division II Ferris State. All this has galvanized the Rebels.
Against Miami, the challenge will be keeping Chambliss upright. The Hurricanes (12-2) have a combined 12 sacks in playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State, and lead the nation with 46. The Rebels have kept Chambliss mostly clean, allowing just one sack in three games since Florida got to him five times on Nov. 15.

Miami QB Carson Beck has shaken off his interception issue with offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson’s emphasis on spreading around short passes. Beck has thrown just one interception in the last six games; he was picked off nine times in the first eight.
Pick: Mississippi 28-27
No. 1 Indiana (minus 3 1/2) vs. No. 5 Oregon
The Hoosiers and Ducks were dominant in the quarterfinals and now they square off for the second time this season. Indiana (14-0) handed Oregon (13-1) its only loss, 30-20 in Eugene on Oct. 11. The winner of the rematch will play for its school’s first national championship in football.

Much attention is paid to Indiana’s offense with Fernando Mendoza leading the way. He is going to have to be sharp against an Oregon defense that has improved its pass coverage since the first meeting. The Ducks flummoxed Behren Morton in the 23-0 quarterfinal win over Texas Tech.
This game will be close, and the Hoosiers have the more consistent defense. Remember, James Madison found a way to move the ball against Oregon in the first round, and the Hoosiers have the Heisman Trophy winner in Mendoza.

And that’s where Brian Miller comes in.
A Helena-based attorney and student of the Federalist Papers, he, like some politicians, believes that America has strayed from its high-minded ideals.
And, the Democrat will try to unseat Republican incumbent Congressman Troy Downing, said that those in the center and left must reclaim the wisdom and vision of the nation’s founders because many of their ideas, especially about the separation of powers and limitations of government, can be a guide to escape the current cycle of political gridlock.
Miller told the Daily Montanan before the holidays “revolutionary” approaches are needed to overcome the challenges of housing, healthcare and the economy — and by revolutionary, he means a return to the some of the principles of the founders.
As for leaders like President Donald Trump, Miller said history has already spoken.
“He is using what (the founders) called ‘tyrannical use of power,’” Miller said. “He’s doing what the founding fathers said a tyrant does.”
 

  About Brian Miller 

Born: 1972 (Cleveland, Ohio)
Education: Bachelor’s degree, Emory University; Juris Doctorate, University of Montana
Status: Divorced, two children (Sage and Owen)
Website: https://www.miller4congress.com/



Miller jumped into the race because of his two children, Sage and Owen, and his love for the country and state.
“What I want people to think about is: What are we doing and where are we going?” he asked.
Although he’s running as a Democrat, Miller doesn’t describe himself as necessarily partisan. He said he’s more worried about the growing economic divide and the mountain of debt the country is accumulating— something he said will take a bipartisan effort to correct.
“If we don’t fix it, it will be destructive and hugely catastrophic,” Miller said.
He also said that it’s time to “decelerate” wealth accumulation, pointing out that the top 10% of Americans have two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
“You want to talk about affordability? There it is,” Miller said. “There is an insane concentration of wealth and money all going to a few people. We do not want socialism, but this is way out of whack. There is an unhealthy concentration of wealth and it will end up killing the economy.”
He plans to focus his year campaigning on making things like housing, childcare and healthcare more affordable. Miller advocates for more equity in taxing, especially when it comes to individual versus corporate taxation. He says the difference is fundamental and would require a shift away from the demands of short-term money to longer term growth.
Miller opposes Trump and the Republicans’ approach to tariffs, saying it’s among the most regressive form of taxation.
“Billionaires don’t care if a car is an extra $10,000,” Miller said. “You only notice when you’re making less than $50,000.”
Congressional candidate Brian Miller.
He said American businesses, regardless of politics, are paralyzed by the uncertainty that presidential politics has played. Miller said nowhere is that more obvious than in the agricultural sector. He pointed to examples of trade deals collapsing for soybeans and sky-rocketing input prices for feed and fertilizer.
“It’s unfair to blame the affordability crisis on Trump, but everything he’s done is making it worse,” Miller said.
He said the structural issues of increasing home prices, stagnant wages and housing shortages have been perennial problems, but Miller said Trump should be judged by what he said he could do.
“And he said he was the guy who would fix it all,” Miller said.
  Health insurance 

Miller also sees obvious solutions in American healthcare, beginning with the cost per capita and the health outcomes. He looks at Germany and sees Americans paying nearly double what it spends. While Germany spends around $300 yearly on administrative costs, America’s average is about triple.
“I am not saying a single-payer solution is the answer, but there’s a broad consensus that the problem is insurance companies,” he said.
He said government’s role in healthcare has yielded a positive benefit from providing more healthcare via Medicaid expansion to guaranteeing a market to businesses who found a cure for COVID by offering to buy the product. He said COVID and the vaccination, often maligned by some conservatives, shows perfectly how the government can be involved in helping to create solutions.
  Mounting debt 

Miller said despite conservative politicians talking about the debt, neither political party has done a lot to stop it recently. He worries the window of time to solve the looming financial crisis is closing.
He said that runs a close parallel to what the British colonists in America saw, which led to the Revolutionary War: A mother country which kept on pushing the colonies to the brink of financial collapse.
“Hamilton referred to the British as ‘economic enslavers,’” Miller said.
He said those feelings of being trapped with few ways out don’t so much resonate with older voters, but he’s said they’ve been embraced by younger voters.
“These conditions have become too extreme,” Miller said. “And both parties have a poverty of ideas.”
One of the thoughts that Miller wants to focus on is the misguided-but-popular sentiment from another Republican of his youth, Ronald Reagan. Though Miller credits Reagan for his charisma and communication, he said his messaging was wrong.
“We need to get away from this idea that government is your mortal enemy,” Miller said. “The government is not an alien force that wants to invade.”
 The Montana Second District race

Miller filed with the Federal Election Commission to run on Oct. 9, 2025.
According to the Federal Election website, Dr. Michael Eisenhauer of Great Falls filed to run in the race as an Independent on Dec. 15, 2025.
Incumbent Troy Downing has also filed paperwork to run for re-election.

(Photo  by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Twin Cities Tuesday as the Trump administration launches what it’s calling “the largest DHS operation ever.”
CBS News reported over the weekend that around 2,000 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents are being deployed in Minnesota, in addition to the 700 already present in the state as part of “Operation Metro Surge,” which began in December.
In a video posted to the Department of Homeland Security’s official X account, Noem and several heavily armed and masked agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In another video, Noem appeared to greet and thank local ICE staff.
One photo showed Noem meeting with Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who is leading the prosecutions of people accused of defrauding Minnesota’s social services programs.
The Trump administration’s focus on Minnesota was sparked by unsubstantiated allegations shared by right-wing media figures that Somali Americans who committed fraud were using the proceeds to fund terrorist organizations abroad.
“@POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have rallied DHS law enforcement personnel to keep Americans safe and ERADICATE fraud,” DHS posted on X.
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s requests for comment.
Immigrant rights organizations have been fielding many reports of ICE arrests around the metro, but an exact number of arrests is difficult to confirm. Unlike a few high-profile raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025, which involved dozens of agents and attracted large crowds, ICE appears to be focused on conducting smaller and faster operations.
Walz blasted the deployment as a waste of government resources on social media, sharing a video from a little over a week ago showing dozens of agents leading a single person out of a Hennepin County government building. He said the Trump administration did not give his office advance notice or any additional information on the operation.
“We have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us that are for a show of the cameras,” Walz said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We don’t even know they are, they’ll be wearing masks.”
Noem fired back at the governor for accusing them of misusing taxpayer dollars given the widening scandal of fraud in state-run social service programs that led him to end his campaign for a third term on Monday.
Around the country and in Minnesota, immigration agents have been accused of violating constitutional rights: detaining U.S. citizens for days, targeting individuals based on their speech; and arresting and holding people without probable cause.

In late December, ICE agents entered a private area of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis without a judicial warrant, according to immigrant rights activists and Democratic elected officials, who urged Hennepin Healthcare to adopt a clear policy and train employees on how to interact with immigration agents.
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a pediatrician and president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said fear of ICE is keeping immigrant families from seeking health care.
“There is a sense of fear that has been perpetuated by our administration, and we need hospitals to step up,” Gewirtz O’Brien said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and three Minnesota-based law firms recently sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that ICE agents and their leaders are also routinely violating the constitutional rights of the people protesting their actions.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Senate Majority Leader Mason announces 2026 gubernatorial run


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday January 7, 2026 11:51 am





Former Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced his run to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills on his podcast Wednesday morning, framing his campaign around the need for experienced leadership.
Mason, a Republican from Lisbon who spent eight years in the Maine Legislature and now works as a lobbyist, ran for governor in 2018 and was the runner up in the primary. On Wednesday, he commented on the crowded race he’s joining, saying he is the only Republican candidate with prior experience and understanding of how the Legislature works.
While state Sen. James Libby is among those running, the GOP primary field is packed with candidates with mostly business experience, such as former Planet Fitness president Ben Midgley, health care entrepreneur Jonathan Bush and David Jones, a construction and real estate business leader.
On the podcast, he said many candidates on both sides are “promising things that a governor cannot deliver on at all, or immediately.”
“The reason I’m running is very simple,” Mason said. “It’s not because I have better ideas. It’s because I know how to actually turn those ideas into results.”

Independent who previously tried to challenge Sen. Collins announces gubernatorial bid


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Friday November 7, 2025 3:57 pm





Another independent candidate has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. 
Derek Levasseur, who describes himself as a small business leader and published a memoir earlier this year about overcoming adversity, announced his plans to run for governor as an independent in a Facebook post Thursday. He filed paperwork with the Maine Ethics Commission the same day listing a Benton address. 
Levasseur said his focus is lowering the cost of living and reforming the state Department of Health and Human Services to increase accountability. He proposes eliminating property taxes on people’s primary homes and increasing government transparency.

Maine House Speaker Fecteau backs Pingree for governor


By: Lauren McCauley and AnnMarie Hilton -  1:44 pm





The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor.
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election.
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta.
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators.
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner at a packed rally at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland on Labor Day.
Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

AZ Family, a local news outlet in Phoenix, first reported on Avelo’s decision to end its deportation flights, which began out of Arizona last May — prompting a New Haven-based boycott movement, condemnation from politicians and activists across the country, and frequent protests outside of Tweed New Haven Airport, where Avelo has been flying direct commercial flights (but not deportation flights) since November 2021.
Avelo CEO Andrew Levy previously defended the company’s decision to run deportation flights on financial grounds, stating that the DHS contract was necessary to maintain Avelo’s operations, including its service of New Haveners. Click here to read an American Prospect report from November 2025 on Avelo’s “sloppy, dangerous deportation flights.”
“The big lesson here is that human suffering is not profitable,” said Pastor Jack Perkins Davidson of Hamden’s Spring Glen Church in a phone interview with the Independent Wednesday. “I hope Avelo and all corporations in the U.S. have learned that valuable lesson, that collaborating with injustice and collaborating with racism, though it may for them provide the allure of short-term gain, are empty promises. There is no benefit.”
Avelo doubles down on Tweed
Goff’s confirmation of Avelo’s decision to stop flying deportation flights also comes a day after she sent out a separate email press release Tuesday night under the subject line: “Avelo Airlines Reiterates Long-Term Commitment to Connecticut.”
“Avelo Airlines has been recapitalized, and its cash position is now one of the strongest in the U.S. airline industry relative to its size,” that Tuesday press release states. “The airline will use this cash infusion and balance sheet strength to execute its long-term strategy, with emphasis on further developing its key base at Tweed-New Haven Airport (HVN).”
The press release states that Avelo will “continue to operate a six-aircraft base” at Tweed “without major changes to the existing network or to its Crewmember employment at the airport.”
Across the country, Avelo will be “streamlining its network” around four different locations: New Haven’s Tweed airport (HVN); Wilmington, Delaware’s ILG airport; Charlotte, North Carolina’s Douglas International Airport (USA), and Lakeland, Florida’s airport (LAL). Avelo will also open a base at the McKinney, Texas airport (TKI) in “late 2026,” and it will close bases in Mesa, Arizona (AZA); Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina (RDU); and Wilmington, North Carolina (ILM).
“Concurrent with these network changes, Avelo will make near-term schedule changes that will impact many Customer itineraries. Communication will be sent directly to impacted Customers by email and text. Customers needing additional help can seek assistance from Avelo’s Customer Support Center.”
Avelo will also modify its fleet to remove six Boeing Next-Generation 737-700 aircraft, “leaving the airline primarily operating its more efficient Boeing Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft. These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company’s recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft.”
Tuesday’s press release ends by stating that Avelo will continue to fly directly from Tweed to the following 24 destinations:

Atlanta, Ga. (ATL)
Charleston, S.C. (CHS)
Charlotte / Concord, N.C. (USA)
Chicago, Ill. (via ORD)
Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas (DFW)
Daytona Beach, Fla. (DAB)
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (FLL)
Fort Myers, Fla. (RSW)
Greenville / Spartanburg, S.C. (GSP)
Houston, Texas (Hobby) (HOU)
Jacksonville, Fla. (JAX)
Key West, Fla. (EYW)
Lakeland / Orlando, Fla. (LAL)
Myrtle Beach, S.C. (MYR)
Nashville, Tenn. (BNA)
Orlando, Fla. (MCO)
Raleigh / Durham, N.C. (RDU)
San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU)
Sarasota / Bradenton, Fla. (SRQ)
Savannah, Ga. / Hilton Head, S.C. (SAV)
Tampa, Fla. (TPA)
Washington, D.C./Baltimore, Md. (BWI)
West Palm Beach, Fla. (PBI)
Wilmington, N.C. (ILM)

“New Haven is Avelo’s largest base – employing nearly 300 Crewmembers and offering service to 24 nonstop destinations,” Tuesday’s press release states. “Since taking flight from HVN in November 2021, Avelo has flown more than four million Customers at Tweed on over 30,000 flights.”
All of this comes as Tweed New Haven Airport continues to move forward with plans to extend its runway and build a new, larger terminal on the East Haven side of the property in a bid to attract more commercial airfare. Avelo and fellow budget airline Breeze are the only two commercial carriers currently operating out of Tweed. Critics of the airport’s expansion, meanwhile, have consistently warned of increased flooding, air pollution, and excess noise and traffic that comes with a larger airport.

The Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter has launched a new free online tool aimed at helping Delaware residents evaluate their daily habits and take steps to support long-term brain health.
The Brain Health Habit Builder is a web-based, interactive experience that takes about three to five minutes to complete. Users answer questions about their lifestyle, then receive a personalized plan focused on small, manageable changes tied to brain health. The plan can be downloaded, printed, or shared, and the tool is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
“Healthy habits can help you live better now and protect your memory and thinking as you age,” said Kristina Fransel, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “This new tool makes it easy to check your habits and build a personalized plan to support lifelong brain health.”
RELATED STORY: Delaware Faces an Alzheimer’s Surge—and a Growing Web of Challenges
The recommendations generated by the tool are informed by findings from the U.S. POINTER study, a large clinical trial that examined whether lifestyle interventions could improve cognitive function in older adults at risk for cognitive decline. The study found that a combination of physical activity, healthy eating, cognitive and social engagement, and regular health monitoring led to improved cognition.
Brain health refers to how well people think, learn, and remember. While research continues to evolve, studies increasingly suggest that addressing certain risk factors — such as inactivity, poor diet, and social isolation — may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and possibly dementia.
The Alzheimer’s Association has expanded its public education efforts in recent years, offering community programs across Delaware and sharing research-based guidance through initiatives like its 10 Healthy Habits for Your Brain campaign.
The Brain Health Habit Builder is the first in a series of new resources planned by the organization following the release of the U.S. POINTER study results. Future initiatives include virtual brain health training for health care providers, a community recognition program highlighting businesses that promote brain-healthy practices, and a brain health roundtable designed to bring together leaders from health care, public health, and the private sector.
“The Alzheimer’s Association is committed to ensuring individuals have the information they need to routinely and meaningfully take action to improve their brain health,” Fransel said. “Making even small changes to improve brain health can make a big difference.”
Delaware residents can access the Brain Health Habit Builder at alz.org/habitbuilder.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercurySince last summer the Virginia Department of Health has been investigating a potential pediatric cancer cluster in Southwest Virginia. On Wednesday, the agency announced it determined that the cancer rates don’t meet federal standards to be officially defined as a cancer cluster. 
Cancer clusters are defined as a greater than expected number of the same or related cancer cases that occur within a group of people in the same area over a specific time. Cancer clusters are rare, but could be indicative of environmental exposures or genetic predispositions but they sometimes randomly occur. VDH’s analysis of cases between 2014 and 2023 in the Scott County area of Virginia do not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for a cluster. 
Though an official cluster has not been determined, the regional health district director emphasized that health officials are still keeping their eyes on matters — especially since some data for 2024 and 2025 are not yet finalized.
“The results of the current investigation are being shared, but our work will not stop here,” said LENOWISCO Health District Director Reisa Sloce. “We will continue to provide the Virginia Cancer Registry with any additional pediatric cancer information we receive to ensure the most recent cases are reviewed as that data becomes more complete.”
Data takes time to be finalized as it must be verified, analyzed and exchanged with other state registries. A two-year lag in health data is common across other states, so VDH plans to review the most recent data once the formal procedures make it fully available. 
As to what VDH has learned so far, it received 24 survey responses from residents of Scott, Lee and Wise countries. Half of the reports stemmed from Scott, so much of the investigation focused in that area. A total of eight cases of pediatric cancers from survey responses met the criteria for the analysis. 
Staff reviewed each patient’s medical reports to confirm the type of cancer, where the cancer originated within the patient’s body and when it was diagnosed. The reviews included doctors’ notes and test results. Environmental factors were also examined such as radon levels, drinking water quality, and industrial site concerns but no link to environmental factors were identified in VDH’s analysis. 
The Virginia Mercury also conducted its own survey but only received one response. That person did not have pediatric cancer, but was an adult who had cancer in 2015 and said it had returned last year. The person was from Scott County. 
With a cancer cluster ruled out for now, fresh data will be on the horizon. 
In the meantime, Sloce reiterated how state health workers “strive to connect you with available resources and address health related concerns.”

(Photo via Garrett Mason official Maine Senate Facebook page)Former Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced his run to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills on his podcast Wednesday morning, framing his campaign around the need for experienced leadership.
Mason, a Republican from Lisbon who spent eight years in the Maine Legislature and now works as a lobbyist, ran for governor in 2018 and was the runner up in the primary. On Wednesday, he commented on the crowded race he’s joining, saying he is the only Republican candidate with prior experience and understanding of how the Legislature works. 
While state Sen. James Libby is among those running, the GOP primary field is packed with candidates with mostly business experience, such as former Planet Fitness president Ben Midgley, health care entrepreneur Jonathan Bush and David Jones, a construction and real estate business leader.
On the podcast, he said many candidates on both sides are “promising things that a governor cannot deliver on at all, or immediately.”
“The reason I’m running is very simple,” Mason said. “It’s not because I have better ideas. It’s because I know how to actually turn those ideas into results.”
The former Senate majority leader emphasized that Maine requires seasoned leadership at such a crucial moment for the state, not someone who tries to imitate Donald Trump or a political “hobbyist.” 
Mason admitted to having similar views to the other Republican candidates, highlighting key talking points for the party including overtaxation and government inefficiency, education reform, and rising crime — despite the most recent state report showing crime declining steadily since 2021. 
But drawing on his past roles as a business owner and legislator, Mason set himself apart as someone who could bring practical experience to the job. His entry into the race signals a major development in the Republican primary. 
“I’ve heard a lot of people in the Republican primary talk about how they’re an outsider,” he said. “There are times for outsiders. There are times that we need somebody to come in and rattle up the system. This is not this time. This moment requires precision. It requires institutional knowledge, and it involves understanding the real levers of power.”

Jim Pillen touts $10 million campaign war chest ahead of 2026 reelection bid,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-touts-10-million-campaign-war-chest-ahead-of-2026-reelection-bid/,Pillen's haul sets steep cost of challenging sitting governor as potential GOP rematch with Charles Herbster looms.,"Gov. Jim Pillen at Nebraska’s National Guard Air Base on Jan 5, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Fresh off securing President Donald Trump’s endorsement, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced his campaign has raised $7.6 million, bringing the governor’s political war chest to $10 million ahead of his 2026 reelection bid. 
The incumbent governor’s fundraising haul comes as a potential Republican primary election rematch is on the horizon with multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster, a longtime Trump donor. 
The Pillen campaign said the amount is “almost seven times” that of any previous incumbent governor going into reelection. Pillen finished 2024 with more than $3 million in cash on hand, according to state campaign finance reports.
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who studies political behavior, said, “This massive war chest creates a David vs. Goliath situation for potential challengers.”

Herbster and his team declined to comment. He and Pillen combined in 2022 for the most expensive gubernatorial primary contest and governor’s race in state history, with both raising and spending more than $11 million. 
Herbster lost to Pillen in that 2022 GOP primary, finishing second in a three-way race that also included then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd District. 
Pillen then cruised to a general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue. If a GOP primary rematch happens, Herbster will have to run without Trump’s endorsement this time, which he had in 2022.
Trump backing Pillen is a dramatic change from the last time Herbster faced the former University of Nebraska regent in a GOP-led state where Republicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage.
Herbster is expected to decide whether to run as early as this month. He continued his social media attacks on Pillen last week, saying Pillen is “running the state into the ground,” referring to the state budget shortfall. 
Currently, Jacy Todd and Sheila Korth-Focken, who announced late Monday, are the other two GOP candidates for governor. They haven’t yet filed fundraising tallies with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission, which are required after candidates raise more than $5,000.
On the Democratic side, former state Sen. Lynne Walz is exploring a bid for governor. Walz spokesman Brandon Bayer said Pillen’s fundraising totals would have no impact on her decision to run. 
The GOP primary for governor is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 15:40:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Latin Americans in CT have mixed emotions about Maduro’s capture,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public and Daniela Doncel | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/latin-americans-in-ct-have-mixed-emotions-about-maduros-capture/,"In CT's small Venezuelan American community, some are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. apprehension of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.","Some members of Connecticut’s small Venezuelan American community are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. military’s apprehension of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.
Norwalk resident Fabian Durango, originally from Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, said he’s relieved Maduro has been removed from power.
“This was long overdue, glad it was done,” Durango said. “I’m glad it was done clean and swiftly.”
Durango, who emigrated from Venezuela with his parents at the age of 10, has not been to the country in years. He said he has multiple family members in Caracas, several of whom saw low-flying aircraft as Saturday’s raid unfolded. Durango said his family left the country during a period of civil strife in 1990, years before Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, won a presidential election.
Now Durango hopes Venezuela, which suffers from a faltering economy as a result of international sanctions and government mismanagement, can chart a new course. He remains optimistic despite his concerns over the U.S. government’s intentions, which President Donald Trump openly said was about regaining access to the country’s vast oil reserves.
“Our president is an aggressive businessman … they’re neither good or bad, but they prey on the weak … and I do worry that this is just going to be a rush for natural resources and minerals,” Durango said.
Clodomiro Falcón, president of Asoven CT, the Association of Venezuelans in Connecticut, said he’s optimistic. Falcón noted his opinions were not the official position of Asoven.
“I am very hopeful, but I understand at the same time taking Maduro away is part of a process that is very complex, a process that is not overnight,” Falcón said.
Falcón entered the United States in 1986, to pursue higher education. He said he did not leave Venezuela due to economic or political reasons, but ended up staying in the United States after he completed his education.
But Falcón kept close ties with family in the country, traveling regularly to visit until 2016, and cited his passport expiring at the time, and later, travel advisories to the country preventing him from returning.
“There is a lot of narrative, a lot of lies in Venezuela, in the narrative from the regime saying that Venezuela was at peace, that Venezuela was perfect, was heaven, that’s all lies,” Falcón said.
Venezuela’s economic troubles, according to previous reporting from NPR, turned many into refugees, fleeing soaring inflation in recent years, and violent political repression as the economy suffered from growing income inequality. Some of those refugees entered the United States in recent years, facing xenophobia due to alleged connections with organized crime and drug trafficking, although the New York Times contested those connections in its reporting.
While many Venezuelan refugees are not criminals, Falcon said his homeland is governed by them, and took issue with demonstrations criticizing American involvement in Venezuela.
“I think these people don’t understand that they are not attacking Venezuela,” Falcón said. “This is attacking a criminal organization.”
Falcón hopes he can travel to the country, provided the Maduro government is completely removed from power.
“I pray to the Lord that I am alive, and healthy to be able to see Venezuela again,” Falcón said.
Mixed emotions beyond Venezuela
Trump has alluded to the possibility of more U.S. military action against other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Colombia.
The implications have left Colombian American Amy Carmona feeling uncertain about what the future may hold for her family in Medellín, the Colombian “City of Eternal Spring.”
Carmona is a sophomore at the University of Connecticut and the PR Chair of PorColombia, UConn’s Colombian Student Association.
“Obviously, [Colombian President Gustavo] Petro has a very unfortunate reign over the country right now, but I think that it’s super unethical to go about and do the same thing,” Carmona said.
She said she can’t overlook the repercussions that may come to Venezuela after the extraction, comparing the situation to the lack of structure and stability in Iraq after Saddam Hussein.
Carmona said she also can’t ignore the Trump Administration’s intentions with Venezuela’s oil. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has pointed to that as well, stating that the operation on Venezuela is about “enriching Trump’s oil industry backers.”
Carmona’s biggest worry, however, is the lack of concern for the situation among her family and other Colombians.
She was in Medellín during the operation on Saturday, visiting family for the holidays. As she watched the story of Maduro’s removal unfold on social media, Carmona said her family was celebrating.
“My family is very happy. They’re rejoicing about it. I haven’t really heard any critics say anything. It’s mainly just people from the United States that have seen this before with other invasions of countries, but obviously a third world country is going to be appreciative of the fact that prices would go down, or there’s opportunity for another leader,” Carmona said.
Petro’s response to Trump, in which he warns Trump that he will retaliate should Trump attack, also has Carmona feeling like Colombians aren’t really worried about a strike from the U.S.
“I feel like people aren’t really taking it as seriously as it is, mainly because I don’t think people know about the implications,” Carmona said.
Those implications being what could happen to Colombia if Petro is taken the same way Maduro was.
“I’m unsure if the country would go into the right hands in this situation, because the Guerrilla presence is so strong here. I think that it could honestly go either way,” she said.
Reports have come out that the National Liberation Army (ELN), a left-wing rebel group in Colombia, is preparing for a possible military intervention from the U.S.
The idea already has Carmona feeling jumpy.
“Honestly, [Sunday] night, I can tell you that I heard a loud noise. I was like, ‘Oh my God. This is it?’” Carmona said.
Carmona is encouraging others who share the same fears to stay informed and keep the faith.
“Having faith right now in such a troubling time is so important, because if you don’t believe in something, you can very easily be steered in the wrong direction,” Carmona said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Resolutions become reality as goals turn into achievements.","The new year offers an opportunity to reflect upon aspirations—and commit to the work needed to achieve them. Students of all ages are putting in the effort to bring their goals to fruition. Education continues to shape pathways for learners at every stage, and 2026 brings new possibilities for learning of all kinds. The stories revisited below highlight seven student experiences.
Full-time firefighting is in Bailey’s future
Bailey Shepard’s goal grew from the sense of belonging he felt the minute he put on a firefighter’s helmet as a child. As he matured, he knew he would turn his volunteer service into a full-time career as a firefighter and EMT. “I’d love to do it full time. I’m just waiting for a job to open up somewhere,” he says. 
In high school, Bailey attended a student leadership retreat organized by VSAC. It turned out to be a transformative experience, giving him the skills he needed to cement his lifelong commitment to helping others. He joined a volunteer fire department as soon as he turned 16 and attributes his dedication to the guidance and leadership experience he gained from his VSAC program. “A big part of the job is taking charge in emergency response situations. I use those leadership skills I built with VSAC almost every day,” he shared.
As he looks to his future, Bailey is determined to continue making a difference for others. 
OJ Dreams of Hollywood or opening his own business
OJ Daring is open to where his path will take him, including Hollywood. A senior at Champlain College, OJ says, “I have a lot of different ideas. Hollywood has always been the dream, but I could also see myself going the niche route—working in marketing for a company or starting a business of my own. Most important is being able to support myself,” he says.  
OJ is studying film and finance. He goes deeply into editing videos and working on a variety of film projects. An alumni of VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program, OJ says the support he received getting into and getting started at Champlain made all the difference. “The process was smooth for me because of VSAC. If I didn’t have that, I would have had a harder time. They helped me through the confusion, answered my questions, and made me feel confident.”
He’s finishing his senior year this semester. As to whether his path will take him to Hollywood, to owning his own business, working in marketing, or something else? Only time will tell. Either way, OJ is excited for a bright future. 
On the farm or in the field is where Hailey wants to be 
Hailey Bartlett is certain about one thing: she’s not interested in a desk job. Instead, she’s preparing for a hands-on career working with animals—as a veterinarian, veterinary technician, or animal nutritionist. What matters most to her is being directly involved with animal care and putting her animal science studies to practical use.
Hailey is currently in her first year at SUNY Cobleskill. She grew up around agriculture, showing animals through 4-H and spending much of her time with animal companions. During some of the most challenging periods of her high school years, working with animals—especially calves—became a positive and grounding outlet. She applied to college as an independent student and relied on VSAC for guidance in navigating the financial aid process, including completing the FAFSA and applying for scholarships.
Her experiences with animals and farm life have helped clarify the path she wants to pursue. Hailey’s journey is an exciting one, shaped by her interests.
Maria is building an engineering career, one proton at a time
Maria Tye first heard the words “chemical engineering” in high school, after excelling in chemistry and being encouraged to explore the field. She knew she wanted a stable future and set out to make it happen, despite challenges at home and financial hurdles. Maria spent hours researching colleges, completing applications, and applying for scholarships and grants. She balanced schoolwork with track, summer jobs in manufacturing, and internships, gaining hands-on experience while building the skills needed for her career.
When financial barriers threatened to derail her plans, she sought creative solutions, relying on family and mentors to help with loans. College demanded persistence, teamwork, and self-advocacy, and Maria leaned on peers and support systems to navigate a rigorous program and personal challenges.
Today, as a project engineer at Amphenol Aerospace, she bridges disciplines and works on innovative projects—proof that dedication, resourcefulness, and hard work can turn aspirations into reality.
Ailyn is headed toward the ocean
Ailyn Langley is confident her future lies with the ocean. “It’s fascinating and beautiful and I want to be able to look deeper into it,” she shares. 
A first-generation student, she’s in her first year at Dartmouth College where she’s focusing on marine biology and neuroscience. She grew up in West Fairlee and always gravitated toward nature and especially the world underwater. “Many parts of the ocean are misunderstood,” she says. Ailyn is determined to explore those things and has set great goals for herself in life and for her time at Dartmouth, including learning how to dive. 
She’s well on the way to achieving her dreams, one class at a time. 
Amara and Nick share roots, but have different goals
Twins Amara Chester and Nick Armstrong grew up in Pownal. Encouraged by their mother to explore beyond their hometown, both understood early that education could open doors—but reaching their goals required effort.
Amara discovered her passion for speech pathology through a high school human services class and a career skills assessment. She researched colleges, applied widely, and spent hours completing scholarship applications and financial aid forms to make attending Biola University in California possible. Today, she works in cognitive therapy, helping individuals recover from brain injuries while balancing life as a new mom.
Nick explored multiple interests before finding real estate through a college internship and hands-on home renovation experience. He carefully weighed schools, navigated applications and financial aid, and now works as a broker, manages investment properties, and plans to expand his business.
Amara and Nick’s dedication shows that ambition, hard work, and the right support can turn goals into reality.

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)In the latest blow to Minnesota’s once vaunted reputation for good governance, the Office of the Legislative Auditor has identified “continued and pervasive concerns” with grant-making practices at the Behavioral Health Administration, an arm of the Department of Human Services that assists people who struggle with substance abuse and mental health.
Appearing before a panel of lawmakers on Tuesday, Legislative Auditor Judy Randall outlined the findings of her office’s partial review of approximately $192 million of grants issued to 590 non-governmental entities between 2022 and 2024.
During the course of the investigation, she said, auditors “identified a number of documents that the Behavioral Health Administration either backdated or created after our audit began in response to our request for information.”
“Frankly, in the 27 years I’ve been with the OLA, we’ve never seen this before,” Randall said. “It’s very troubling. It wasn’t just one individual that created or backdated the documents. We do believe it was a systemic effort.”
Randall said such practices raise questions about the validity of the information provided by the agency, thus “undermining the integrity of the audit.”
Shireen Gandhi, acting commissioner of the DHS, told lawmakers on the Legislative Audit Commission that she was “shocked to hear this information.”
“It is absolutely unacceptable that any staff would provide anything other than accurate information of the work done to the auditor,” Gandhi said.
The audit identified other worrisome issues with the BHA’s grant-making practices, including a widespread and improper reliance on non-competitive “single source” bids; poor oversight of grantees; failure to conduct site visits; and lax documentation.
The most eye-catching detail in the report is suggestive of outright graft.
According to the audit, one unnamed grant manager with BHA approved a payment of $672,647 to a new vendor for a single month’s work, then left state employment a few days later. That grant manager subsequently provided consulting services to the provider.
“We asked BHA management whether they questioned such a large reimbursement request for just one month of work.  BHA management said that due to limited information in the grant management system and the grant manager no longer being available, they could not answer this question,” the report states.
When auditors contacted two subcontractors of the aforementioned provider, the report continues, neither subcontractor was able to “provide sufficient documentation regarding who they served with the money they received from the grantee.”
One subcontractor told auditors that the grantee “told them they did not need to keep detailed participant records, such as sign-up sheets.” Absent such documentation, the report states, auditors “could not determine whether subcontractors provided the services for which they were paid.”
Lawmakers reacted to the findings with disbelief.
“I’m floored. This is incredible,” said Rep. Patti Anderson, R-Dellwood, who noted that “half the grants had some sort of backdating or falsification of the documents.”
 “It wasn’t just one or two people. It was a big chunk of the staff. Someone must have told them to do that. Who told the staff to do that?” Anderson asked.
Gandhi responded that “if someone directed staff to falsify documents, it’s absolutely wrong.”
“It’s an HR matter for sure, it may be more than that,” Gandhi said.
In response to lawmakers’ queries about whether any of the issues identified in the report constituted criminal fraud, Gandhi said one internal audit conducted by DHS has been referred to law enforcement, but she provided no more details. 
While Republicans on the committee were harsher in their assessment of the agency’s failures, calls for reforms were bipartisan.
Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, the committee chair, said she expected there will be a change in law that will mandate “a cooling off period” for former department employees before they can be hired by grant recipients. 
For her part, Gandhi told lawmakers that the agency was working to improve training for grant managers and increase oversight. 
“I take the report seriously,” she said. “Strong internal controls are essential to protect taxpayers’ funds.”

StebbinsThe Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has reported progress on multiple longtime areas of concern in a set of reports summarizing its accomplishments in 2025.
With the agency, more commonly referred to as EGLE, overseeing issues like environmental contamination, clean water, and working alongside several partners to protect the Great Lakes and the species that call them home, its year end report for 2025 and its State of the Great Lakes report point to accomplishments like the delisting of Muskegon Lake as a Great Lakes Area of Concern while detailing its continued efforts in fighting algal blooms in Lake Erie, among other issues.
While there are more than 27,000 environmentally contaminated sites across the state, EGLE reported increased cleanup efforts, with the department working on 940 sites in 2025 compared to 870 in 2024. EGLE also addressed a larger number of leaking underground storage tanks, closing 561 sites in the 2025 fiscal year compared to 409 the year prior.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since 2020, EGLE has tripled the amount of storage tank leaks it addresses in a given year, agency director Phil Roos told Michigan Advance in an interview Tuesday.
The department has also plugged 292 of the 570 orphan wells in the state, sites used for oil, gas or brine disposal that were not closed properly and where the owner is either insolvent or cannot be identified.
The state also continued to identify sites contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, man-made chemicals used in fire fighting foam, nonstick cookware and a number of other products that have been tied to negative health impacts including increased risks for multiple types of cancer.
In 2026, the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team – established in 2017 by seven state agencies including the Department of Environmental Quality, EGLE’s predecessor – will award and administer grants to airports where firefighting foam has contaminated groundwater and surface water. The grants will be used for testing, studying best ways to address contamination, and cleaning out fire trucks to use newer firefighting foam.

EGLE has also taken steps to prevent the chemicals from being discharged into Michigan waterways with the department’s industrial pretreatment programs producing a 59% reduction of PFOS – a type of PFAS – on average and 99% reduction at some locations.
In addition to addressing PFAS, the department has also leveraged one-time funding from the Legislature to research microplastics in waters throughout the state. While the health impacts of these small pieces of plastic are still being researched, microplastics have been found throughout the human body and are suspected to harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health. 
The three EGLE departments overseeing microplastics research are focused on four main areas: establishing a better understanding of concentrations of microplastics in surface waters; improving understanding of microplastics in public drinking water supplies; identifying critical areas for future microplastics research; and developing a comprehensive statewide microplastics strategy beginning in 2026.
“I think it’s going to be really eye opening, and give us clarity at least about where to start, where the problem’s the biggest, what do we need to focus on,” Roos said. “It’s similar to the early days of PFAS, you know. There we had communities that were being directly impacted with significant health impacts and water contamination. Here, it’s been sort of a silent issue that we’re all concerned about.”
The state is also playing a part in addressing harmful algal blooms in the Western Lake Erie Basin, with EGLE working alongside the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to reduce the flow of nutrients that cause algal blooms from farmland into the basin over the next five years. 
In addition to its work on pollution and environmental quality, EGLE is also working alongside partners from state and federal agencies and tribal governments on species management, including efforts to address threats to whitefish populations, protect the endangered piping plover and keep invasive sea lampreys in check.
The Michigan Wild Rice Initiative – which is composed of the 12 federally recognized Anishinaabe Nations that share geography with Michigan, and several state agencies including EGLE – also released a stewardship guide on manoomin, or wild rice. The guide tells the story of manoomin from an Anishinaabe perspective centered on building a relationship with the grain as a central part of restoration and revitalization efforts. 
“I cannot stress the importance of that resource for our friends in the tribal communities in the state. Literally, it’s such a central point of their culture and also their livelihood,” Roos said.

Moving into this year, Roos said drinking water will continue to be a main priority for EGLE, especially the state’s efforts to replace lead water lines. 
“I think we’re going to have access to a bit more money in terms of lead service line replacement money this year,” Roos said. “And the reason is that we met a requirement a lot of other states didn’t necessarily meet, which is we were the first state to achieve a statewide inventory of lead service lines.”
The department will also remain focused on making progress on contaminated sites, Roos said, with plans to improve how it staffs sites and how it categorizes the environmental risk at each site.
Another piece of that effort is EGLE’s brownfield redevelopment program, which cleans up contaminated sites so they can be used for housing, business and community needs like parks or recreation centers. 
“We’re going to try to step that up another level in the next year,” Roos said. “We have legislation Rep. [Alabas] Farhat (D-Dearborn) has sponsored which would remove some of the red tape and give us more flexibility in what sites we can use the Brownfield program for.”
Under the current system, grants and loans for each site are capped at $1 million, which Roos said has limited the sites they are able to redevelop. One of the changes within Farhat’s legislation would double that cap to $2 million, marking the first increase since the program began in 1998. 
Building on previous efforts, Roos said the department will also be placing an increased focus on storm water management and dam safety. 
There are a number of dams throughout the state that are in bad shape, Roos said, some of which have owners who have not invested in necessary maintenance and some that have either outlived or are approaching the end of their useful lives.
“You’re going to see a lot of efforts for us to get out in front of that,” Roos said “We’ve had a very successful dam safety fund that we’re just about out of money on. We’re going to hope to get a little help from the Legislature on that.”

The department will also continue to focus on clean and affordable energy Roos said, noting that it will be expanding its home energy rebate program, which provides funding to address the upfront costs of energy efficiency upgrades like insulation, air sealing and heating and cooling, as well as the purchase of electrical appliances, wiring upgrades or buying a heat pump for heating and cooling their household.
Roos also pointed to EGLE’s Renewables Ready Communities program, which provides funding to communities that adopt large-scale solar energy, wind or battery storage. 
While Michigan Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration over the decision to revoke funding for the Solar For All Program, Roos noted that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan, which set Michigan’s goal of reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 predates the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which brought an influx of funding and incentives to support the transition to clean energy, including the Solar For All program.

Although EGLE plans to “fight like hell” to get its Solar For All funding back, Roos said, there are other funding mechanisms for programs like Renewables Ready Communities that will help the state to reach its clean energy and climate goals. 
Between a 40% pause in its funding as a result of the Trump Administration’s attempted pause on federal grants and loans, and modest cuts to its budget, EGLE has weathered a lot in the past year, Roos said. Despite those challenges, Roos said he’s proud and thankful the department has been able to continue to provide its core functions alongside meeting its commitments.
However, further cuts could begin to threaten EGLE’s ability to deliver on protections for the residents of Michigan, Roos said.
“Despite everything we’re on our feet, we’re living our mission,” Roos said. “We’re doing everything we can to protect everybody in the state according to what we can under the law. But there’s not a lot of room to mess around here.”

(Getty Images)In the middle of December, a “grateful” John Sununu shared a list of new endorsers for his U.S. Senate campaign, through which he plans to “bring New Hampshire common-sense” to Washington.
Among those new supporters, as the memo’s headline trumpets, is New Hampshire House Majority Leader Jason Osborne.
Despite the Sununu family’s persistent desire to be embraced as moderate conservatives in this immoderate age, and Osborne’s entrenched position in the far right of the state’s Republican Party, the two aren’t exactly strange bedfellows. With Osborne’s endorsement, Sununu will receive a necessary primary bump with New Hampshire right-wingers and, in return, Osborne gets to dip a toe in the mainstream and gain a direct line of communication to a potential U.S. senator. Maybe the fringe, anti-government, Free State Project philosophy of a transplant from Defiance, Ohio, is what passes as “New Hampshire common-sense” these days. 
Ain’t politics grand?
A review of Osborne’s sponsored bills for 2026 sheds some light on his political commonality with former Gov. Chris Sununu’s big brother. The House majority leader would love to see, for example, another rate reduction for the business enterprise tax and the repeal of the communications services tax. I suspect Sununu would be on board with both bills if he had his sights set on the State House rather than the Capitol. And because of the overall Republican fervor for any and all methods of dismantling public education, it’s not hard to imagine Sununu nodding his approval of Osborne’s efforts to “establish a local education freedom account program,” launch a study committee for “transitioning all public schools to public charter schools,” and create a system of open enrollment that would almost certainly close countless community schools in property-poor districts.
But what about some of Osborne’s other pieces of proposed legislation, such as his jingoistic outline for how teachers should be directed to talk about inequality, race, and sexuality, or a bill to repeal the refugee resettlement program? Or how about Osborne’s use of racial slurs and his general callousness?
It almost certainly doesn’t matter to Republican voters. To be a modern Republican is to declare that there is very little you won’t endorse, whether through applause or silence, to accomplish whatever it was that made you a conservative to begin with.
What’s a little violent persecution of certain immigrant populations, based on skin color, if it means the furtherance of “school choice”? 
What’s a bit of brazen profiteering by the nation’s First Family if it means tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans?
What does a clear violation of foreign sovereignty, and another plunge into the morass of nation-building, matter if it means cheaper fossil fuels in the short term for Americans?
Around the same time Sununu sent out his memo of new endorsements, I received an email from a reader who disagreed with something I had written about the state’s approach to taxation. It was a critical but cordial letter, but in a follow-up the writer reprimanded me in a way that has been sloshing around in my brain ever since: “I would prefer that you refer to Republican Leadership rather than Republicans,” he wrote. “There is a difference. Not all Republicans agree with the Leadership.”
That Republican voters would consider politicians that they elected to serve and lead to be somehow disconnected from their own political desires is remarkable to me. It’s one thing if a politician pulled a 180 after an election, in which case the voter is a victim of fraud, with restitution to be paid in the form of an election defeat the next time around. But nothing that’s happening now at the hands of Republican majorities is a surprise, here in Concord or in Washington. The administrations in power never missed an opportunity on the trail to articulate just how black and white they viewed the world, nor did they underplay the inhuman lengths to which they would go to prosecute and punish the people they consider unworthy of an American existence.
The slowly unraveling narrator of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” asks, amid his deep disillusionment in a postwar America incapable of bridging its violent divisions, whether politics could ever be “an expression of love.” I’m not sure how readers answered that question in 1952, but here in 2026 a “hell no” echoes through policy after policy drafted by a ruling party that is fully committed to broadly inflicting love’s opposite.
I get the sense from Republicans like Sununu and my letter writer that many in the party still see the president as some kind of an outlier, a useful but impermanent disfigurement of the party’s core principles. But this president’s role isn’t as some kind of singular architect but rather as a performer who effectively channels the many currents that electrify his party. That job is a walk in the park for a man who desires power above all else and pays no mind to the means by which that power is acquired, secured, and exercised. To believe that Republican leaders will return to some level of restraint once he’s gone is to disregard the historic allure of unfettered control of political levers. 
Do the moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents who are quietly riding out the present darkness (while privately celebrating any ideological victories that darkness has delivered) really believe that things will eventually snap back to some kind of more palatable centrism? Do they think the president’s personal ambition is somehow unique, that others aren’t lined up to grasp the same reins in exactly the same manner the very second this president releases them, by fate or by force?
Or maybe I’m overthinking it and the key to living as a modern old-school Republican in these cold days is just to pocket what you can while disavowing the sins of the motley coalition it took to get it. And then maybe a small prayer, of fluctuating urgency, that the genie will put itself back in the bottle before things go too far.
If that’s the case, I’m afraid I have some bad news.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/modernGOP-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

(Photo on left by WEWS, photo on right provided.)David Pepper, the former chair of the Ohio Democrats, has been tapped as Dr. Amy Acton’s running mate in the 2026 governor race.
Pepper, an attorney from Cincinnati, Ohio, was predicted by both Democratic and Republican strategists as Acton’s running mate.
“I am proud to select David Pepper as my Lieutenant Governor. We both share a lifelong commitment to fighting for Ohio’s working families and making our state a more affordable place to live for all of us. David is an innovative and pragmatic leader who has been laser-focused on delivering for Ohioans for his entire career, from reducing the property tax rate for Cincinnatians to tackling foreclosures during the 2008 recession,” Acton said in a statement.
“I am thrilled to have David by my side in the fight to lower costs, tackle corruption and special interests, and ensure that every Ohio family can thrive and enjoy the quality of life we all deserve.”
Pepper, 54, has been supporting Acton, 59, for years. In our coverage of her campaign, Pepper has been the Democratic strategist cheering her on.
“Someone starting from no political background in such a short amount of time built such a massive base that only grows,” Pepper said back in July.
He also defended Acton’s work during the pandemic back in 2020.
Pepper served on the Cincinnati City Council and Hamilton County Board of Commissioners for years.
While on the Commission, he helped cut spending by $60 million, according to the campaign. He introduced a prescription drug discount program for Hamilton County, helped create a foreclosure prevention program and led an earned income tax credit initiative.
During his tenure on Council, he focused on affordability and public safety.
“I am honored and humbled to be joining Amy’s ticket and partnering with her in the fight to deliver for Ohio’s working families. Amy is the only candidate in this race who will tackle our affordability crisis and work to lower costs, tackle corruption, and invest in our public schools, so we can finally put working families first, not billionaires or special interests,” Pepper said in a statement.
“While our opponent is flying around our state in his private jet and moving his business from Cincinnati to Texas, we’re working to tackle the affordability crisis and create an Ohio where we can all get ahead.”
Pepper is a well-known name in Ohio politics, and one of the reasons is his outspoken nature. His X account boasts nearly 110,000 followers. He has also written several books about democracy.
He has been called by other strategists an essential political donor to Democratic causes.
“Ohio families are struggling to make ends meet, and Amy and David are the right choice to take on lowering costs, tackle the rampant corruption and special interests in our state and ensure that every Ohio family can thrive. The Acton campaign is the only choice in this race to fight for Ohio and put our state first,” Ted Strickland, Ohio’s former governor, said.
Pepper’s background
After growing up in Southwest Ohio, he graduated from Yale University and went to Yale Law School.
Pepper and his wife live in Cincinnati with their two children.

Chynah Tyler of Boston misspent campaign funds on personal uses such as Uber Eats orders, and failed to document details behind about $4,500 in other spending.","THE STATE’S CAMPAIGN FINANCE laws are notoriously generous when it comes to the kinds of things politicians can spend money on from their campaign accounts. They can use donations to their campaign on anything that furthers their political interests, a mile-wide definition that has seen state regulators give the green light to expenditures on everything from pricey steak dinners with colleagues to suites at the Beanpot college hockey tournament.
Despite rules that stretch allowable spending to include sometimes eyebrow-raising uses, Beacon Hill officials still seem to regularly manage to find themselves dinged by regulators for stepping beyond those limits.
The latest pol in the unwanted spotlight: state Rep. Chynah Tyler of Boston. Uber Eats, audiobooks, and thousands of dollars in unexplained spending have landed the Roxbury pol in hot water with state political finance regulators.
The Office of Campaign and Political Finance alleged that Tyler misused money from her campaign account for personal expenses in violation of state law, plus ran afoul of other reporting deadlines and record-keeping requirements.
Under the terms of an agreement made public Tuesday, Tyler will pay a $6,000 civil forfeiture to the state and to submit to greater campaign-finance scrutiny by OCPF for the next six months.
Regulators said Tyler made more than $800 in personal expenses “in error” from her campaign account between April 1 and October 20, which she repaid after OCPF inquired.
The office said Tyler’s team did not provide records to explain nearly $4,500 in additional expenses. State law presumes that any campaign spending without supporting documentation is made for personal use.
Tyler did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
In an eight-paragraph statement included in the disposition agreement, Tyler said she gave birth in early 2025 — several months before the alleged personal spending from her campaign account — “and experienced limited mobility during that time, which impacted my ability to personally oversee certain campaign finance activities.”
On August 29, Tyler repaid her campaign committee $726 for personal expenses, and she repaid another $101 on November 2025.
While Tyler wrote in her OCPF statement that she reimbursed her campaign for personal spending “to ensure full compliance,” she did not provide any explanation of the $4,500 that regulators say was not properly documented.
Revised campaign finance reports now include multiple entries labeled “personal expense made in error,” such as a pair of Uber Eats orders, two separate $16.99 “recurring” charges for audiobook service Audible, and a $223 expense at Aicha’s African Hair Braiding in Dorchester.
Regulators dinged Tyler for several other reasons, too. They said her campaign failed to file reports in a timely manner detailing more than $13,000 in deposits between May 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, which have since been submitted.
Tyler also allegedly received about $900 in combined contributions above the allowable limit from three people. While the campaign said it refunded the excess donations, OCPF wrote that Tyler’s camp did not submit any documentation to support that claim.
The five-term rep, who previously led the Legislature’s Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, owes $1,000 to the state immediately and will repay the remainder of the balance over a period of up to 10 months.
Tyler also agreed for her committee to provide OCPF with invoices, receipts, and other documentation covering all expenditures each month to undergo private regulatory review for six months.
It’s not the first time OCPF has chided Tyler for putting campaign dollars toward personal uses. In 2018, Tyler used $1,600 from her committee account as a “personal loan,” which she later repaid to her campaign.
Several lawmakers in recent years have triggered federal scrutiny through their spending habits.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas House higher education budget committee didn’t wait for start of the 2026 legislative session to take a dive into millions of dollars in pending budget requests for public universities.
Rep. Adam Turk, a Shawnee Republican who chairs the committee, convened Republicans and Democrats during what he referred to as “zero week” rather than await start of the session Monday. The objective was to get a jumpstart on presentations and discussions about budget earmarks for Wichita State University, Kansas State University, University of Kansas, Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg State University and Emporia State University.
The Legislature’s interim budget committee previously rejected in late 2024 a series of proposals for university budget enhancements and hiring new campus personnel. In addition, that joint House and Senate budget committee said unused funding in current budgets could be seized and reappropriated in the new budget.
At this stage, administrators at the six state universities in Kansas began making sales pitches to the Republican-led House higher education budget committee for possible restoration of their requests.
“It is my intent to bring a quality product to the next level,” Turk said. “We can’t afford it to be unclear or indecisive or arbitrary in any way. I graduated from none of these institutions. I’ve got no dog in this hunt. You won’t see me playing favorites. Nothing is personal in here. It is math.”
Lawrence Rep. Mike Amyx, the ranking Democrat on the higher education committee, said he would focus on developing a budget plan that invested in delivery of a high-quality college education.
“Do everything we can to come out with the best budget,” Amyx said.
During the day’s committee meeting, PSU President Thomas Newsom, FHSU President Tia Mason and interim ESU President Taylor Kriley shared budget and enrollment information with legislators. They outlined arguments for legislative support of individual budget requests.
Comments from several lawmakers indicated the focus of the House committee would be on decreasing state government spending on higher education.
“I see a lot of expansion, new stuff,” said Turk, the chairman. “It’s real easy to build something new. Really hard … to find the things that are not working anymore, cut them off.”
Newsom, who started in September at PSU after leading Southeastern Oklahoma State University for five years, said higher education needed to do a better job of deleting weak programs as it went about directing resources into promising programs. He said regional public universities such as PSU had to concentrate on making efficient use of public and private funding as well as being responsive to student and industry demands.
“We tend to add new toys to the toy box a lot without getting rid of old toys,” Newsom said.
He said PSU’s goal was to attract 700 new students over the next five years, which could infuse $6 million in tuition revenue into the university.
Mason, who has served as president of FHSU since 2018, said the university had the lowest tuition and fee rate among public universities in Kansas. FHSU successfully launched affiliation agreements with North Central Kansas Technical College and Northwest Kansas Technical College to create better academic pathways for students, find operational efficiencies and better serve the region’s economy.
“We view ourselves as an engine for social mobility,” she said. “Proving that a premium education doesn’t have to come with a premium price tag.”
Mason was asked for enrollment and financial information about FHSU’s online degree programs with two universities in China. FHSU last fall enrolled 3,000 students from China in English, business, leadership and health studies programs. The international students generated about $9 million in annual revenue, she said, but net revenue runs about $5 million per year. The funds were plowed into the FHSU campus in Hays, she said.
Rep. Bill Rhiley, a Republican from Wellington, said influx of tuition dollars from international programs had successfully subsidized tuition rates for Kansans attending FHSU. Mason concurred with Rhiley, and called that revenue a “game changer” in terms of tuition affordability.
Mason said FHSU students in China were linked to an IT system based in Singapore. A cybersecurity firm was hired FHSU to improve online computer systems, she said. Participants in the China program didn’t engage in academic research that could be the subject of espionage, she said.
“They’re highly vetted and they’re very established partnerships,” Mason said. “The geopolitical environment has changed in 30 years. I appreciate the question.”
Turk said nobody on the House committee was questioning the commitment at FHSU to guarantee security of the program with China. He told Mason it was impossible to predict how international relationships could unfold years from now.
“I don’t mean to beat you up about this China thing,” he said. “The nature of my question is simply how to plan for the worst. We wouldn’t be doing our job if we weren’t projecting, as budget members, into the future.”
The House committee also heard budget presentations from representatives of the Behavioral Sciences Regulatory Board, Kansas State Board of Healing Arts, Kansas State Historical Society and Kansas State Library.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/thomas-Newsom-psu-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

Democrat Mike Scott announced his candidacy for Maine Senate District 20, which includes Auburn, Durham, New Gloucester and Poland, on Wednesday. He plans to retire from the Auburn Fire Department in February after 30 years of service. 
“I’m not a career politician; I come from a background of showing up early, working hard, and getting the job done,” Scott said, in a news release. “I’m running for the State Senate to make life better for retirees, families, and workers by keeping costs down, making sure people can access quality healthcare, and supporting the people who keep our communities running.”
The seat is currently held by Republican Bruce Bickford, who is in his first term in the upper chamber but served multiple terms in the Maine House of Representatives.
Scott has served as president of the Professional Firefighters of Maine and has been an advocate for fair labor practices and the well-being of his colleagues. 
As a fellow union member and District 20 resident, state Rep. Kilton Webb (D-Durham) voiced his support for Scott. He said the area “will be well served by his steady leadership and dutiful approach.”

(Photo provided by Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities)Future assessments of U.S. landslide hazards could include the study of risks posed by atmospheric rivers, which caused extreme precipitation that was linked to recent deadly slides in Southeast Alaska.
The added focus on atmospheric rivers is one of the main updates in a bill that would reauthorize the National Landslide Preparedness Act. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, passed the U.S. Senate on Monday and is now to be considered by the U.S. House.
The initial National Landslide Preparedness Act was signed into law five years ago. That bill broadened the National Landslide Hazards Program led by the U.S. Geological Survey and established a multiagency system to coordinate landslide preparedness and response.
Atmospheric rivers are long and transitory bands of moisture and heat, likened to rivers in the sky. They carry that moisture northward from more southern latitudes, and they can dump vast amounts of rain for several hours or even days.
“You can very rapidly saturate soils in the right conditions,” said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
When such large amounts of warm southern moisture hit the steep mountainous regions of Southeast Alaska, they can cause sudden downhill flows, Thoman said.
“It’s really that intense amount of rain that atmospheric rivers deliver that’s the link to landslides,” he said.
Numerous landslides in the United States have been triggered by atmospheric rivers’ extreme precipitation. Those events include the 2023 slide in Wrangell that killed six people, the 2020 slide in Haines that killed two people and the 2015 slide in Sitka that killed three people.
The National Landslide Preparedness Act Reauthorization Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It is co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, whose state was the site of the 2014 Oso landslide that killed 43 people.
Extreme precipitation events from atmospheric rivers are tied to shallow-seated landslides such as the deadly events that struck Southeast Alaska in recent years. Other types of Alaska landslides are caused by more deep-seated slope failures triggered by glacial retreat, permafrost thaw or a combination of those forces.
Also passed on Monday by unanimous consent in the Senate was another Murkowski-sponsored and disaster-focused bill, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act. That bill, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, supports the federal program that maintains earthquake measurement resources and equipment and equipment and early warning systems.
“Earthquakes and landslides are active threats that have taken lives and damaged property across Alaska in recent years,” Murkowski said in a statement issued Tuesday. “Our passage of these bills puts us on track to ensure that federal agencies have the resources they need to help keep communities safe both back home and around the country. I thank my colleagues for working cooperatively to pass these measures and urge the House to take them up and send them to the President as soon as possible.”

One year ago today, the Palisades and Eaton wildfires erupted in Los Angeles County. Together they burned more than 58 square miles of land — destroying over 16,000 structures, displacing thousands of households and claiming at least 31 lives. As one of the costliest wildfires in history, the estimated economic losses caused by the blazes range from $65 billion to as much as $275 billion.
Most residents are still struggling to put their lives together: A survey by the nonprofit group Department of Angels found that about 90% of Pacific Palisades residents and 80% of Altadena residents remain displaced as of October. 
Survivors also continue to face frustrations with insurance companies — including delayed or denied claims — underscoring how California’s property insurance market remains rife with problems, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay. 
Premiums are likely to rise for policyholders across the state, and customers of California’s two largest insurers, State Farm and the last-resort FAIR Plan, were the most dissatisfied with their insurers’ response, according to the Department of Angels.

Angela Giacchetti, a spokesperson for the nonprofit whose Altadena home was damaged by the Eaton Fire: “We’ve paid almost $200,000 out of pocket to repair our home because of the FAIR Plan’s blanket denials of our remediation.”

But there have been some wins. California passed a law last year requiring insurers to pay claims without first seeing detailed inventories from policyholders. On Tuesday Gov. Gavin Newsom also issued an executive order expanding price gouging protections for people recovering from the fires. 
Permits for new homes in the affected regions have also been issued at a relatively fast clip compared to historic state standards, reports CalMatters’ Ben Christopher. As of this week, more than 2,600 residential permits have been distributed — a rate that’s “three times faster” than the five years leading up to the fires, Newsom’s administration noted.

After being rushed to a Chico hospital the night before, U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa died on Tuesday at the age of 65. For more than a decade the Republican represented California’s 1st Congressional District, which stretches from the Oregon-California border through Shasta and Sutter counties, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
LaMalfa died in emergency surgery after experiencing a “medical emergency” in his home, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Lamalfa was known as a pragmatic congressmember who was committed to issues affecting his rural Northern California district, including water access and forestry management.
His death narrows the GOP’s slim majority in the House, which now stands at 218. By state law, Gov. Newsom has 14 days to call a special election to fill the rest of LaMalfa’s term, which will take place under the existing district boundaries, rather than the new lines voters approved of through Proposition 50.

Limón starts as Pro Tem

Seven months after being elected Senate President Pro Tem in June, Democratic Sen. Monique Limón of Santa Barbara begins her tenure as leader of the California Senate — the first Latina ever to do so, reports Maya.
Backed by labor unions, the 46-year-old progressive’s career in the chamber includes successfully pushing legislation to make workers’ pay more transparent, shield medical debt from credit reports and require setbacks around new oil and gas wells. Prior to that, Limón was an Assemblymember for four years, and served on the board of trustees for the Santa Barbara Unified School District for six years.
As Senate Pro Tem, Limón faces the state’s $18 billion budget deficit and deep federal cuts under President Donald Trump. Though she did not disclose many details about how she’ll steer the caucus through budget talks, she told CalMatters that the caucus “will continue to prioritize issues that our communities prioritize.” She also declined to identify any specific legislative measures that the caucus would prioritize.

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office released a report Tuesday, examining whether the funding formula for California’s K-12 schools should switch from attendance to enrollment, which could bring billions of more dollars to schools. Read what the LAO recommends from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Critics of Newsom and California Democrats are making an iffy link between a state audit on fraud and a scandal in Minnesota, highlighting the amped-up rhetoric during an election year.
The California Department of Insurance is too lax regulating insurance companies’ behavior, yet too strict controlling their market access, writes Patrick Wolff, a Democrat who is running for insurance commissioner.
Local and state governments failed to lead within months of the L.A.-area fires, and candidates now running for various L.A. offices must present serious plans to address these failures, writes Max Lubin, CEO of Kismet Research.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-07 13:39:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,83 witnesses could enter the ring in Mississippi welfare scandal trial,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/83-witnesses-mississippi-welfare-scandal-trial/,The federal courthouse in Jackson,"Ten of roughly 80 potential jurors raised their hands in a downtown Jackson courtroom Tuesday when a federal judge asked: “How many professional wrestling fans do we have in here?”
Juror #4 stood and responded to U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves, “You wanna ask my favorite or something?”
It was John Cena, a WWE star of the mid-2000s t0 2010s.
“You’re a youngster,” Reeves joked.
Others were fond of The Undertaker, The Spoiler, or Bruiser and Crusher – performers dating back to as early as the 60s. But nearly all called themselves “former” fans of the sport. They watched no longer. “Too bloody and too violent,” Juror #19 mused.
None of these answers were necessarily disqualifying since each of the participants vowed that their affinity – or lack thereof – for athletic theater would not affect their impartiality as a juror in the criminal trial of retired WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr.
Jury selection in the trial began Tuesday morning and lasted until after 7 p.m. The federal government will begin presenting its case against DiBiase Wednesday morning. 
DiBiase is accused of conspiracy, wire fraud, theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and money laundering surrounding payments two nonprofits made to him in 2018 at the direction of the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
The money he’s accused of taking came from two federal public assistance programs, including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant.
The charges against DiBiase represent just a fraction of what is known as the Mississippi welfare scandal, in which auditors have questioned the spending of roughly $100 million in anti-poverty funds. But he is the only criminal defendant to challenge the government, insisting he was a lawful contractor. Seven others, including his brother Brett DiBiase, have pleaded guilty.
During the proceedings Tuesday, jurors were asked if they had heard anything about the welfare scandal in the news or on social media – around half said yes – or if they had read State Auditor Shad White’s supposed tell-all, “Mississippi Swindle,” about the case. None had.
“I heard about the book, but I care nothing about reading it,” Juror #66 said. “I don’t want to read anything he writes.”
But when Reeves asked if anyone in the courtroom believed everything TV stations or newspapers had to say about the scandal, the room went silent. Like with their WWE nostalgia, the jurors promised that any information they’d consumed previously would not sway their judgement.
Perhaps the most revelatory inquiry came when Reeves asked the jurors if they had a relationship with any of the potential witnesses in the case, reading out a list of a whopping 83 names.
The list predictably included characters with direct involvement in the financial transactions alleged in the indictment against DiBiase – such as the former welfare director John Davis or the directors of the two nonprofits that paid funds to the wrestler, Mississippi Community Education Center founder Nancy New and former Family Resource Center of North Mississippi director Christi Webb. Davis, New and Webb have pleaded guilty for their roles in the larger scheme to divert funding away from needy families. 
But the list of witnesses goes much further, reaching high up into state government, including both White, who first investigated and made initial arrests in the case, and former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. Bryant was Davis’ boss during the scandal. And Bryant appointed White to his position of state auditor.
From the Mississippi Department of Human Services, the witness list includes the agency’s top official, current director Bob Anderson, former director Chris Freeze, and roughly 20 cabinet or lower-ranking employees, such as former attorneys Jacob Black and William Garrig Shields, two former communications directors, and Davis’ old secretary. It includes members of the team that audited or investigated the scandal for the State Auditor’s Office, the lead FBI agent and a representative from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General.
The list also features a director at the regional office of HHS’s Administration for Children and Families in Atlanta, the agency responsible for providing federal guidance to Mississippi about TANF. 
Potential witnesses include DiBiase’s inner circle – his wife, his brother, multiple business associates and fellow motivational speakers – but also a who’s who of local celebrities and entrepreneurs that had become entangled in the wider state-sanctioned welfare delivery model called Families First for Mississippi from 2016 to 2020. 
One seemingly tangential witness, retired star running back Marcus Dupree, for example, received payments from the two nonprofits through a foundation he created to provide “equestrian activities for underprivileged children.” The witness list did not include former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. 
The trial is expected to take up to three weeks, and not all of the listed figures may be called.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07092145/courthouse_jackson.jpg,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

Last January, immediately after the fires, there was a moment of optimism for the future of Los Angeles. Fire survivors, policymakers, philanthropists, CEOs and regular Angelenos came together to plan Los Angeles’ recovery. 
But today, 12 months later, the failed leadership of California politicians has set back recovery efforts. 
I am a born and raised Angeleno, and like so many others after the fires, I wanted to help. My career leading mission-driven work led me to connect with Evan Spiegel, founder of Snapchat, and Miguel Santana, president of the California Community Foundation. They launched the Department of Angels, a nonprofit that supports LA wildfire survivors, elevating their leadership in the recovery process. 
Today the group is one of many organizations dedicated to the recovery effort. But community-driven work can only accomplish so much. Recovery efforts for disasters of this scale require the government to lead. 
Signs of the government’s systemic failure to lead began emerging within months of the fires. Away from Los Angeles when the fires first ignited — on an international trip she had pledged not to take — Mayor Karen Bass began the recovery effort behind the 8-ball and has seemingly never recovered. She has openly feuded with critics of her performance, including the Palisades Fire recovery czar that she herself appointed. 
At the county level, the board of supervisors still has not fixed the county’s broken emergency notification system, a failure that likely contributed to many of the 19 deaths in the Eaton Fire.
And at the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom jockeyed to be the central figure in the campaign for federal funding, but his rivalry with President Donald Trump has doomed the possibility of federal aid for Los Angeles. 
The consequences have been devastating for survivors. 
Today, more than 8 in 10 Altadena residents and 9 in 10 Palisades residents are still out of their homes. Thousands of houses that survived the flames remain unsafe or uninhabitable because of contamination. And only about 15% of the 10,000-plus destroyed homes have received rebuilding permits from LA city or county. 
In other words, a year later, the rebuilding process has barely begun.
Perhaps worst of all, no concrete steps have been taken to prevent future wildfires in the Los Angeles area, where conflagrations are all but guaranteed.  If nothing changes about the government’s approach, most survivors of January’s fires will never return to their neighborhoods, and future fires will claim even more lives, homes and businesses. 
Despite the gravity of these challenges, there are reasons for optimism. This year Californians have the opportunity to elect officials who can plot a better way forward, including a new governor and statewide insurance commissioner. 
In Los Angeles, we will have elections for county supervisors, City Council, Congress, mayor and more. 
What are candidates’ plans for fire recovery?
The myriad candidates in the running need to present serious plans to address the failures of the first year of recovery. They must communicate clear ideas to address environmental toxins that remain, failed emergency response systems, future wildfire prevention and the painfully slow pace of permitting and rebuilding — among many other related issues. 
Philanthropy can play a role, too, by organizing nonpartisan candidate forums for candidates to hear from survivors directly. In the first year of the fire recovery, LA’s robust institutional philanthropies tried to help elected leaders behind the scenes. Looking ahead, philanthropies would be better served backing the public accountability work necessary for politicians to deliver on their promises. 
The failures of the first year of wildfire recovery rests at the feet of politicians, but that does not mean that the many years of recovery work ahead are doomed. Survivors and regular Angelenos have the chance to hold elected officials accountable for their shortcomings and elect new ones who are up to the job. 
L.A. fire survivors deserve a new set of leaders who’ll have the courage to act and the solutions to rebuild Los Angeles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042325-Altadena-Recovery-MT-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C707&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

A tough budget year will test her ability to keep the caucus united while whittling its spending priorities.","In summary
New Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón is the first Latina, first mother and only second woman to lead California’s upper legislative chamber. A tough budget year will test her ability to keep the caucus united while whittling its spending priorities.


As California legislators return to Sacramento and prepare to tackle a budget deficit, all eyes are on new Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón of Santa Barbara and what tone she sets for her chamber.
Limón, 46, a progressive backed by labor unions and the first Latina to lead the Senate, will face arguably her greatest legislative challenge yet as she and her diverse caucus grapple with a daunting projected $18 billion state budget deficit and historic federal funding cuts from the Trump administration.
While Limón has yet to announce any cost-cutting strategies or impose any limits on lawmakers introducing bills that require new money, the scarcity of funds will likely force the new leader to focus on a few key priorities, a premise she resisted in a recent interview with CalMatters. 
“Our caucus will continue to prioritize issues that our communities prioritize,” Limón said, rattling off a laundry list of policy areas including access to health care, cost of living, education, housing affordability and child care. The new Senate leader also emphasized the importance of finding policy solutions that are “encompassing of our caucus — that reflect 58 counties, 483 cities.” 
But how she’ll do that, while keeping the budget under control, remains to be seen.
For Limón, who has developed a reputation as an egalitarian consensus builder who wants everyone to feel heard, whittling down those priorities will test her ability to say “no” as the caucus tries to both rein in spending and fund programs that help vulnerable Californians. 
She told reporters at the Capitol on Monday that she expects senators to understand that “spending big is not something that is within our means at this moment” and said she would reiterate that message at their first caucus meeting.
Colleagues past and present give her their vote of confidence to lead the chamber through a difficult budget year.
“She’s a good person to have in place when there’s a challenge,” said Kate Parker, who served alongside Limón on the Santa Barbara school board, including as president. “Obviously the budget is going to be horrendous, and she’s somebody that I would really trust to move the state forward in a really difficult time.”
From school board to Senate leader
Limón points to her nine-year tenure in the Legislature and relationships with legislative colleagues as the foundation for her inevitably tough conversations about how to prioritize a mountain of pressing issues.
The new Senate leader is best known for pursuing pay transparency legislation, consumer protections such as shielding medical debt from credit reports, and efforts to regulate the oil industry. She authored a 2022 law that requires setbacks around new oil and gas wells and steps to protect residents who live near old wells, and pushed for an unsuccessful 2021 bill to ban oil fracking. Gov. Gavin Newsom later ordered the ban.

In the Assembly she chaired the Banking and Finance committee and until recently led the Senate committee on natural resources and water. Under two former Senate leaders, Toni Atkins and Mike McGuire, Limón was second-in-command as majority leader for Senate Democrats and helped craft legislative strategy. 
Limón was elected pro tem in June after joining forces with supporters of Sen. Angelique Ashby, a Sacramento Democrat also seeking the role, to amass a majority of the caucus and shut down a competing bid from Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach. The power jockeying came amid a chaotic week as a federal standoff over immigration enforcement exploded in Los Angeles and the Legislature scrambled to finalize a budget. Limón has since named Ashby as her majority leader.
Prior to running for the Legislature, Limón served six years on the board of trustees for the Santa Barbara Unified School District, the public school system she attended before she immersed herself in public service and policy studies at UC Berkeley and later, graduated from Columbia University with a master’s degree in education. 
Her first election for public office came in 2009 when Limón ran for an open spot on the Santa Barbara school board. Former board president Kate Parker, who overlapped with Limón during the now-senator’s six-year tenure, said she had never heard of Limón before the election and was even a bit skeptical about her leadership ability. 
“It was kind of out of left field that she was running, and she didn’t have a kid in the district,” said Parker. “She seemed so young to me at the time. You know, I think she was probably like 30 or something. And I just wasn’t sure if she had the experience to be a strong leader in the district.”
But from their first meeting, Limón impressed Parker with her ability to listen to all sides and draw consensus from a group with a wide range of opinions. 
“She was really good at crafting productive compromise,” Parker said. “She had a policy of meeting with anybody that wanted to talk to her.”
Limón has been tight-lipped about how she’ll steer the caucus through budget negotiations. But Parker said Limón is no stranger to difficult spending discussions. Nearly every year they served together, the school board faced budget challenges. 
“Her guiding principle, in that context, was always putting the student first,” Parker said, adding that Limón always tried to keep funding cuts as far away from the classroom as possible.

“I imagine that at the state level, you’ll find that she has guiding principles as well that help with her decision-making process,” Parker said. “It’s not random, it’s not piece by piece. It’s systematic.”
Limón has yet to divulge precisely what those guiding principles will be for the Senate under her leadership. In an interview with CalMatters, she declined to identify any specific legislative measures that the caucus would prioritize. 
But she hasn’t ruled anything out, either. When asked specifically whether her caucus should consider raising taxes or cutting state services, Limón didn’t reject either idea, both considered politically radioactive options.
“Everything’s on the table until we choose, or make a decision that it shouldn’t be on the table,” Limón said. “But having a deliberative and thoughtful conversation about the options in front of us doesn’t mean that we necessarily move forward with all options. It just means that you consider them.”
No bad blood with McGuire
Limón’s reputation as a collaborator and consensus builder contrasts starkly with that of her predecessor, McGuire, who some members, staff and lobbyists have privately called a micromanager.
During last year’s eleventh-hour negotiations over reauthorizing the state’s cap-and-trade program, McGuire reportedly kept the Senate’s draft bill language under lock and key and refused to let members take copies with them to review with staff, instead requiring them to come in person to view the text and banning photos. Advocates said they felt iced out of discussions and had little to no opportunity to give input. 
“We are hopeful that this change in leadership means the beginning of a new and more transparent process,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager for the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.
Frustrations boiled over in a September budget subcommittee hearing when lawmakers debated a budget bill that contained more than $85 million in earmarks for projects in McGuire’s northern coastal district. That power play prompted Democratic Napa Sen. Chris Cabaldon to quip in front of the whole committee, “There are more than just a handful of disadvantaged communities, plus the North Coast, in California.”
Limón has tried to tamp down any criticism of her predecessor.

“There was never a moment that this was a comparison of leadership,” Limón insisted. “At the end of the day, this is really about what the caucus wants, the direction the caucus wants to go, the experiences that the caucus feels are needed at this moment in time.”
Limón led the Senate’s working group on the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program, a fight at the heart of negotiations on a climate and energy policy deal that dragged out the final days of last year’s legislative session. 
Her greatest challenge, said Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat and fellow member of the working group who she has named as her budget chair, was bridging the gaps between members who wanted to maintain the existing cap-and-trade program largely as-is and the climate hawks, who wanted to ditch some of the concessions former Gov. Jerry Brown gave to polluting industries to win votes during the last reauthorization.
“That was a real test because that was like riding a f-ing bronco,” Laird said. “And yet she worked hard to hold the Senate together. She worked hard to understand what individuals really wanted. And a lot of what we desired was part of the final results because of her work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

Despite billions in dollars of claims paid out, fires exposed problems in California’s beleaguered insurance market. All policyholders are likely to see premiums rise.


A year after the deadly Los Angeles County fires, California’s property insurance market remains problematic; survivors are suing insurers over delayed or denied claims; and most of the state’s policyholders are likely to see their premiums rise.
Seven in 10 L.A. fire survivors have yet to return home, some in part because of insurance claim delays, according to a new survey released this week by Department of Angels, a nonprofit group that was formed after the fires.
The survey also found that 4 in 10 insurance policyholders have experienced insurability issues, such as huge premium increases and dropped coverage, although state law mandates a one-year moratorium on insurers canceling or not renewing customers’ policies after the governor declares a state of emergency. Those with homes that did not burn down but are still standing are especially likely to have seen big increases in their premiums, according to the survey of 2,443 adults from Nov. 18 to Dec. 2, 2025.
Insurance premiums for everyone, not just fire survivors, were already expected to rise under new rules by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The commissioner, under pressure to improve availability of insurance in the state, last January implemented a plan that aims for quicker rate reviews and allows insurers to use catastrophe modeling and reinsurance costs in setting their rates. The plan took effect just days before the L.A. fires.
Now the response to the fires could also lead to even higher insurance premiums across the board, said Amy Bach, executive director of consumer advocacy group United Policyholders. 
“I advocate for disaster survivors, but also for the entire community of policyholders,” Bach said. “For every ‘Eliminate the List’ bill, for every improvement we make to prevent post-disaster trauma around under-insurance, there’s a cost.” She said such actions will have ramifications for both insurance affordability and availability.
“Eliminate the List,” which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law last year, requires insurance companies to pay 60% of personal property coverage limits, up to $350,000, to policyholders who experience a total loss without requiring them to submit a detailed inventory for at least 100 days.
Still, Bach knows that such mandates are necessary to improve survivors’ experiences after a fire, and lawmakers are introducing new bills to address their concerns. Her own group released a survey in November, reporting policyholder complaints that included insurer communication delays, claims payment delays and being assigned multiple claims adjusters. 
The Department of Angels survey found that customers of State Farm and the last-resort FAIR Plan — the two largest insurers in California — were the most dissatisfied with their insurers’ response. California’s insurance department is investigating State Farm’s response to the fires, and has taken legal action against the FAIR Plan over its response as well, especially to smoke-damage claims. Those insurers, along with other companies, are also facing policyholder lawsuits. 
“Our customer feedback reflects a different experience than what is being reported,” said Tom Hartmann, a State Farm spokesperson, in an email. “We’re supporting more than 13,500 customers affected by the wildfires, more than any other carrier, and have already paid over $5 billion to help them recover.”

“We’ve paid almost $200,000 out of pocket to repair our home because of the FAIR Plan’s blanket denials of our remediation,” said Angela Giacchetti, a spokesperson for the Department of Angels who worked on the survey. She’s also a fire survivor whose Altadena home did not burn down but was badly damaged. 
“While we are unable to comment on individual policyholders’ claims, the California FAIR Plan does not direct where policyholders reside,” said Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the plan. “The FAIR Plan evaluates every claim on its own merits and pays all covered claims up to the individual policy limits.”  
The FAIR Plan said in a press release this week that it has handled about 5,400 claims and paid almost $3.5 billion to policyholders. It also said it “has taken steps to enhance its ability to serve policyholders” by securing a line of credit and reinsurance, helped by a $750 million catastrophe bond made possible by a new law allowing the FAIR Plan to get bond financing through the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank.
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association says insurance companies have paid $22.4 billion of the expected $40 billion in total claims from the L.A. fires. 
The Department of Angels survey also found 79% of survivors are facing financial hardships, with more Black, Asian and Latino survivors falling behind on their rent or mortgage payments. In addition, 40% of those surveyed said they were very dissatisfied with the local, state and federal response to their needs.
Newsom said Tuesday that he is working with state lawmakers, the banking industry and others on new loans for rebuilding, and that the state will expand eligibility for the CalAssist Mortgage Fund. The governor’s office did not respond to CalMatters’ questions about whether he plans to propose any aid for renters who survived the fires, and about what else he is doing to continue to press the federal government for long-term disaster funding.
“This report says exactly what we’ve been hearing,” said Michael Soller, spokesperson for the insurance department. “Wildfire survivors want action and they want results.” He said the issues in the survey are top priorities for the department, and among other things pointed to a task force on smoke damage that the department has convened.
A bill sponsored by Lara and introduced by newly appointed Senate Insurance Committee Chair Steve Padilla, the Democrat from San Diego, late Tuesday would require insurance companies to submit to the state their disaster-recovery plans related to handling claims; double penalties for violations of fair claims practices during an emergency; expand upfront claims payments; give policyholders status updates within five days whenever their adjuster is replaced; and more.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/021425_EatonFireMudslides_JAJ_CM_23.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

While few victims of last year’s fires are back in their homes, that’s not unusual following natural disasters; permitting changes appear to be helping. 


In the days immediately after last January’s Los Angeles firestorm, state lawmakers and civic leaders promised to turbocharge the rebuilding effort. For California, where the permitting and construction of homes is infamously slow and costly, the scale of destruction stood as a singular challenge.
A year later, the charred homes, the melted appliances and the toxic ash have mostly been removed, the dirt beneath scraped and then carted away. Many of the residents whose houses were spared have returned. Permits for reconstruction have been filed, architects and contractors hired. Battles with insurance companies, utilities and banks persist, vacant lots and blackened trees abound, but look around and — here and there — you’ll find new construction.
As of this week, more than 2,600 residential permits have been issued between the Palisades and Altadena — roughly one for every five of the nearly 13,000 homes lost. Another 3,340 are under review.
For many displaced and traumatized homeowners, that represents an intolerably slow return to what was. But by historic standards, the Los Angeles recovery has been on the speedy side so far.
In a press release commemorating the first anniversary of the disaster, Gov. Gavin Newsom lauded the permitting figures as “historic.”
Last year local governments — the City and County of Los Angeles, as well as Malibu and Pasadena — issued permits for single-family homes and accessory dwelling units “three times faster” than they were in the five years leading up to the fire, the administration noted. 
Rebuilding after disaster is almost always a grueling, slow process. Of the more than 22,500 homes destroyed in five of California’s most destructive fires between 2017 and 2020, fewer than four-in-ten had been rebuilt by 2025, a Los Angeles Times analysis from late last summer found.
A year after major fires ripped through Maui, Paradise, Redding and the outskirts of Boulder, Colo., 2%, 3%, 15% and 30% of the destroyed homes, respectively, had been permitted for reconstruction, according to a separate Urban Institute analysis. 
 Based on the pace of permitting, Los Angeles’ reconstruction is on a relatively fast track. But freshly-pulled permits aren’t completed homes.
“People can pull permits, but you know, if they don’t have their costs sorted out — we’ve had folks abandon their plans,” said Devang Shah with Genesis Builders, which is selling pre-approved, fixed-priced rebuilds in Altadena. Using permits as a metric of progress may be premature, he said.
Some of the speedy progress that Los Angeles has seen may be due to  regulatory changes imposed by fiat in the aftermath of the fire. In early 2025, both Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass mandated speedier permitting of like-for-like rebuilds — construction that stuck to the rough dimensions and design specification of the home that was there before. Los Angeles county rolled out a self-certification building plan approval pilot program for certain simple projects. Newsom waived building code requirements intended to ease the cost of reconstruction.
“We’ve got planning approvals in three days that would have normally taken three months,” said Tim Vordtriede, an architect who also lost his home in Altadena. The county has “done a remarkable job at making things as efficient and streamlined as a bureaucratic entity can.”
In the weeks after the fire, Vordtriede co-founded the Altadena Collective, a network of designers and architects that provides discounted design services, permitting advice and contractor recommendations to local survivors. He and his co-founders Chris Driscoll and Chris Corbett have also launched a nonprofit called Collective OR that is meant to represent inexperienced and anxious homeowners in negotiations with builders and architects. 
“It’s impossible to say, ‘they were here by this date so we should also be there.’ The data set is just too variable.”Colette Curtis, recovery and economic development director, Paradise 
The pace of reconstruction may simply benefit from the fact that it’s taking place in Los Angeles County: A mammoth economic hub flush with financial resources and political connections.
“We have access to a really good supply chain, there’s a lot of capital, there’s a lot of infrastructure,“ said Ben Stapleton, director of U.S. Green Building Council California. 
That’s in contrast to a town like Paradise. 
Since the majority of homes were destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire, fewer than one-in-five have since been rebuilt, said Colette Curtis, the Butte County town’s recovery and economic development director. 
She cautioned against comparing the pace of rebuilding efforts across communities struck by disaster.
“It’s impossible to say, ‘they were here by this date so we should also be there,’” she said. “The data set is just too variable.”
Paradise, a remote town with relatively low income, lacked the local services and philanthropic draw of places like Lahaina and the Palisades, she said. But lower land values and the fact that displaced homeowners haven’t had to compete with investors setting aside new units for tourist rentals was a net positive. 
Another thing that may give Los Angeles a leg up: It’s a region that’s also heavy on expertise. 
At around the same time that Vordtriede was setting up the Altadena Collective, nearby architect couple Cynthia Sigler and Alex Athenson launched the Foothill Catalog, a packet of ready-made architectural and structural plans that have been pre-approved by L.A. County. 
With roughly 15 projects either under construction or gearing up to break ground, Athenson said the pre-approval process can shave at least 10% off the total development cost of a custom single-family home.
That’s in part by trimming the approval process. But that’s also because prior to the fire, a “custom single-family home” in ALtadena was a luxury product. 
The local industry is “set up to serve that client who is building their dream home from scratch, with a very large if not unlimited budget,” said Athenson. Long-time homeowners displaced by fire, many of them on fixed incomes, represent a very different kind of buyer. 
As builders, designers and policymakers scramble to rebuild in faster, cheaper and more fire-resilient ways, they may stumble upon a solution that could be of use long after the last home is rebuilt in Altadena, he added.
“Ultimately, we’re providing a system for more efficient, affordable housing development,” said Athenson. “I’m excited about proving it in Altadena, and then seeing where it goes beyond.”
So far the county has approved more than two dozen of the catalog’s plans. Athenson said they are now discussing rolling out a similar batch for the Palisades with the City of Los Angeles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/083025-Palisades-Fire-Rebuild-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

Here’s the tradeoff,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2026/01/school-enrollment-california/,"By basing funding on enrollment, not attendance numbers, schools would lose the incentive to get students to show up every day, a new report finds.","In summary
By basing funding on enrollment, not attendance numbers, schools would lose the incentive to get students to show up every day, a new report finds.


For years, California schools have pushed to change the way the state pays for K-12 education: by basing funding on enrollment, instead of attendance. That’s the way 45 other states do it, and it would mean an extra $6 billion annually in school coffers.
But such a move might cause more harm than good in the long run, because linking funding to enrollment means schools have little incentive to lure students to class every day, according to a report released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. Without that incentive, attendance would drop, and students would suffer. 
If the Legislature wants to boost school funding, analysts argued, it should use the existing attendance-based model and funnel more money to schools with high numbers of low-income students, students in foster care and English learners.
When it comes to attendance, money talks, the report noted. For more than a century, California has funded schools based on average daily attendance – how many students show up every day. In the 1980s and ’90s, the state started to look at alternatives. A pilot study from that time period showed that attendance at high schools rose 5.4% and attendance at elementary schools rose 3.1% when those schools had a financial incentive to boost attendance. 
This is not the time to ease up on attendance matters, the report said. Although attendance has improved somewhat since campuses closed during the pandemic, it remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels. In 2019, nearly 96% of students showed up to school every day. The number dropped to about 90% during COVID-19, when most schools switched to remote learning, but still remains about 2 percentage points below its previous high. 
Attendance is tied to a host of student success measurements. Students with strong attendance tend to have higher test scores, higher levels of reading proficiency and higher graduation rates.
“It’s a thoughtful analysis that weighs the pros and cons,” said Hedy Chang, president of the nonprofit research and advocacy organization Attendance Works. “For some districts there might be benefits to a funding switch, but it also helps when districts have a concrete incentive for encouraging kids to show up.”
True cost of educating kids
Schools have long asked the Legislature to change the funding formula, which they say doesn’t cover the actual costs of educating students, especially those with high needs. The issue came up repeatedly at a recent conference of the California School Boards Association, and there’s been at least one recent bill that addressed the issue.
The bill, by former Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat from the La Cañada Flintridge area, initially called for a change to the funding formula, but the final version merely asked the Legislative Analyst’s Office to study the issue. The bill passed in 2024.
A 2022 report by Policy Analysis for California Education also noted the risks of removing schools’ financial incentive to prioritize attendance. But it also said that increasing school funding overall would give districts more stability.
Enrollment is a better funding metric because schools have to plan for the number of students who sign up, not the number who show up, said Troy Flint, spokesman for the California School Boards Association. 
He also noted that schools with higher rates of absenteeism also tend to have higher numbers of students who need extra help, such as English learners, migrant students and low-income students. Tying funding to daily attendance — which in some districts is as low as 60% — brings less money to those schools, ultimately hurting the students who need the most assistance, he said.  
“It just compounds the problem, creating a vicious cycle,” Flint said.
To really boost attendance, schools need extra funding to serve those students.
Switching to an enrollment-based funding model would increase K-12 funding by more than $6 billion, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. Currently, schools receive about $15,000 annually per student through the state’s main funding mechanism, the Local Control Funding Formula, with an additional $7,000 coming from the federal government, block grants, lottery money, special education funds and other sources. Overall, California spent more than $100 billion on schools last year, according to the Legislative Analyst.
Motivated by money?
Flint’s group also questioned whether schools are solely motivated by money to entice students to class.
“Most people in education desperately want kids in class every day,” Flint said. “These are some of the most dedicated, motivated people I’ve met, and they care greatly about students’ welfare.”
Josh Schultz, superintendent of the Napa County Office of Education, agreed. Napa schools that are funded through attendance actually have lower attendance than schools that are considered “basic aid,” and funded through local property taxes. Both types of schools have high numbers of English learners and migrant students.
“I can understand the logic (of the LAO’s assertion) but I don’t know if it bears out in reality, at least here,” Schultz said. “Both kinds of schools see great value in having kids show up to school every day.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030122_High_School_1297_SW_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)State school trust lands officials announced this week that Utah public schools will get a record $134 million distribution from trust land investments in the 2026-2027 school year. 
That marks a 20% bump from last year’s previous record of $111.3 million. 
The increased distribution from the state’s longstanding trust lands system “reflects strong financial performance from trust land management” and the Permanent State School Fund’s investment portfolio, the Utah Land Trusts Protections & Advocacy Office said in a news release Monday. 
The jump also reflects the first year of additional money after Utah voters in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment, Amendment B, which increased how much can be distributed each year from the Permanent State School Fund, an endowment created at statehood to support public schools. Amendment B increased the limit of the annual distributions from 4% to 5% of the fund. 
Utah officials celebrate back to school with a record $111.3M from land investments

Had voters not passed Amendment B, schools this year would have received about $118 million during the 2026-2027 school year — meaning the 1 percentage point higher distribution cap allowed $16 million more to be distributed to schools this year. 
“This marks a significant milestone for Utah’s Trust System and the growing impact on all trust beneficiaries,” Kim Christy, director of the Land Trusts Protection and Advocacy Office, said in a prepared statement. “The Trust Lands Administration and (the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office) are doing great things to uphold trust principles and sustain maximum performance of the trust assets.”
Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks, who chairs the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office board, also issued a statement applauding the record-breaking distribution. 
“Utah students benefit from a trust system that delivers strong results and protects both current and future beneficiaries,” Oaks said. “Careful land management and prudent investment decisions strengthen schools today and preserve the fund for generations to come.”
 School trust funds are generated from trust lands that were granted to Utah at statehood to support public education and other state institutions. The vast majority of the funds benefit school children, but other trust beneficiaries including higher education and other designated state institutions will also receive higher allocations. 
The revenue is generated from leases, sales and development of trust lands then deposited into the Permanent State School Fund. Since 1994, Utah’s combined permanent funds have grown from $50 million to $4.1 billion, according to trust lands officials. 
 How much will schools get? 
Yearly distributions from the School LAND Trust program are made to every public school in the state based on a per-pupil formula. State trust lands officials said individual schools will be notified later this week about their specific allocations. 
However, on Monday state trust lands officials offered a sneak peak by sharing a breakdown of what school districts in Salt Lake County will receive:

Jordan School District will get $10.5 million
Granite School District will get $10.2 million 
Canyons School District will get $6 million
Salt Lake City School District will get $3.5 million
Murray School District will get $1.3 million

The Salt Lake County school district allocations total $31.5 million. The remaining $102.5 million of this year’s $134 million allocation will be distributed to other public schools across the state based on student population. 
The funds, according to state trust lands officials, “support academic intervention and innovation, help reduce class size, expand access to technology, and enhance professional development.”

Decisions on how each school will use the money are made by local school community council members and land trust councils. Every school has a council that determines its greatest academic need, subject to approval by the school’s local school board. 
“Utah’s School LAND Trust distributions are the best form of local control,” Rep. Tracy Miller, R-South Jordan. “Parents, teachers, and principals work together to decide how to best use these funds to improve student learning and meet the unique needs of every community.”
How does Utah’s school land trust system work?
Four agencies make up Utah’s School and Institutional Trust System. 
The Trust Lands Administration manages about 3.3 million acres of trust lands in Utah, granted by Congress at statehood in 1896 with the requirement that revenue earned from the sale or lease of the land be placed into permanent endowment for public schools. The revenue is generated from activities like energy development, real estate and grazing. 
The School LAND Trust program, housed in the State Board of Education, distributes annual investment earnings directly to local K-12 schools and empowers communities to decide how best to meet their needs through land trust councils that decide how to spend the money. 
The Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office is made up of an independent team of investors tasked with investing the revenue in the Permanent State School Fund to grow the endowment. And the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office is tasked with monitoring trust lands management to ensure returns are maximized while ensuring the fund’s beneficiaries’ interests are protected and represented.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) Alabama’s tax collections remain among the lowest in the nation, making it harder for local governments to fund education and other services, according to a recent report from the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA).
The report found that while Alabama’s overall tax collections grew in 2023, it was still near the bottom of the nation for collections, beaten only by Tennessee and Mississippi, which have cut taxes in recent years. 
Thomas Spencer, one of the authors of the report, said in an interview Tuesday centuries-old tax restrictions and poverty both played a role. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We have citizens that don’t have as much income, so higher rates of poverty in our state and so we have less wealth to tax,” he said.
The state also has the lowest property tax rate in the nation due to property tax caps first introduced in the 1875 Constitution and tightened in the 1901 Constitution, which took the vote away from Black Alabamians and poor whites. Collections were further limited by the lid bills in the 1970s, which capped property assessments. 
The report said that low property taxes help farmers, homeowners and timberland owners but makes it harder to fund education, public safety and health.
In fiscal year 2023, Alabama’s state and local governments collected over $4,900 per individual in taxes, including sales, property and income among other taxes. In comparison, the average total tax collected per individual for the southeastern states — where taxes are relatively low compared to the rest of the nation — was $5,198. 
The report noted that Arkansas, “a state with less wealth and economic activity than Alabama,” collected $354 more per person in taxes.
“If Alabama collected taxes at Arkansas’ rate, state and local governments would have an additional $1.8 billion in state dollars to fund education, health care, highways, public safety, and the broad spectrum of state and local services governments provide,” the report said.
In 2023, Mississippi began phasing out individual income taxes while Tennessee completely phased it out in the same year. Alabama’s income tax was established by constitutional amendment in 1933, an amendment that also included income tax thresholds and rates, with a top rate of 5% for married couples making $6,000 a year or more. While progressive for its time, the report notes that nearly a century of inflation means that they are “almost meaningless” today and subject low-income earners to the income tax.  
According to the report, nearly half of the revenue collected by Alabama’s local and state governments comes from sales taxes, in comparison to the rest of the nation where sales taxes make up one third of state and local taxes.
“We have a lot of constitutional protections built in that preclude local governments from raising taxes in above certain limits on property in particular, but there’s pretty much no restriction on sales tax, and so we have some of the highest sales tax rates in the country,” Spencer said.
Sales taxes are more costly to poorer residents, resulting in burdens on their earning power and less overall revenue. 
Alabama reduced the grocery tax from 3% to 2% last year. But this tax cut means less money for the Education Trust Fund, which is used to fund much of K-12 and higher education in the state.
“We’re going to have to keep an eye on our education funding to make sure it stays at a competitive level, so that we’re able to pay teachers and the other things that we’re continuing to do,” Spencer said.
Spencer also noted that the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that can be used for education based expenses, including private school tuition, could pose a threat to the Education Trust Fund budget later on.
“We’re basically funding it with surplus money from prior years.

The report reiterated concerns about seven situations, two of which have been on the list since 2007, including the bureaucracy’s chronic inability to successfully employ information technology — embarrassing for a state that is the global center for digital tools.
Parks has added a new program in his latest overview, the Department of Social Service’s food aid for poor families, once called food stamps but now known as CalFresh.
The federal government primarily finances supplemental food benefits, but the state’s share is determined, in part, by its management, as indicated by its rate of error when determining people’s eligibility.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tightens the error rate thresholds. Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”
The most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.
By happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.
Dozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.
Meanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.
This week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”
However, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.
Ro Khanna, a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Silicon Valley who could be a rival to Newsom in the 2028 presidential sweepstakes, issued a similar blast in a posting on X, albeit with a smaller $72 billion pricetag, citing Parks’ report and other data.
Khanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”
Newsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”

Mark Jackson, executive director of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama (MASA), said in an interview Tuesday afternoon that the physician shortage has been an issue since the COVID-19 pandemic. He said retiring physicians and those leaving the profession due to burnout because of increased patient load are making the problem worse.
“It’s becoming more and more of a problem as things have transpired over the last few years. Hospitals are dealing with the same thing,” Jackson said. “We’ve got some ideas of things that can be done, but none of that has been implemented yet.”

The state will receive $203 million under the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA). The money is meant to partially offset cuts to Medicaid in the coming years. 
The state plans to distribute the money between 11 initiatives: Collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR), IT and Cybersecurity; Rural Health; Maternal and Fetal Health; Rural Workforce; Cancer Digital Regionalization; Simulation Training; Statewide EMS Trauma and Stroke; EMS Treat-In-Place; Mental Health; Community Medicine; and Rural Health Practice. 
The state has not said how it plans to distribute the federal money among the initiatives.
The federal program will distribute $50 billion to states over five years, half of which will be evenly distributed and the other half will be under the discretion of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Alabama received $3.4 million in addition to the guaranteed $200 million.
According to the United Health Foundation, Alabama in September 2024 had 241 primary care physicians per 100,000 people, ranking 45th in the United States.
“Regardless of the cause, the solution is clear: Alabama must train, recruit and retain more physicians,” Dr. Mark LeQuire, president of MASA, said in a statement. 
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open. 
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program. 
Jackson suggested using some of the money from the Rural Health Transformation Program for incentive programs to retain medical students in Alabama after they complete their residencies. 
“Those existing programs have been successful, but their success is fairly limited, because it’s been limited to the amount of money they’ve had to spend,” Jackson said. 
 LeQuire suggested the money be used to create state-funded residency programs, especially in primary care.
“Doctors are far more likely to practice where they complete their residency training,” he said. “By investing in residency programs, Alabama can grow its physician workforce, improve access to care and strengthen the quality of life in rural communities.”
Jackson said that most residency programs are federally-funded, but there are a few that are state-funded. According to Marco Villagrana, a congressional policy analyst, CMS spent $6.1 billion on direct Graduate Medical Education in fiscal year 2023 nationwide. Those costs include the resident’s roughly $55,000 salary and the hospital’s cost to educate them.
“If the state can use some of this money to create additional residency slots in the state, then your chances of being able to retain those physicians in the state greatly increase,” Jackson said.
Jackson also suggested using the money to invest in telehealth programs, which would make it easier for patients in rural Alabama to get care from doctors from larger hospitals.
“If we could have some money dedicated towards that, I think that’s a kind of a new idea that I think could be beneficial,” he said.
The money will be administered through the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), according to the Dec. 29 statement from Ivey’s office.

(UMC photo)A federally-funded pilot program conducted by Clark County found a crisis intervention team is effective in keeping people with substance abuse and mental health issues out of local emergency rooms and is likely a cost savings for University Medical Center, the county’s public hospital, Clark County Commissioners learned Tuesday.
Nationally, up to 31% of 911 calls involve a police department response to individuals with mental health issues, according to a report on the pilot program presented to commissioners Tuesday. 
Crisis Response Teams (CRTs) are often panned by those who conflate them with efforts to defund the police. Law enforcement officials, however, generally welcome CRTs and the opportunity they give police and fire emergency responders to return to other duties. 
During his 2023 campaign for governor, then-Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said people “don’t get the nuance” and observed that officers are often asked “to solve all these social problems by virtue of people dialing 911. We have to show up because we’re duty bound to show up but we’re not given the resources to address the issue and we can’t walk away. That’s the tragedy behind it. Our incarceration system is the largest mental health system in the state.” 
“So if they want to defund to develop teams per se, or a social worker – that type of profession – to address those types of calls, I’m in full support because we’re not the answer,” he said. 
In addition to assisting in reducing the burden on emergency responders, CRTs provide specialized care that helps individuals avoid emergency rooms and in many cases, the routine 72-hour mandatory hold for mental health evaluation known as Legal 2000.  
The $535,000 grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration allowed the county to field a 12-hour crew for six months – from April through September of 2025. The team, composed of a paramedic, an emergency medical technician, and a licensed social worker, is trained to identify diseases that can mimic mental illness. 
The CRT responded to 758 incidents involving 678 patients. Only 30% were taken to emergency rooms, compared with 82% of individuals involved in similar calls in 2024. 
The CRT referred 34% of patients to treatment for substance use, while 27% were transported directly to a behavioral health hospital, and 14% were transported to other community service providers.
The team de-escalated 94% of the incidents and prevented 572 patients from entering Legal 2000 holds. Additionally, 65% of the individuals restrained at the time the CRT arrived on scene no longer needed restraints after the team’s intervention, and only 8% arrived at their destinations in restraints, the report says.
Commissioner Justin Jones says Clark County is the only jurisdiction in Southern Nevada without a CRT. He’s spearheading the effort to permanently fund the program, projected to cost $1.5 million a year for a 12-hour operation, seven days a week. State grants are available for 24-hour operations. 
It would be offset by a potential $1.9 million savings in reimbursements for medical transport. 
Additionally, Medicaid reimbursement is available to help cover the cost of licensed social workers. 
“I would be very nervous about relying on the Medicaid reimbursement dollars, considering what’s going on as a whole,” Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick warned, referring to more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements included in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Commissioner Jim Gibbons noted the CRT provides an opportunity for UMC, which is also expected to face financial challenges posed by Medicaid cuts, to save money by reducing ER admissions. 
The commission took no action Tuesday but is expected to return with proposals for funding a permanent CRT.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UM-1024x548.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:58:24.944362

Wired for Profit: Third in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
BUCKS — South Alabama is where it all washes out.
Here, in the nation’s second-largest delta, the waters of the Deep South wind through the pines and cypresses of the Yellowhammer State, snaking their way into Mobile Bay and on to the Gulf. Among the most biodiverse regions in the country, the Mobile-Tensaw Delta drains 44,000 square miles of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. It’s where the rivers—the Mobile, Tensaw, Blakely, Apalachee, Middle and Spanish Rivers—meet in land dubbed the “American Amazon” by E.O. Wilson, a renowned naturalist born in the state.
The Delta’s history is America’s. At its heart are the island mounds of Bottle Creek, the “principal political and religious center” for the Indigenous Pensacola culture for 300 years before European contact.
About a dozen miles south, beneath the surface of the Mobile River’s muddy waters, lies the wreckage of the Clotilda, widely regarded as the last slave ship to enter the United States. And farther south, still, the Mobile River empties into Mobile Bay, itself a veritable biodiversity hotspot and the cornerstone of a vibrant coastal culture and ecosystem.

But all of that, many residents, experts and environmentalists say, is at risk, because of Alabama Power’s coal ash waste, a toxic leftover from decades of burning coal for electricity.
One 600-acre pit of the toxic coal ash lies along the banks of the Mobile River in the Upper Delta, about 25 miles north of Mobile Bay. There, smokestacks from the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant rise like a sore thumb from a horizon of green, towering over an unlined pond filled with more than 21 million tons of the toxic residue. Holding back the toxic waste from the Mobile River? Earthen dikes.
Alyson Tucker, media relations manager for Alabama Power, one of the nation’s most profitable electric utilities and one of the state’s most powerful companies, said in an email that the company “remains committed to operating in full compliance with environmental regulations. Our plans for closure and groundwater protection fully comply with current state and federal law, are approved by [the Alabama Department of Environmental Management] and are certified by professional engineers.”
“Due to ongoing litigation related to Plant Barry coal ash, we are unable to comment further at this time,” Tucker said.
Leaving coal waste in place under engineered caps, company representatives have long argued, is safe and protective of groundwater—claims that state regulators have accepted but both environmental groups and federal regulators dispute.
Alabama’s American Amazon isn’t the only area placed at risk by Alabama Power’s ghosts of energy past. An Inside Climate News review of the utility’s legally mandated emergency action plans shows that hundreds of square miles of land and waterways would be at risk of inundation in the event of a breach of the barriers holding back toxic waste at its six coal ash pond sites across the state. In total, more than 117 million tons of coal sludge are at issue, stored along Alabama’s waterways.
What to do with all that polluted material has become a controversial question, with federal and state officials at odds over the issue. In 2015, the federal government finalized a rule tightening restriction around how coal waste could be stored. EPA left implementation of the new standards to states, but in May 2024, the agency denied the state of Alabama’s plan to allow Alabama Power and other utilities to continue storing toxic coal ash in unlined pits at sites across the state. Federal officials said the plan would not adequately protect the state’s groundwater from contamination by coal ash residuals following “cap-in-place” closure.
“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure. In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units,” the decision said.
More than a year after the EPA denied Alabama’s coal ash plan, with the Trump administration now running the federal environmental agency, it’s unclear what comes next for the toxic ponds and the government’s now decade-old effort to safely close them.
But one thing is certain, according to Cade Kistler, who leads Mobile Baykeeper, an environmental nonprofit currently in litigation with Alabama Power over the coal ash lagoon at Plant Barry. Until the toxic leftovers of the company’s fossil fuel commitments are moved out of groundwater and away from waterways, the delta and Mobile Bay are an Eden on the edge of disaster.
“The delta is an elegant labyrinth, full of bayous and sloughs and backwaters. If it is flooded with ash, it would be polluting forever,” Kistler said. “There would be no way to effectively clean it up.”
The cost of Kingston
The failure of a dirt dike at a coal ash pond isn’t theoretical. In 2008, a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, breached, spilling more than a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of land and into the Emory River channel. The result was one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The spill cost the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which owned the coal impoundment, over $1 billion to clean up. Ten years after the spill, dozens of the roughly 900 workers employed during the cleanup were already dead. More than 250 were chronically ill. According to the EPA, coal ash contains heavy metal contaminants like mercury, cadmium and arsenic known to cause cancer and other serious effects on the nervous system, heart, kidneys and development.
Both Alabama Power’s own groundwater monitoring reports and measurements taken by researchers from the Mobile River adjacent to Plant Barry confirm heavy metal contamination at the site.
“We identified a significant contribution of toxic metals linked to coal ash near Sister’s Creek, the man-made cooling discharge channel of Plant Barry, particularly during the dry season,” one 2025 study by scientists at the University of Alabama and Texas A&M Universities concluded.  The peer-reviewed paper also pointed to the impacts of climate change as another reason to be wary of Alabama Power’s storage of coal ash on waterways.










The delta is an elegant labyrinth, full of bayous and sloughs and backwaters. If it is flooded with ash, it would be polluting forever.


– Cade Kistler, Mobile Baykeeper



	“There is a plausible concern for acute and chronic toxic metals environmental pollution from the Alabama ash pond, considering rising seawater levels and more frequent severe storm surges in the region since its initial construction,” the study said.
The volume of coal ash material stored at Plant Barry alone is more than four times that of the sludge that spilled in Kingston in 2008, according to company figures. That fact alone should worry anyone concerned about Alabama’s environment, said Diane Thomas, one of three self-proclaimed “coal ash grannies” featured in a new documentary about Plant Barry’s coal lagoons, Sallie’s Ashes.
Thomas spent three decades living on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay.
“I have kayaked and sailed,” she said. “I swam. I crabbed. I fished. My love for the bay and what you can do on the bay runs deep.”

It was an easy “yes,” then, when her decades-long friend Sallie Smith asked Thomas and another friend, Savan Wilson, to help her fight against Alabama Power’s plans to leave coal ash beside the Mobile River. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and felt she needed to spend her remaining time advocating to protect the bay she’d grown to adore. The trio founded the Coal Ash Action Group, a grassroots organization committed to educating Alabamians about an issue unknown to many.
Thomas, a retired clinical psychologist, said it’s easy to fight for something so dear to so many. For decades, the delta and the bay have been an integral part of her family’s lives.

She smiled as she recalled her first jubilee, a naturally occurring event where low oxygen levels in Mobile Bay cause marine life to flee toward shore.
“There is nothing like catching your own crabs,” Thomas said. “Have you ever cleaned 200 crabs? Your thumbs are just raw.”
After her husband was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, no longer able to work, he began to fish almost daily. With aggressive treatment, he survived the disease.
“We ate fresh fish for about eight years—four times a week,” Thomas said.
That type of close connection with the water is something Thomas feels shouldn’t be put at risk unnecessarily by an electric utility.
‘    
A knife to your throat’

Alabama Power’s legally-mandated emergency action plan for Plant Barry shows that if earthen dikes separating the coal ash from the Mobile River were to breach, around 25 square miles of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta would be inundated with coal slurry, covering dozens of miles of the Mobile, Middle and Tensaw Rivers, just upstream of Mobile Bay. From there, the toxic sludge would diffuse throughout the region, with the state’s rivers acting as a heart, pumping the liquid farther and farther from Plant Barry.
“But instead of lifeblood, it’s pumping coal waste that would kill the environment,” Thomas said.
David Bronner, the prominent CEO of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, recently called Plant Barry’s coal ash pond “a huge environmental bomb” in a newsletter sent to state retirees.

“We need your cooperation again for South Alabama,” Bronner wrote in an open appeal to Alabama’s congressional delegation. “Not for new jobs, but for solving an old problem that still exists. That problem hangs over all of Alabama, like a knife to your throat: the coal ash dump that sits next to Mobile Bay. No one should forget what the Tennessee coal ash dump did to that state. A breach of the Mobile site would clearly damage Mobile Bay for decades.”
Thomas believes Bronner’s assessment is on target.


Cade Kistler, Mobile’s Baykeeper, said it’s important to remember that environmental harm can lead to economic pain, too, for individuals and businesses alike.
“There would be a huge impact on the people that want to fish in Mobile Bay and use it for their livelihoods,” he said. “And there are also those people that live on its shores—a lot of beautiful homes and properties. Those Zillow listings won’t look quite so good if a coal ash breach occurs.”

Kistler also pointed out that BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which crippled the Gulf Coast environmentally and economically, involved about 134 million gallons of oil, 20 times less than the volume of coal slurry disposed of at Plant Barry. Those who lived through the aftermath of the oil spill on the Gulf Coast remember the deep impact it had on coastal communities.


A coal ash breach could be even worse, Thomas said.
“If a breach occurred, we would be the most industrially polluted site in the nation, and we know that pollution wouldn’t just go away,” she said.
That’s why she and Wilson have committed themselves to informing others across the state about the dangers of the waste, something they now do in memory of Smith, who died of cancer in October 2023.
“Sallie’s focus was on connecting people in search of our common humanity, and in seeking to deepen our understanding and compassion for one another,” her obituary read. “This ardent effort was an outgrowth and demonstration of her deep faith. She loved her family, Mobile Bay, country music, her many friends, including her hiking group of intrepid college friends, and all God’s people.”

‘Pray we don’t have a hurricane’

While there’s still much to be done to contain the coal ash threat, Thomas said, there have been at least some glimmers of hope. In early 2024, Alabama Power confirmed a plan to contract a company called Eco Materials to remove and recycle some of the coal waste stored at Plant Barry.
Since then, however, there has been little in the way of substantive public updates about the project, which company officials previously said would begin recycling coal ash into construction materials like concrete in January 2026. In response to an inquiry from Inside Climate News, a representative for Alabama Power said the recycling facility is “expected to be in service by early 2026.”
Eco Materials was acquired by materials company CRH in July 2025, according to an announcement. Neither Eco Materials nor CRH responded to a request for a detailed update on the recycling plans.

Still, Thomas said that even the conception of a plan is a step in the right direction.
“We need to recycle as much as possible and just pray we don’t have a hurricane,” she said.
Kistler said he fears just that. An extreme weather event or other emergency could leave a world-renowned environmental gem drowned in polluted sludge.
Alabama Power’s emergency action plans, bare-bones documents required by federal law, provide only limited information about what could occur if a breach happened at its coal ash sites across the state. The documents also provide little real-world information about how the company would approach mitigation, clean up and remediation.
Regarding extreme weather, the 39-page emergency plan for Plant Barry mentions only that if severe weather causes road closures during an emergency dam breach, company response times may be delayed. Despite Plant Barry’s location in south Alabama, the word “hurricane” does not appear in the emergency action plan.
“It’s foolhardy,” Kistler said. “There needs to be more detail.”
Regulators have agreed. In January 2023, the EPA issued Alabama Power a notice of potential violation informing the company that, in the agency’s view, it had violated federal regulations because its groundwater monitoring program and emergency action plan were not adequate.
The agency settled that dispute with Alabama Power in 2024 when the company agreed to “evaluate and expand its groundwater monitoring program at Plant Barry, to review and upgrade its Emergency Action Plan, and to pay a civil penalty of $278,000,” according to the EPA.
More than a year later, a representative of the utility told members of Alabama’s Public Service Commission that an updated emergency action plan is still in the works.
“The emergency action plan will be modified to include additional wording and descriptions to clarify the company’s preparedness for extreme weather conditions,” Dustin Brooks, land compliance manager for Alabama Power, told commissioners on Dec. 9.
“I just hope that outside this public document, they’ve got better plans somewhere,” Kistler said.
A previously available copy of the EPA’s settlement agreement with Alabama Power has been removed from the agency’s website, though the press release announcing the agreement remains. “This Initiative is needed given the breadth and scope of observed noncompliance with the federal coal ash regulations,” the agency said.
An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s coal ash units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s then-vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” coal ash waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.
“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.
In 2019, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.
In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.
Plant Barry is just one of Alabama Power’s six plant sites across the state that store coal ash. In all, the slurry lagoons cover a footprint of around 2,000 acres and pose unique risks to groundwater and waterways around them.
A now capped-in-place coal ash impoundment at Plant Gadsden, for example, is still contaminating groundwater more than seven years after its closure, according to Alabama Power’s groundwater monitoring reports and a lawsuit filed against the utility by Coosa Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit.
“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release after the lawsuit was filed. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”
In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit over groundwater contamination at Plant Gadsden, lawyers for Alabama Power emphasized that state regulators approved the company’s plans for coal ash waste at the site.
When groundwater monitoring identified elevated levels of contaminants, the lawyers wrote, “Alabama Power worked with professional engineers and the public to design and implement a corrective action program to address those exceedances—a program certified as compliant with the federal CCR rule and that will continue as part of ‘post-closure care.’”
While the suit should be dismissed due to an expired statute of limitations, Alabama Power’s attorneys argued, the court should also decline to second guess the decision of state regulators to approve the company’s actions.
“[Coosa Riverkeeper] asks the Court to turn back the clock, to before 2020, to second-guess the groundwater monitoring system and closure decisions—work completed long ago, approved by state regulators, and certified by professional engineers as compliant,” the motion said.
Plants Barry, Gorgas, Greene County and Miller have been designated as having “significant hazard potential” under federal law. Plant Gaston, located near the town of Wilsonville in Shelby County, has been designated as having “high hazard potential.”
Following an emergency dam break at that site, which the company deems “unlikely,” Alabama Power’s initial hazard potential assessment concluded that “water and [coal ash] could potentially impact the residential neighborhood to the west, and the Coosa River to the south…failure or misoperation of the [coal ash] unit could potentially result in a loss of human life.”
Kistler said that it’s notable that Alabama Power is unique among southern utilities in leaving all of its coal waste in unlined pits along waterways. Georgia Power, another subsidiary of Southern Company, has already shifted toward more appropriate disposal of at least some of its coal ash in lined landfills. It’s not a question then, Kistler said, of whether Alabama Power can do the same. It’s only a question of if it will.
“It feels like we’re paying premium prices, and we’re getting bargain-bin environmental protections,” he said, making a reference to Alabama Power’s highest average residential electric bills in the nation. “If Georgia can do it, why not us?”

A coal legacy and a fossil-fueled future

Barry Brock, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, is part of the team of lawyers suing Alabama Power over its coal ash impoundment at Plant Barry. Initially dismissed by a Trump-appointed U.S. district court judge on technical grounds, the case is now pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Brock said he is hopeful the team will secure a victory.
Oral arguments in the case were held in Atlanta in November, and some of Alabama Power’s arguments were unusually revealing, Brock said.
“Alabama Power admits that a lot of the coal ash is going to be left in contact with groundwater under their closure plan,” he said. “That’s particularly galling.”
Coal ash isn’t SELC’s first legal tussle with Alabama Power, however. Lawyers for the environmental nonprofit are also representing customers suing Alabama Power over residential solar fees they argue violate the law and discourage the use of renewable energy. In response, the company has said that it “support[s] customers interested in using onsite generation, such as solar” but that its rate structure for those customers must avoid “unfairly shifting” costs to other ratepayers.
Meanwhile, the company has doubled down on its fossil fuel investments, purchasing a natural gas plant in Autauga County for around $622 million, effectively locking the company into the continued use of fossil fuels for years to come, though the company said in an email that its investments are data-driven, forward-looking and “are not based on a preference for any one fuel source.”
All of these developments are individually concerning, Brock said, and together, they demonstrate a pattern.
“It sends a pretty clear message that Alabama Power is really concerned about their financial well-being and the rate of return they get on fossil fuel infrastructure,” he said. “It says they have a pretty compliant regulatory environment that is not going to scrutinize them when they want to raise rates for customers to do it.”
While the company clearly has the resources to line its coal ash ponds and recycle much of the waste, there’s also little doubt that the state can count on much more sympathetic federal regulators under the Trump EPA than it did under Democratic leadership. At present, the state and federal governments seem closely aligned: Twinkle Cavanaugh recently resigned after 13 years as president of the state’s Public Service Commission, the agency charged with regulating Alabama Power.

Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, discusses his Senate Bill 11, which would allow Indiana to use a firing squad to carry out executions, during a committee meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would allow executions by firing squad if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or at an inmate’s request is fueling ongoing debates over secrecy, drug costs and “humane” methods of capital punishment.
Senators on the Corrections and Criminal Law Committee spent an hour probing Republican Sen. Mike Young’s Senate Bill 11 — and some questioned whether it’s necessary at all — but no vote was held.
Committee Chairman Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said the committee would consider amendments and a possible vote next week. Proposed amendments are due on Friday.
“This is not a debate about the death penalty,” Young, of Indianapolis, told the committee. “We have it in the state of Indiana. So, it’s not whether you think it’s good or whether you think it’s bad. The question here is, ‘What do we do if we only have one option in which to carry out a legal order by the courts in the state of Indiana?’”
Over the past year, Indiana officials have paid as much as $300,000 for a single dose, spending at least $1 million total to procure execution drugs. Gov. Mike Braun disclosed in June that at least $600,000 was spent on pentobarbital that expired before use, citing the drug’s short shelf life and difficulties obtaining it. Braun has since declined to disclose how much the state paid for the most recent doses, including at least one used in the October execution of Roy Ward.










Indiana should not be considering expanding its execution methods while significant issues of public accountability still exist.


– Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center


Young’s bill is one of several death penalty-related measures pending in the 2026 session.
He argued that his proposal is designed to prevent Indiana from being forced into last-minute decisions if lethal injection drugs become unusable.
“If we have an order to carry out an execution, we go get the chemicals, and then we find out, ‘Well, those are out of date and they’re not going to work,’” the senator said. “There’s no way to really test to see if they work, other than apply them, and we don’t want to put a person’s life in anguish to find out whether or not the drugs work.”
Young also told lawmakers that manufacturers and pharmacies can refuse to sell execution drugs on moral grounds, further creating a need for an alternative method. 
“We can’t force them to sell it to us,” he said. “We can’t force them to manufacture it.”
A ‘fail safe’ option
Under current Indiana law, executions can only be carried out by lethal injection. 
Young’s bill details procedures for firing squad executions, requiring a five-member team made up of Department of Correction officers selected by the prison warden.
Four officers would fire weapons containing live ammunition, while one would fire a weapon containing a blank round, with firearms loaded in a way that prevents squad members from knowing which ammunition they are firing. The bill would also shield the identities of firing squad members from public disclosure and legal discovery.
Currently, five states authorize the use of firing squads under certain circumstances: Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Young emphasized that the bill does not mandate the firing squad, but instead creates what he repeatedly described as a “fail-safe” option if lethal injection cannot be carried out.

He also cited the federal prison in Terre Haute, where the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has long carried out executions.
“If the federal government needs to carry out an execution here in Indiana and they can’t obtain the drugs, we shouldn’t be the reason that can’t happen,” Young said.
Before public testimony began, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, asked whether firing squads could pose similar constitutional problems as the electric chair decades ago if an execution did not result in immediate death.
“The idea that we were using the electric chair — it was inhumane,” Pol said. “Oftentimes, somebody would not perish … and you could have a situation in which, during the firing squad, somebody has not perished. … You’re laying witness to what potentially could be cruel and unusual punishment.”
But Young maintained that the central issue with any method is accuracy and avoiding such suffering.
“The question is whether or not the shots that are fired are accurate enough to end the life immediately instead of letting the person suffer,” Young said. “That’s the concern.”
Committee members also raised questions about who would be required to participate in a firing squad and whether staff could object on religious or moral grounds. 
Young said he supports “conscience protections” and would not compel participation. 
“I wouldn’t force somebody to take somebody else’s life,” he said. “If I was the warden, I’d probably take volunteers.”
Specifics still in the works
Five men currently sit on Indiana’s death row at the state prison in Michigan City, though one has been deemed incompetent to be executed. 
Three other men have been executed in Indiana over the past year. In that time, scrutiny has mounted around the state’s execution process and the Department of Correction’s acquisition and handling of lethal injection drugs.

Many of the questions center on the cost, sourcing, storage and effectiveness of pentobarbital. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
Tuesday’s testimony highlighted concerns that chemical executions can fail or cause prolonged suffering if drugs degrade or are improperly administered. Questions have lingered, for example, around the quality of the drugs used in last year’s execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Bill co-author Sen. Jim Tomes, R-Wadesville, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the firing squad could be structured to “minimize the risk of error.” He described a system using five shooters and rifles fixed in place by technicians so that all rounds strike the same point. The senator said he preferred live rounds and no blanks for all shooters.
“A technician would set the rifles up so all of the barrels are pointed at the same point of impact,” Tomes said. “They’re fixed. There’s no movement. The guns have been set so that the impact is all going to be at the same center of mass.”
Young was supportive, saying the goal is to ensure executions are carried out “efficiently and effectively so no person suffers.”
Opposition centers on secrecy, oversight
Opponents warned, though, that the bill would expand capital punishment while shielding “critical” details from public scrutiny.
Samantha Bresnahan of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana said Senate Bill 11 would impose “unprecedented secrecy” around executions by making confidential the identities of firing squad members and any information that could reasonably lead to their identification.
“That language is extraordinarily broad,” she said. “It could shield basic facts about training, qualifications, selection criteria and safeguards — precisely the information the public needs to evaluate whether this process is lawful, competent and free from misconduct.”
Even so, current Indiana law protects much of that information already, including the identities of the state prison’s execution team. 
Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, additionally testified in opposition, calling the bill “a solution in search of a problem.”
“Indiana should not be considering expanding its execution methods while significant issues of public accountability still exist,” Dunham said. “Executions are among the most serious acts a government can undertake, yet this bill would allow this method to be implemented behind a veil of secrecy.”
DOC silent, amendments ahead
Public defenders also questioned whether Young’s bill would meaningfully address the cost or availability of executions. 
Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council said execution drugs are not a major cost driver compared with decades of litigation. He noted that since 1990, Indiana has spent more than $30 million on constitutionally-required defenses in capital cases.
“Trading expensive drugs for inexpensive bullets is not going to meaningfully reduce the cost,” Stock said. “Method of execution has never been the problem.”
Faith-based groups raised concerns about the moral and psychological toll on those involved.
Roarke LaCoursiere of the Indiana Catholic Conference warned that participation in executions can cause long-term trauma for witnesses and staff.
“Under this bill, we would be asking five people to pull the trigger, not for the purpose of saving life, but for the purpose of ending it,” LaCoursiere said.
DOC officials were present at Tuesday’s hearing but did not testify publicly.
Young’s bill is one of several death-penalty-related measures so far filed in the short 2026 session.
House Bill 1119, authored by Reps. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, and Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, would also allow executions by firing squad — or nitrogen hypoxia — while keeping lethal injection as the default method unless an inmate requests otherwise.
Another filed by Ireland, House Bill 1314, seeks to speed up post-conviction relief proceedings, likely reducing the time inmates spend on death row before execution.
Separately, House Bill 1287, filed by Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, would require members of the General Assembly to volunteer to serve on execution teams and make their names public records.
Last session, Morris unsuccessfully pushed to abolish Indiana’s death penalty entirely or, alternatively, to increase transparency around execution protocols.
Young said he expects multiple amendments to be filed to his bill before Friday’s deadline, including potential changes related to firing squad procedures.
“This is about making sure the state can carry out the law in a way that is orderly, constitutional and humane,” Young said. “We’re going to continue to work through the details.”

Dils Medical Center in Caliente, Nevada. (Photo: Nevada Rural Hospital Partners) While health authority officials updated state lawmakers on Tuesday on how the state will use $180 million in federal rural hospital funding provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill, they’re also trying to gauge how the allocation compares to the projected loss in funds rural Nevada will face due to pending Medicaid cuts scheduled go into effect in in less than a year.
President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax cut bill passed last year included a $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program to offset part of the bill’s substantial cuts to Medicaid. Half of the rural health money will be distributed equally among each state between fiscal years 2026 and 2030, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The remaining $25 billion is being allocated to states based on several factors, such as steps states are taking to improve access to care in rural communities.
The administration unveiled the breakdown of initial state funding last week, which showed the amount of funding Nevada receives from the Trump administration program will rank among the lowest 10 of the 50 states.
Nationally, the rural funding program would only offset a little more than one-third of the bill’s estimated $137 billion cuts to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. 
Nevada could lose an estimated $553 million according to that analysis.
The state’s Medicaid office is waiting for federal guidance on changes affecting one substantial funding stream, the state’s hospital provider tax program, which provides “significant funding to roughly 45 private hospitals” including six private rural hospitals, said Allison Genco Herzik, the chief of staff with Nevada Health Authority, in an email Tuesday.
“Early estimates of the impact of these changes show … $600-$800 million a year in reduced provider tax related payments to hospitals by the end of 2028,” she said in an email. “Based on the current distribution of provider tax funds in Nevada, the impact of these losses will fall primarily on the state’s urban acute hospitals, and not rural hospitals.”
Officials with the Nevada Health Authority gave members of the legislative Interim Committee on Health and Human Services a general overview of how the $179.9 million federal grant funding will be prioritized Tuesday.
The federal funding is expected to support four initiatives with the largest portion, roughly 40%, targeted at attracting health care providers to rural parts of the state, said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority. 
However, one idea the state initially proposed was rejected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and its administrator, physician and former media celebrity Mehmet Oz. 
“We wanted to do a loan repayment program, a very large one,” Weeks said. “We heard very loud and clear from Dr. Oz and others — they were not interested in that.”
The plan, instead, proposes using funds to for incentives such as signing bonuses or housing assistance to entice health care providers to move to rural areas. 
Other initiatives prioritized by Nevada health officials include a “rural health outcomes accelerator” to address root causes of chronic diseases, and a rural health care “flex fund.”
“We heard a lot from our rural hospitals that can’t afford to buy an ambulance or can’t afford the new x-ray machine or mammogram, all the things they need to support their community,” Weeks said. “This flex fund is to support those one-time infrastructure needs.” 
Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill also directs 15% of the rural health funding program toward health innovation and technology, which Weeks said “was something CMS really wanted to see in our applications.” The idea would be to fund new technologies around telehealth or “artificial intelligence” tools in health care. 
“We had multiple vendors wanting this money, and that is not always bad,” Weeks said. “I want to be mindful that this money is sustainable for communities and actually is going to improve health care. We want to be careful it’s not just a slush fund for every new idea, and that these are meaningful and evidence-based solutions.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/caliente-1024x623.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

Tim Walz announces he will step down from the 2026 gubernatorial election Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota trailed the nation in economic growth during Gov. Tim Walz’s tenure, but Minnesotans continued to enjoy higher wages than most states, lower unemployment and a decrease in crime.
Walz announced the end of his campaign for a third term on Monday in the face of increasing pressure from his own party and attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.
He said he takes accountability for the fraud that happened on his watch as well as the successes of his administration through the remarkable lows and highs of his tenure: the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, Democrats winning control of state government and passing a sweeping progressive agenda, and the assassination of his friend and colleague Melissa Hortman.
“If the buck stops with me on when there’s problems, the buck stops with me on successes,” Walz said at a Tuesday news conference celebrating the rollout of the state’s paid family leave program.
Here are eight charts exploring how the state has been doing over the course of Walz’s tenure since 2019.


Minnesota’s economy grew slower than the nation’s, as measured by gross domestic product — the state’s output of goods and services. The U.S. economy grew around 16% since 2019, while Minnesota’s grew 10% in the same time frame.
The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which represents companies in Minnesota, published a report in November finding that job growth and income growth in the state is also not keeping pace with the nation’s.


Unemployment is creeping back up after a low in 2022 according to the September data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Unemployment in Minnesota remains lower compared to the U.S. as a whole, but higher than some other states in the region.
In an August release, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development Commissioner Matt Varilek said that employment trends might be the result of federal layoffs, funding freezes and tariff policies under the Trump administration, along with shrinking immigration.


Minnesotans still earn the highest average hourly wages in the Midwest. The average Minnesota worker earned $37.58 per hour in 2024, compared to $32.66 nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Wages have generally matched or outpaced inflation over the past several decades. Although high inflation coming out of the pandemic eroded many workers’ buying power, wage growth has since caught up. Low-wage workers — particularly those in nursing homes and food service — benefited the most from a tight labor market, which has pushed wages up much more quickly than inflation in recent years.


Index crimes — a group of eight serious crimes that law enforcement agencies use to track crime over time — were lower in 2024 than at the start of Walz’s term in 2019, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
The total crime rate in 2024 was at a multi-decade low, driven by a drop in property crimes. Meanwhile, homicide rates dropped from a COVID-era spike but still remained high.


Minnesota students’ performance on state-wide standardized tests have stagnated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools in 2020. Proficiency rates in reading and math in 2025 were 10 percentage points lower than they were in 2019. In 2025, fewer than half of Minnesota students met grade-level expectations for reading and math.


More Minnesota families are getting their kids out of routine vaccinations, reflecting growing vaccine skepticism across the nation bolstered by President Donald Trump’s appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
Nearly 6% of Minnesota kindergartners received non-medical vaccine exemptions in 2024, compared to 3.4% in 2019.


Even so, Minnesotans can expect to live longer than people in other states in the Midwest, according to the National Center for Health Statistics’ life expectancy estimates for a person born in 2022.


State Fair attendance — an important metric of Minnesotans’ pride in their Minnesotan-ness — was a record high in 2019. The pandemic put a damper on sales of pronto pups and other sticked foods, with the 2020 state fair cancelled and the 2021 state fair only hosting 1.3 million people, compared to 2.1 million in 2019.
Attendance has been rising since then, though, with numbers back up to 1.9 million in the past two years.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9332-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

Tom Barrett in the November election, is putting anti-corruption reforms at the forefront of her first big policy rollout as the 2026 election cycle begins.
Brink, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who resigned in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies in the region, on Wednesday announced her plans for cleaning up Washington, D.C. across all three branches of the federal government.
“The chaos and corruption coming out of Washington is costing Michiganders,” Brink said in a statement. “We need a principled, pragmatic reform agenda and leaders willing to fight like hell to restore faith in government and clean up Washington.”
First on the list is to officially ban the offices of the president and vice president, members of Congress, all executive branch employees and U.S. Supreme Court justices from trading individual stocks. Brink is also proposing a permanent, lifetime ban on members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, and prohibiting their immediate family members from serving as registered lobbyists during their time in office.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Brink said she would push for a constitutional amendment creating term limits for Congress, while also advocating for measures to block pay to members during government shutdowns.
Legislation clarifying and limiting the powers of the president to issue pardons would also be top of mind for Brink should she win the August primary and defeat Barrett (R-Charlotte) in the fall general election.
Also on the proposed policy list are:

A ban on all branches receiving gifts of more than $20;
A  constitutional amendment overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, effectively banning the unlimited spending of dark money by corporations and wealthy individuals; and
A new, binding code of ethics for the president, vice president, Congress, executive appointees, and the high court’s justices, which would include a requirement for full financial and tax disclosures.

Brink said the policy proposals were aimed at restoring people’s faith in government. 
“That means standing up for what’s right, speaking truth to power, and delivering real results — even if it means risking one’s career. I’ve done that throughout my 28 years of service to our country and I’ll do it again in Congress,” Brink said.
The Democratic primary race for the 7th District also includes retired Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam, Elyon Badger, William Lawrence, Alexandra Prieditis and Muhammad Salman Rais.

Not if you’re the Mississippi House speaker,Emily Wagster Pettus,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/mississippi-house-speaker-press-restriction/,"The door of House Speaker Jason White's office in the Mississippi Capitol on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
For journalists, getting into a politician’s press conference at the Mississippi Capitol shouldn’t be like trying to get into a fancy party at a country club.
Not on the invitation list? You’re out of luck.
House Speaker Jason White and his staff made a bumble-headed decision by blocking a Mississippi Today reporter from attending White’s pre-legislative session Q&A on Monday – a decision that violates the principles of government transparency. 
The invitation-only press conference was open to most news organizations that regularly cover the Legislature, and it took place in White’s office in the Capitol. The Republican from West occupies the space because his House colleagues chose him as their leader and because taxpayers are footing the bill to keep the office running.
Mississippi Today published an investigative report last April about Speaker White, members of his staff and some of their spouses taking a trip to the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Expenses for the trip were paid, at least in part, by DraftKings, a gaming company that has invested heavily in lobbying for legal online betting. After Mississippi Today posted its report, the speaker’s office stopped sending Mississippi Today advisories about press conferences and stopped responding to the newsroom’s requests for comments.
Mississippi Speaker of the House Jason White and some of his staff and spouses attended the Super Bowl.
Monday’s closed-door press conference happened the day before Mississippi legislators started their three-month session. It was the only opportunity White provided for journalists – on behalf of the public – to question him about the all-important issues he will push during this third year of a four-year term, including an effort to let some people spend public money in private schools.
Legislators make decisions each session that can change the lives of everyday Mississippians. Members of the House and Senate distribute billions of taxpayer dollars and set policies that could alter access to education and health care, roads and bridges, public welfare and public safety.
Mississippi Today and other news organizations send journalists to the Capitol to report on what elected officials are discussing and doing. It’s vital work that journalists take seriously because – let’s face it – most Mississippians are busy with their own lives and can’t drop everything to keep an eye on elected officials.
Some of the most substantial Capitol news coverage is rooted in source development. Journalists build relationships of trust with legislators, lobbyists or others who provide inside information about what’s happening that might not be readily apparent to the general public. Good journalists don’t regurgitate unvetted information. Instead, they verify it and put it in context.
Press conferences often provide ready-made news on a plate and sometimes provide no news at all. They are generally open to all credentialed journalists. For decades, standard practice has been for politicians’ staffers to notify Mississippi Capitol reporters about these events, whether they are in open-access areas such as the building’s marble-lined rotunda or in an office or a conference room. 
Even politicians who grumble about news coverage or editorials have generally avoided taking overt steps to exclude certain news organizations from press conferences. That includes, notably, Kirk Fordice, the state’s first Republican governor in modern times.
Fordice served two terms in the 1990s and was the first governor I covered during my 31 years as a Capitol journalist. Fordice constantly groused about the media. One of his favorite complaints was about editorial writers at The Clarion-Ledger, or as he derisively called them, “pencil pushers on Pearl Street.” (To get the full effect, say that out loud and emphasis each P so much that you nearly spit.) Fordice generally gave the Capitol reporters access to his events, even as he chewed us out for asking questions he didn’t like.
White acknowledged Monday that he engaged in picking and choosing which journalists could show up and ask him questions during his pre-session gathering. 
“The Media Q+A hosted in my office today was an invitation-only media opportunity, not an open, public press conference,” he said in a statement to the Clarion Ledger.
That’s a weird attempt to differentiate between “media Q&A” and “press conference,” which are the same thing. And it’s the kind of statement that comes from a public official who’s not committed to government transparency.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06160556/829A0689.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

They take an oath to do just that.
Unfortunately, it seems some of our statewide officials have decided that they simply can declare what the law is and we are all expected to follow. They did not learn the rule from kindergarten: just because you say something does not make it so.
In early December, more than 300,000 signatures were submitted to the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office to put the question of whether the state legislature’s mid-decade redistricting congressional map should be adopted. These Missourians spoke with a common voice, loud and clear, that they wanted a statewide vote, a right which is guaranteed to them by the Missouri Constitution.
The Missouri Constitution is quite clear on the referendum process, backed by more than a century of case law: the voters have a right to vote on legislation passed by the Missouri General Assembly, and the legislation in question takes effect only when approved by voters.
Previous secretaries of state and attorneys general, both Republican and Democratic, have followed the law, which was the case in 2017, when then Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft suspended the legislature’s “right to work” law when the required number of signatures were gathered to put the measure on the ballot.
Yet current Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, with the assistance of Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, has decided to ignore established precedent and black letter law by declaring that the law is not stopped until a vote of the people occurs, and instead the new map is now in effect. They are waving off the will of the hundreds of thousands of Missourians who signed the petition and attempting to thwart the ability of millions more to vote on the measure.
Hoskins should stop and consider what his job is. As part of his duties, he has the right to determine that the submitted signatures are insufficient, which is subject to a quick judicial review. He has not chosen to do this. What he does not have is the authority to decide which bill, will, or will not, get enacted into law pending the outcome of a vote of the people.
By choosing to simply declare the new map in effect, Hoskins and Hanaway are not only disregarding the law, they are sowing chaos. Both candidates and elected officials have no idea which congressional districts will be in effect. Furthermore, by this attempt to impose the maps by his will alone, they are further delaying the ability of the referendum process to move forward.
All of this undermines Missourians’ confidence in their democracy and damages both our legal and political systems.
Now Missouri voters have had to file a lawsuit just to require Hoskins and Hanaway to follow the law. This latest court battle is one of many that have been generated by the opposition of our statewide officials. It is disturbing our secretary of state and attorney general have dedicated so much time and taxpayer money to keep the people from having a voice. They need to respect that the more than 300,000 petition signers have spoken and asked for a vote regarding fair and equal representation in the United States Congress. They need to stop with the delaying tactics and support this right of voters.
The people of Missouri reserved the right in our state Constitution to have the final say over legislation. Hoskins cannot just wish that away.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:58:13.856938

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A bill that would require school districts to inform parents when students want to use pronouns and names that differ from the ones given to them at birth received significant pushback Tuesday during a Senate Education Committee hearing.
The committee also took testimony on a bill to add video requirements to human growth and development curriculum as well as to opt the state into a federal school choice tax credit program.
Under SB 120, Wisconsin schools would be required to adopt a policy on name and pronoun changes by July 1, 2026. Policies would not require written authorization if school staff are using a shortened version of a student’s first or middle name.
Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc) argued that the measure was needed to standardize policies across the state and ensure parents are involved in conversations related to pronoun and name changes for students. Many testified in opposition to the bill, saying it would do harm to students and infringe on local decision making. 
“It is deeply troubling to me that school staff are being encouraged to keep parents out of major life decisions concerning their children, while at the same time these same officials cannot give them aspirin without parental approval. Why would schools promote secrecy in such a way?” Jacque said. “Something has gone terribly wrong in our education system if officials inherently perceive parents as harmful to their own children. Parents are legally accountable for the health and welfare of their own children… Hiding from us important things that are going on in their lives is not only disrespectful to parents, it is harmful to our children.” 
Jacque said the legislation would be consistent with a 2023 ruling by a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge, which found that a policy that allowed students in the Kettle Moraine School District to change their names and pronouns in school violated the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children. The school district now has a policy that requires express parental consent for staff to use different names and pronouns. 
“To me, if there’s going to be a name and pronoun change the school should be working together with parents and students to advance that together,” Dittrich said. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) pushed back on the Republican bill, saying it would infringe on local communities’ ability to make decisions about policies and would harm students.
“You could sub out the words ‘parental decision making’ and say that the Legislature is going to have the best authority of what should happen — instead of parents, instead of local governments, instead of local school boards. You’re saying that you guys know better,” Larson said. 
“That’s a total distortion of what the bill does,” Dittrich said.
Larson asked the bill authors to consider a situation where parents may not be accepting of a student who wants to use a different name and pronouns. 
“You are expediting that situation by making it come to a head when there are parents who are less than understanding, who are brought up under a very strict and very incorrect… and you are forcing the question in a vulnerable population that is already overly targeted with transphobia with this, which is already overly targeted for bullying, which is already higher than the average rates of suicide and mental health. You are bullying them by bringing this bill forward,” Larson said.
“You are saying we should hide information and not facilitate those conversations,” Jacque replied. Dittrich added that Larson was “trampling all over parental rights.”
Paul Bartlett, a father of two transgender children, said the bill works to “prioritize the unfounded fears of conservative parents over the well-being of children.” 
“Like any parent, I want my children to thrive and be happy. They are well supported against these continued legislative attacks, but many trans and nonbinary kids are not,” Bartlett said. He said that school should be a refuge for unsupported students, “not a place where teachers are obligated to out and humiliate them.” 
Bartlett pointed out that lawmakers recently approved a law, known as Bradyn’s Law, that seeks to protect young people from being sexually extorted online. 
“That everyone agreed on [that bill] was important because what we were doing was preventing teenagers from killing themselves basically from humiliation… and yet these bills, they do the opposite,” Bartlett said. 
Bartlett noted that anti-trans laws have a negative effect on young transgender people. 
According to a 2024 survey by the Trevor Project, 45% of transgender and nonbinary youth have reported that they or their family have considered moving to a different state due to anti-LGBTQ+ politics and laws, and about 90% have said that their wellbeing was negatively affected by  recent politics. 
The Trevor Project survey, which pulled from the experiences of over 18,000 LGBTQ+ youth, also found that 39% of LGBTQ+ young people, including 46% of transgender and nonbinary young people, had seriously considered attempting suicide. 
“I just don’t understand, like, why do we keep doing this?” Bartlett said.
Abigail Swetz, executive director of FAIR Wisconsin, said bills that target transgender youth contribute to the mental health struggles they face. 
The bill is part of a slate of bills that Wisconsin Republicans introduced related to transgender people, including children, last year. According to the 2025 anti-trans bills tracker, there were over 1,020 bills introduced across the country including 20 in Wisconsin. 
“Inclusive policies, like making it possible for students to use an affirming name and the pronouns that best represent their identity in school in an easily accessible way — those policies are a pressure valve making it possible for [youth] to live fully and healthily,” Swetz said. 
Swetz said when she previously worked as a teacher she helped support students that were preparing to share information about themselves with their family and said it was important to follow the child’s lead. 
“The youth themselves are the experts in their own experience and have a better understanding than anyone about the challenges they might face when it comes to acceptance and safety at home. I have witnessed that conversation go well, and I have seen it go badly,” Swetz said. She said the bill that lawmakers were pushing “aims to traffic in distrust while a process like this, one that is directed by a well-supported young person, is actually how we can build trust between parents, children and school staff.” 
Peggy Wirtz-Olson, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), said she was speaking out against the bill on behalf of the students who would be “devastated” by the bill. 
“All students deserve safe and welcoming schools, not only some of them, every single one of them, and that includes our trans students,” Wirtz-Olsen said. “The simple use of preferred names and pronouns is associated with a large decrease in depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and even suicidal attempts. Respecting preferred names and pronouns is a proven measure to show respect, earn trust, affirm our students, so they can feel safe, and they can focus on learning.”
Requiring videos of fetal development
Lawmakers also took testimony on a bill to add requirements for schools that offer human growth and development education. 
Human growth and development is optional for Wisconsin school districts, but for those that do opt in, state law includes some requirements including encouraging abstinence for students who are unmarried. 
SB 371 would add requirements that explanations of pregnancy, prenatal development and childbirth include a high definition video that shows the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other organs, a rendering of the fertilization process and fetal development as well as a presentation on each trimester of pregnancy and the physical and emotional health of the mother. 
The bill would also require that instruction on parental responsibility include information on the importance of secure interpersonal relationships for infant mental health and on the value of reading to young children. 
Bill coauthors Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) rejected the assertion that the bill is a mandate, noting that school districts do not have to teach human growth and development. 
“Today’s youth are technologically and visually inclined learners. We should lean into this to better convey this important information,” Felzkowski said. She also added that there should be bipartisan agreement around “preparing the young women of today with all the knowledge they could need to prepare for motherhood and young men for fatherhood.” 
“Being able to actually see the real life process of fetal development in action will be more tangible to students than textbooks or seeing it in a still diagram or a drawing. We have a resource at our disposal to bring science into our classroom and we should use it to our advantage to give students a stronger educational experience,” Nedweski said.
Nedweski also said it “might not be obvious to some people that using an iPad as a babysitter is not healthy” and that it is “far more important for their health to read to children and to bond with them.”
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) asked the lawmakers what type of research they had to back up the change to state law.
“There’s not one specific scientific research that we’re relating this to,” Felzkowski said. “Just Google it and numerous things will pop up, or we can have our staff do that for you.”
No one spoke against the bill. 
The Wisconsin Public Health Association (WPHA) and the Wisconsin Association of Local Health Departments and Boards are registered against the bill, according to the Wisconsin Lobbying website. The organizations outlined their concerns with the Assembly version of the bill in a statement to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
The organizations said it opposed the legislation in part because it doesn’t do anything to restore the educational standards that were in place under the Healthy Youth Act. The former state law, which included a more comprehensive policy that required providing age-appropriate instruction in human growth and development, was adopted in 2010 but was later repealed in 2012 during a special session under former Gov. Scott Walker, who reestablished abstinence-only education. 
“Evidence-based, comprehensive instruction is essential to equip students with accurate information and skills necessary to make informed decisions about their sexual health, reducing rates of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. It also promotes healthy relationships, consent, and emotional well-being, contributing to overall public health and safety,” the organizations said in the statement.
DPI spokesperson Chris Bucher told the Examiner in an email that the state already has similar guidelines for human development instruction in state law and said the bill is an example of infringing on local control. 
“It is up to districts to determine human development curriculum for what best fits their community. This is also another unfunded mandate for districts choosing to offer human development. District budgets are already stretched thin,” Bucher said. “If the Legislature wants to mandate specific instruction, they should provide funding for curriculum.”
Federal choice tax credit program 
SB 600 would instruct Gov. Tony Evers to opt Wisconsin into a federal school choice tax credit program.
Gov. Tony Evers has previously said he will not opt Wisconsin into the program, and if the bill were passed by the Senate and Assembly instructing Evers to take action, he could veto the legislation. 
A provision in the federal law signed by President Donald Trump in July, which goes into effect in 2027, will provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support certain educational expenses including tuition and board at private schools, tutoring and books. 
However, governors in each state must decide whether to opt in and have until Jan. 1, 2027 to do so.
Felzkowski said it would be “shortsighted and self-defeating” to not opt into the tax credit, noting that other states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Nebraska, Texas, South Dakota and Iowa, are already opting in. 
If Wisconsinites opt into the federal tax credit, the money will be directed to private schools outside the state if the law does not pass, Felzkowski said. “Our dollars will be going to those states… instead of our students here in the state of Wisconsin.”

Vaneta Becker's legislation would criminalize doxing threats. She is pictured in the Senate chamber on Dec. 10, 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers hope to crack down on doxing after more than a dozen of their own became victims of threats amid a turbulent but unsuccessful redistricting campaign.
Doxing is the public release of someone’s personal information, without their consent, as a threat.
Senate Bill 140 would make that a Class A misdemeanor, or a felony if the doxing results in serious injury or death.
“Basically it’s what Sen. (Spencer) Deery and Sen. (Greg) Goode and Sen. (Jean) Leising and several others over the redistricting … experienced,” said bill author Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, told the Senate’s Corrections and Criminal Law committee Tuesday.
Targeted lawmakers included those for and against President Donald Trump’s failed push to eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic congressional seats in favor of a 9-0 Republican delegation, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
As threats escalate against Indiana lawmakers, Braun says his family also targeted

The Indiana Senate voted the maps down mid-December, after months of intense pressure and weeks of threats.
Those included swatting attempts at lawmakers’ homes — hoax reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — plus bomb threats and more.
“I was threatened to have my family killed in front of me, whereafter I would be killed,” redistricting bill author Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, revealed mid-meeting last month.
Indiana State Police are leading an ongoing investigation into the intimidation against lawmakers.
While Tuesday’s discussion centered on lawmakers impacted during redistricting, everyday Americans are increasingly seeing their personal information spread across social media as retaliation for a wide range of disagreements.
Becker’s legislation would criminalize intentionally posting the personal information of a targeted person — or close connections — as a threat, in retaliation for something legal the targeted person did.
Personal information would include someone’s Social Security number, address or phone number, along with the name or address of their employer or places they frequent.
The definition for threat pulls from the state’s intimidation statute. Posts to social media would count, as would emails and other forms of electronic communication.
Tweaks to some of the bill’s definitions are expected.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said the bill’s definition of a “closely connected” person was too vague. It would include the target’s spouse, sibling, child, parent and grandparent, but also an unrelated person living in the same household, a dating partner or a coworker.
Committee Chair Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, assured her he would clarify the “broad” language in an amendment on Friday, before a vote on the bill.

“There’s a lot of benefit to people that disagree getting together and talking about it, and we do that all the time,” Freeman said later.
“How anybody is 45 years old, living in their mother’s basement and never having a relationship with anybody, and getting on a computer and doing this stuff? ” Freeman said. “… My God, can we be adults about this?”
He especially bemoaned the targeting of families with children.
The Class A misdemeanor created in Becker’s bill could rise to a Level 6 felony if a post results in serious bodily injury, or a Level 5 felony if it results in catastrophic injury or death.
Included are protections for those who make reports to law enforcement, prosecutors, and the Department of Child Services “reasonably and in good faith.”
The bill additionally appears to protect constituent communication and organizing, protecting those who engage in “lawful and constitutionally protected activity as it pertains to speech, assembly, and petition.”

A bill to change the unemployment insurance rules has divided lawmakers despite being offered by the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)A bill that would boost Wisconsin’s top weekly jobless pay while penalizing people who receive federal disability pay is heading to the Assembly floor — so far with only GOP support.
The legislation, AB 652, would also impose several previously vetoed changes to the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) law. It passed the Assembly’s labor committee Tuesday on a 6-3 vote, with all committee Democrats voting no.
The bill came from the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. With equal participation of labor and management, the council negotiates changes to the state’s unemployment insurance law every two years.
The council historically has been credited with giving neither side a lopsided advantage in revisions to the unemployment insurance system. The bill that the body offered for the current legislative session, however, has become problematic for some of the council’s staunchest advocates.

“I simply cannot vote for this particular bill as written,” said Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) at Tuesday’s vote by the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment.
The measure would increase the maximum jobless pay for the first time in 12 years — to $395 a week from $370.
It would also formally repeal a 12-year-old ban on unemployment benefits for people who receive federal Social Security Disability Income. At the same time, however, it would cut an SSDI recipient’s jobless payments by the equivalent of half their weekly disability income.
A federal judge ruled in July 2024 that Wisconsin’s ban violated federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
In 2025 the judge ordered the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to stop denying jobless pay for SSDI recipients. The department was also ordered to review the cases going back to 2015 of people denied unemployment insurance due to the ban and make payments to those who were otherwise eligible.
Sinicki has long championed the role of the UI advisory council in revising the state’s UI laws, criticizing changes Republicans have proposed that didn’t go through the joint labor-management body.
Despite that, she’s been an outspoken critic of the UI advisory council’s current bill since it was introduced in November, and reiterated her opposition Tuesday because of the SSDI penalty.
Sinicki described an autistic constituent who works “a few hours a day” at a library. “She counts on that money. If she loses that job, she’s out that money,” Sinicki said. “We’re talking about a very small amount of money. It’s not saving the state millions and millions of dollars” to claw it back.
She predicted the bill would run afoul of the court order blocking the SSDI ban.
Sinicki also criticized “the paltry $25 increase” in the maximum weekly benefit.
“When you look around at the states around us, most of them are paying out twice as much as we do here,” she said. “And I just think it’s a slap in the face.”
Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton) chairs the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)
State Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), the committee chair, defended the legislation.
“This is increasing what people are getting when they claim [unemployment],” Melotik said. “And it also is legal based on what the agreed-upon deal has been.”
In addition to its SSDI penalty, AB 652 would write into the state’s UI law changes that were in previous bills Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed — two of them in the current legislative session.
Those provisions would penalize unemployment insurance recipients accused of “ghosting” job interviews or failing to show up for an offered job; increase the scrutiny of recipients’ work searches; impose new requirements for applicants to prove their identities; and require DWD to follow specific steps, including checking databases that track death records, employment records, citizenship and immigration records, to confirm the identity of a UI applicant.
Evers’ office did not respond Tuesday to an inquiry about whether he planned to sign or veto the UI council legislation if it reaches his desk. In vetoing previous UI-related bills, Evers has cited in part the failure to put them through the advisory council process.
DWD, however, “has a number of concerns with the UIAC agreed upon bill package,” according to written testimony the department filed with the committee at a November public hearing on the bill.
Rachel Harvey, DWD’s legislative director, wrote that the bill’s $25 increase in the top weekly benefit from the maximum set in 2013 amounts to less than 7%. The increase “remains far below the maximum weekly benefit rate in neighboring states,” she wrote.
Harvey wrote that the testimony was provided “for information only,” but showed no enthusiasm for the legislation.
“The bill package includes reductions of Ul benefits for recipients of SSDI, multiple provisions previously vetoed by Gov. Evers, costly work search audit requirements, redundant measures already in effect at DWD to ensure program integrity, and new barriers for individuals receiving benefits,” she wrote
It makes those changes, she added, “all while failing to provide adequate resources for the department to implement these provisions in their entirety.”



Worker’s compensation changes get unanimous support
By contrast Tuesday, the Assembly committee unanimously endorsed legislation that would update Wisconsin’s worker’s compensation laws. That bill was also the product of a separate joint labor-management body, the The Worker’s Compensation Advisory Council.
AB 651 increases the maximum weekly compensation for a permanent, partial disability, currently $446, to $454 for workplace injuries before Jan. 1, 2027 and to $462 for injuries on or after that date.
It also increases supplemental benefits for permanent total disability. Those benefits had applied to people injured at work before Jan. 1, 2003, but the new bill extends them to cover workplace injuries before Jan. 1, 2020.
The legislation gives volunteer firefighters, emergency medical responders and emergency medical practitioners coverage for post-traumatic stress disorders that is in line with the coverage already available to law enforcement officers and non-volunteer firefighters.
The bill also makes numerous other procedural and administrative changes.

The kingdom of God is within, should we so choose, but not in the Capitol or the courthouse, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Jesus, Jefferson and the separation of church and state appeared first on WyoFile .","When I hear anyone claim that separation of church and state doesn’t exist, and that the United States is a Christian nation, I have to chuckle at their lack of understanding. There are lots of Christian citizens, for certain, just as there are many Americans of other faiths. But we are not a Christian nation, nor were we founded to be a religious state.

Opinion

We were founded to be a nation in which all citizens are free to believe in any god they want, or to not believe. Emphasis on free.
The original 13 colonies were religious colonies to be sure, and there was no separation between church and state. But the First Amendment to our Constitution changed that forever.
Here’s an example. In the Virginia Colony in the mid-1700s, the Anglican Church was the official state religion. A Virginian could not hold public office unless he was a member of the state-sanctioned church.
The colony also levied taxes on all citizens, regardless of religion, that went directly to the Church of England clergy, to the church hierarchy and to support church property, a wealth transfer that the Wyoming Constitution strictly prohibits today.
State and church were so intertwined that colonial government enforced church law. Heresy was a capital crime under colonial law. If a Virginian disagreed with Anglican Church doctrine, or bad-mouthed the Archbishop of Canterbury, it was the colony that prosecuted and punished the offense because church and state were virtually the same entity.
Those church laws were not voted upon by the citizens, but were handed down by clerics who were themselves not elected. Yet, citizens, regardless of denomination, were punished if they did not obey those laws. When there is no separation of church and state, that is what citizens can expect.
Thomas Jefferson came of age under Virginia’s repressive church/state thumb. When he was elected to the Virginia General Assembly, he drafted and passed the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786, a year before our Constitution was drafted.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

The Virginia Statute was an Enlightenment Age document and clearly expressed the primacy of human freedom over religious dogma. Under that secular law, all people were free to express their religious beliefs without interference from the state. All religious beliefs, not just Christianity, were liberated from state control. It was among the first expressions of the separation between church and state in human history.
And it was the model for James Madison’s First Amendment.
This is the constitutional framework that exists today, regardless of what Christian nationalists or hair-on-fire mercantile evangelists preach. Human spirituality is free from the greedy hands of the political state. What is Caesar’s is rendered unto Caesar, and what is God’s is rendered unto God. That’s regardless of what God is worshiped or which political party holds power.
The First Amendment, in fact, the very first part of it, guarantees government cannot establish a religion or prevent anyone from practicing their own religion. That guarantee leaves no room for government in the world of faith, and vice versa. It is a clear separation.
In the United States, under our Constitution, religion is free of government control and government is free of religious control. I would have it no other way.
Absent that separation, theocracies emerge where governments impose and enforce religious laws, as in countries subject to Sharia Law, on all of the citizens. And governments are free to engage in bloody atrocities like the Spanish Inquisition or the Crusades to force their religious belief on others.
A jaundiced view of things might conclude that this is the intent of the politically active religious zealots in today’s America. If so, it runs counter to everything this country was founded upon.
To avoid any misunderstanding, I’ll testify here and now that I believe in God and love Jesus as much as anyone. But I’ll resist any attempt by my government to force me to believe or tell me how to worship. Nor will I try to force the same on anyone else.
Both a life of faith and a decision not to believe are deeply personal and individual choices, and our system of government protects our right to choose. Realistically, no law can be written that will force the innermost human heart to believe, not to believe or how to believe. That is simply not government’s dominion.
Jesus himself articulated this separation of church and state best in Luke 17:21 when he told the Pharisees, “The kingdom of God is within you.”
It is not in the courthouse, nor in the Capitol building, the kingdom of God is within you. Thank you, Jesus and Jefferson for drawing that clear line!

Tim Walz was cooked was little remarked upon at the time, but in retrospect illustrates how he and his administration were sleeping through an enveloping crisis.
At the late 2024 budget forecast, he said disability and autism services were driving state government spending beyond expectations. When he was asked about potential fraud in the autism program — about which we’d reported an FBI investigation six months prior — he seemed unfamiliar. I traded texts with an incredulous reporter who was there and wound up publishing a column called, “Minnesota: an easy mark.” 
More recently, Walz faced the full force of the right-wing propaganda machine in the past two months. It was a frightening sight to behold, and a healthier democracy would never be host to such a parasitical malignancy.
Although restoring American democratic habits of mind to eviscerate that propaganda machine should be on our lengthy, long-term to-do list, the lesson here for me is that the most underrated tool in the political toolbox is … governing.
Deadly dull, I know, but the word governor even has the word “govern” in it: competently administering programs to help people who need it; ensuring Minnesota’s children are learning literacy and numeracy; and managing the state’s vast infrastructure assets. That’s the job.
Former St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, another one-time rising star in Minnesota politics, recently faced the same sort of governing reckoning as Walz, when Mayor Kaohly Her pulled off an upset November victory promising to make stuff work again. May Democratic elected officials everywhere take notice.
We live in perilous times, no question, but Minnesotans are right to expect a minimum level of competency in these matters of public administration. It’s especially important for the party of government, i.e., the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, to pay attention to details, like whether a 3,000% increase in spending on the autism program is reasonable, especially when some of the providers had ties to Feeding Our Future.
Tim Walz is at heart a decent man, and he doesn’t deserve what’s been thrown at him in recent weeks — especially a despicable allegation leveled by the president of the United States and the odious propagandist Nick Shirley that Walz was involved in the assassination of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman.
He made some mistakes, but he’s not evil, unlike some of the loudest and most influential voices in American politics today, whose greed and lust for power are boundless.
Walz’s first term was marked by almost constant crisis, none of it his doing. He was a mostly steady hand, even as Republicans came to despise him during the pandemic and the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd.
His second term comprised major legislative accomplishments — for which the credit mostly belongs to Hortman and the late Sen. Kari Dziedzic — as well as his (again, in retrospect) disastrous candidacy for vice president. All the while, thieves were stealing the people’s money with gusto.
Walz has served the community of Mankato, the people of Minnesota and his country.
And now he has saved us from what would have been a deeply divisive campaign, and which would have put the state of Minnesota under federal siege.
Unlike former President Joe Biden, who doomed his party and the country with his insistence on running for a second term, Walz is stepping aside before any more damage is done to his state and the DFL. He says he’ll focus all his energies on cleaning up the mess.
He deserves our thanks for that service and for making this decision.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)One of the biggest topics of 2025 for farmers, consumers and healthcare providers in North Carolina was whether raw milk should be legal to sell for human consumption. The battle, which  has been going on for years, could well resurface during the 2026 legislative session.
Raw milk has not undergone pasteurization, which is a process of heating the milk to a high temperature for a certain amount of time to kill pathogens like tuberculosis, which for centuries was frequently caused by drinking milk from cows with tuberculosis.   
Public health officials say foodborne illnesses like salmonella can also spread through consuming unpasteurized milk. Symptoms of these can include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. They can be especially severe in children.
Some people, however, say raw milk is healthier — a theory that’s been debunked by hundreds of studies — or that it tastes better. Others argue it’s an issue of personal liberty, claiming consumers have a fundamental freedom to decide what they and their families consume.

Robert Benor owns Benor Farm in Orange County’s Cedar Grove, a regenerative dairy with 12 cows and a herdshare.
Herdsharing is a practice similar to a CSA or farmshare, but it’s specific to dairy products. Consumers who want raw milk can buy a “share” of a dairy herd’s production, which sidesteps the legal issues over selling the milk itself. 
Benor says some of his customers have moved here from other states where the sale of raw milk is legal. “[They] say they can’t get used to the taste of pasteurized milk,” he said. “There’s others who are all natural and prefer raw milk.”
The cows, each bearing the name of something that goes with milk — for example, Milkshake, Nutmeg, Chocolate Chip, and Biscuit — live on the pasture at Benor Farm year round.
The number of herdshare members fluctuates throughout the year, but Benor says he provides raw milk to roughly a few hundred families and individuals. He also offers add-ons like butter, ricotta, yogurt, heavy cream, and fresh eggs from his chickens.

Benor milks the dairy cows every morning, sanitizing the equipment and storing the milk in a bulk tank that’s cleaned every 72 hours. 
“We focus a lot on sanitation and hygiene, so that we can make sure the milk is as safe as possible,” Benor told NC Newsline. 
But even the best sanitation can’t remove pathogens from unpasteurized milk -– a fact Davidson resident Pamela Breeckner knows from personal experience.
Breeckner told NC Newsline her father passed away years ago from tuberculosis contracted from drinking raw milk from a neighbor’s diseased cow. At the time, dangers related to unpasteurized milk weren’t as well known, and there were fewer regulations on its sale and consumption. 
“He was hospitalized or homebound for about 12 years before his death,” Breeckner said. “He was ill my whole life.”
The cow’s owners also passed away from tuberculosis, she said.
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler is in favor of banning the sale of raw milk outright. He said the topic has been an ongoing issue for many years. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza — a very infectious strain of bird flu — led to the latest push to ban raw milk. 
Bird flu has moved from wild birds and poultry to farm animals like dairy cattle. From there, it can spread to humans, leading to conditions like respiratory symptoms and pinkeye.
As of Dec. 17, a total of 71 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been identified in the U.S. since 2024, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. 
“[There were] dangers that had existed in the past, especially with bacterial growth in raw milk,” Troxler said. “But then when you throw in high-path avian influenza, then that is a different ball game.”
The controversial issue took the spotlight in North Carolina during debate over the state’s 2025 Farm Act, which passed the Senate and stalled in the House. 
An earlier draft of the bill would have closed the “pet milk” loophole in state law that allows the sale of unpasteurized milk. Under current law, the sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal, but it can legally be sold as “pet milk” for animal consumption. 
The measure was ultimately pulled from the bill because of protests from raw milk advocates. About 100 activists attended a hearing of the North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee in May, one of whom was arrested for attempting to bring a gun into the meeting.
Bill sponsor Sen. Brent Jackson, a Republican from Sampson County, said at that hearing he’d received thousands of text messages, phone calls, and emails in favor of raw milk consumption in North Carolina. 
“Until we filed this bill, sometimes you don’t know what’s out there,” he said. “But I’ve learned there is a tremendous amount of herdsharing going on in this state.”
Sampson did not allow the public to comment on the bill that day. But the committee voted against a total ban on the sale of raw milk.
Jackson’s staff did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment. 
Troxler isn’t giving up, though. He points to research like a 2017 study showing that unpasteurized dairy products can cause 840 times more illnesses and 45 times more hospitalizations than pasteurized products.
“From a public health standpoint, there is no reason to take that risk of contracting these illnesses when all you’ve got to do is have pasteurized milk,” Troxler told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0630-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:12:45.684998

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee Senate panel wants officers at a privately-run prison rocked by a 2025 riot to wear body cameras despite opposition from the state’s correction commissioner.
The State and Local Government Corrections Subcommittee recommended a pilot program Tuesday for the state’s private-prison contractor, CoreCivic, to equip detention officers at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center with body cameras in an effort to protect officers and inmates and provide clearer evidence for criminal investigations.
State Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson pointed out that prisons can be “extremely dangerous” because of a shortage of prison officers.
“Body cameras would keep everybody honest,” Jackson said.
CoreCivic President and CEO Patrick Swindle estimated the cost of putting cameras on Trousdale Turner officers at $350,000. 
Senators surmised that CoreCivic was willing to pay for the hardware, but a spokesperson said afterward the company hadn’t agreed to fund the equipment, only that it would work with the state on the policies it adopts.
Correction Commissioner Frank Strada, though, balked at the notion of putting body cameras on every prison officer in the state, saying it would cost $6 million for the equipment and $2 million to handle public records requests, including the expense of hiring attorneys and technology specialists to go through video frame by frame and blur people’s faces for privacy reasons. He did not have a cost estimate for a pilot project at Trousdale Turner.
“Body cameras would keep everybody honest,” said Jackson Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of a move to have private prison guards use the technology. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Instead, Strada told lawmakers the Department of Correction is putting together a central intelligence center in Nashville with nearly 30 employees using artificial intelligence to monitor prisoners. The department’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026-27 includes $8.6 million for technology upgrades.
The department also plans to spend $1.7 million to fly drones over facilities to stop contraband and phones from being smuggled into prisons. 
Strada raised privacy questions about video surveillance, mainly the constitutionality of having officers and inmates on video in cells, restrooms and other areas.
Lawmakers and a state attorney, though, said inmates lose some of their privacy rights when sent to prison.
Correction officials and CoreCivic leaders also challenged the concept of keeping body cameras turned on at all times, saying the amount of video is overwhelming for those who would monitor it or search for incidents. 
Swindle told lawmakers the company uses body cams at an Ohio prison but changed policy to allow officers to activate them only when they sense the need rather than keeping them on at all times.
Strada and a Correction Department lawyer also advised lawmakers the cost of hiring attorneys and technology experts would be extensive if cameras are rolling throughout an officer’s shift.
Lawmakers based their decision, in part, on the testimony of Wilson County District Attorney Jason Lawson, whose office handles Trousdale County cases, including those at the prison. 
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

Lawson told the committee body cameras would help with prosecution of prison cases by providing better evidence. He showed pictures of inmates attacking an officer at Trousdale and explained that cameras in the prison’s pods are located at each end of a hall and when video is enlarged it doesn’t give a clear look at people’s faces to identify them in court.
“This is one of those situations where a picture is worth a thousand words,” Lawson said.
Swindle told lawmakers that CoreCivic invested in safety and security measures and increased officers’ pay, which reduced vacancies and cut the turnover rate. In addition, the state moved gang members out of Trousdale Turner to state-run prisons.
A Trousdale Turner officer was stabbed and three inmates were treated for injuries in June 2025 when prisoners left their cells and gained access to an inner yard, destroyed property, set small fires and refused to take orders from staff.
The U.S. Department of Justice initiated a civil rights investigation at Trousdale Turner in 2024, citing a record of assaults, murders and understaffing at the facility since it opened in 2016. It is unclear whether the investigation is continuing.
The Department of Correction is seeking a $13 million contract increase for CoreCivic next year that would push the company’s total contracts to $243 million for running four prisons. The department also wants $3.5 million to go toward an increase in CoreCivic’s officer pay.

Officials with the Wood River Land Trust announced Dec. 30 they were part of a large, community effort to acquire the 2,700-acre Hailey Hot Springs Ranch for permanent conservation. 
The ranch, which was once the site of the historic Hailey Hot Springs Hotel in the 1800s, adds to the Hailey Greenway, a 3,000-acre, six mile stretch of protected land, officials said. 
“When the For Sale sign went up at the property, people were coming to us hoping that we could do something,” Wood River Land Trust Executive Director Amy Trujillo said in a written statement. “We knew it was going to take more than one organization to make this happen. Again and again over the course of the year, we have been amazed at the way people have come together – it’s a testament to how much people love this place and what we can do together.”
 Wood River Land Trust will now work to develop master plan for property

In its announcement, the Wood River Land Trust said more than 900 partners teamed up to acquire and protect the property. The list includes The Nature Conservancy, Blaine County Recreation District, Heart of the Rockies Initiative, Atira Conservation, 100 Men Who Care, the Wood River Women’s Foundation, Hailey Rotary Club, Spur Community Foundation, the Idaho Fish and Wildlife Foundation, The Rixon-Cronin Charitable Trust, Power Engineers, the Kid Stand charitable initiative and numerous families. 
In 2025, officials with the Wood River Land Trust had announced they launched a campaign to raise $16 million to buy the property.

With the property acquisition complete, officials with the Wood River Land Trust said they will begin working on a master plan for the property and anticipate seeking public comment and involvement in developing the master plan in the spring. 
Supporters are seeking to protect wildlife habitat for sage grouse, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, sandhill cranes and elk on the land, as well as preserve public access, the Wood River Land Trust said. 
“Protecting Hailey Hot Springs Ranch has been the top priority of the Land Trust since its founding by community members over 30 years ago,” officials with the Wood River Land Trust wrote in a press release Dec. 30. “The acquisition adds to the Hailey Greenway, which is now a 3,000‐acre, six‐mile stretch of connected open space encompassing the Colorado Gulch Preserve, Draper Wood River Preserve, Simons/Bauer Preserve, and the new Hailey Hot Springs Ranch Preserve. The protected land now extends through riverfronts and riparian forests, wetlands, sagebrush steppe, and high-desert alpine ecosystems, where it links with thousands of acres of public land beyond.”
  Plans call for reopening Hailey Hot Springs to the public 

Although there is public access to the ranch, access to the hot springs itself remains closed for now, officials said. However, officials with the Wood River Land Trust said their plans call for reopening the hot springs to the public.

“An exciting part of this project is the opportunity to reopen public access to the hot springs,” the Wood River Land Trust said in its press release. “The springs are located in a sensitive area, and the land trust and the Blaine County Recreation District will be developing a plan to provide a long-term solution that provides safe and accessible hot spring access for the public away from the sensitive wildlife area. Thus, for now, the hot spring will remain closed to the public until that can be developed.”

No more “World News Tonight.” No “Dancing With the Stars.” The “9-1-1” drama franchises gone, all of them. And no – clutch the pearls – SEC football on Saturday afternoons.
Then imagine if folks at Sinclair told unhappy viewers that if they wanted to keep watching ABC, they could just stream it. And that they should be satisfied with a grab bag of less expensive programming filling the gaping holes in its schedule.
Ridiculous, you say. But that’s exactly what might happen at Arkansas PBS, where the installation of former Republican state legislator Carlton Wing as executive director has resulted in the inexplicable decision to drop its PBS affiliation and rebrand as something called Arkansas TV, which few people will watch and even fewer people will support financially.
The state of Arkansas has spent 60 years and tens of millions of dollars building a public television network with statewide reach, one of the gems of our media landscape. But starting in July, programs from PBS – which make up the bulk of the content now available on the network’s four channels – will no longer be broadcast in the state. Arkansas is the first state in the union to make that move.
No more “PBS News Hour.” No “Sesame Street.” No “Antiques Roadshow.” No “American Experience,” or Ken Burns documentaries. The PBS KIDS channel – which provides vital educational programming serving lower-income households that lack high-speed internet access needed to stream content – will go dark at the whim of Wing, who has no background in public broadcasting.
The disaffiliation, easily ratified by the Arkansas Educational Television Commission now packed with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ appointees, was one of the first moves Wing took after leaving the Legislature to take the helm of Arkansas PBS in September.
His reasoning? At $2.3 million a year, PBS programming is just too expensive because a different pack of Republican ideologues in Congress dismembered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that underwrote the cost – an excuse that quickly dissolves when subjected to even slight scrutiny.
The notion that we can’t possibly find $2.3 million for a resource that serves 3 million Arkansans, at a cost of just 77 cents per resident per year, is rather laughable in a state now frittering away $300 million a year on voucher subsidies for private and homeschool students, a program that serves fewer than 47,000 families.
Rather than reaching out to wealthy donors to fill the gap, or seeking funding from charitable foundations, or finding more corporate underwriting, or lobbying for additional state funding, or even pushing Arkansas’ congressional delegation to reverse the decision to whack federal funding, Wing simply threw in the towel. It’s a move that was both lazy and unimaginative.
Disaffiliating from PBS should have been an absolute last resort when all other options had failed.
Contrast this with the approach of Arkansas’ three public radio stations, all of which also lost CPB support and none of which decided to drop NPR content. Indeed, they are working hard to find additional long-term, sustainable financial support to make up the gap.
Wing has said the disaffiliation decision had to be made now to avoid paying additional fees to PBS for not meeting a Jan. 1 deadline. PBS officials deny that claim, and it also ignores the fact that there would be no rationale at all for disaffiliation if other options had been successfully pursued.
Indeed, Arkansas PBS viewers showed their passion and commitment by coughing up $500,000 in the months after Congress cut CPB funding – an outpouring of support Wing has extinguished with his short-sighted decision to disaffiliate.
Wing ignores the effect this decision will have on the $3 million raised each year from viewers like you (more than the amount that he’s saving by eliminating PBS) that’s going to vanish like an Arkansas snowstorm.
Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network, made this point in June when she said that donations would “nosedive” without PBS because 80% of those who donate online cite its programming as their reason for giving money. The telethons that generate many of these donations are also, literally, built around PBS programming because these are the shows viewers care about and watch.
And here is where we truly go through the looking glass: Arkansas TV is telling current donors who get access to expanded content through the PBS Passport app that if they want to keep it, they will need to donate to PBS stations in surrounding states.
Thus, we are now actively encouraging money to flow out of Arkansas to support out-of-state stations. And if Wing thinks these people are also going to donate to Arkansas TV, he’s lost touch with reality.
The other aspect of this scheme is Wing’s pledge to raise the amount of locally produced programming on the network from its current level – about 5.5% of the schedule – to 70%.
Arkansas TV insists that it can replace hours and hours of PBS programming with local content for just $500,000 a year. But a budget that meager won’t come anywhere close to producing the quantity or quality of content that PBS viewers and donors have come to expect.
This decision is the culmination of a long-term Republican project, dating back to the Reagan years, to dismantle public broadcasting. This dismantling is pushed by politicians who oppose the very idea of having even one tiny, government-supported, non-commercial voice, or who believe PBS programming is too “liberal” or “woke.” 
Republicans in Congress, including Arkansas’ entire delegation, voted to put Arkansas PBS’ head on the block. Wing has now wielded the axe. Viewers will flee, fundraising will dry up, and Arkansas TV will become an irrelevant white elephant. Arkansas will be poorer for it.
Wing’s folly was perhaps best summed up in a letter sent to him by Annette Herrington, who has served on the Arkansas PBS board for 14 years and voted against disaffiliation:
“There are multiple options for how to proceed because that is what public television systems are doing all over America. And with 78% of Arkansans supporting PBS content, viewers and donors definitely deserve our best efforts to find a solution for the people we serve,” she wrote. “I cannot understand how the only option presented after your first 70 days was to deny PBS content to all Arkansans.”

Shortly after launching a dramatic raid in which U.S. forces abducted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, President Donald Trump justified the action with a promise to revive Venezuela’s moribund oil industry. The country has by far the largest claimed reserves of crude oil in the world, accounting for almost a fifth of the planet’s remaining known crude oil, but its production has plummeted under Maduro, who has ruled the country since 2013.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in which he announced Maduro’s capture.
This intervention comes at a pivotal moment for the global oil industry, which continues to stare down the prospect of a broad transition to renewable energy. For this reason, it’s not obvious that future markets can justify a surge of investment in Venezuela. On one hand, the country’s extra-heavy crude oil is perfect for diesel and jet fuel, which are helpful in hard-to-decarbonize industries. This makes it less threatened by the meteoric rise of electric vehicles displacing gasoline-powered cars. On the other hand, the world is already experiencing an overall glut of oil, and analysts expect demand to peak in the next decade. While there are buyers for additional oil that could be pumped in Venezuela — some of them on the U.S. Gulf Coast — experts say a total revival on the order that Trump is promising may not be in the cards.
“There’s a guaranteed market for it, but a market that has its limitations in size,” said Antoine Halff, the founder of the climate and data analysis firm Kayrros and a nonresident fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.
As electric vehicles and renewable energy continue to expand, the world appears to be approaching a peak in oil demand. While the exact timing of that peak is disputed — it could happen within four years or in more than 15 years — almost all analysts agree that it is coming. At that point, there may no longer be sufficient demand to keep exploiting new oil fields, no matter how large. And given that it will take many years just to update the infrastructure that will allow for increased oil production in Venezuela in the first place, investors may decide that the juice is not worth the squeeze.
Then there’s the matter of predicting future prices in a notoriously volatile industry. Oil companies only make a profit when global oil prices stay above a certain level. For the U.S. companies that produce oil from Texas shale, for example, that number is around $60 a barrel, which is close to the current benchmark price. For Saudi Arabia, it’s closer to $90 a barrel, because oil revenues back almost all the kingdom’s government spending. In the newest oil fields, such as those offshore of Guyana, it’s as low as $30. There are already concerns that an oversupply of oil worldwide could send prices tumbling over the next year, making new fields less palatable to investors. If demand plateaus, a surge of Venezuelan crude would push prices even further down. Since Venezuela is a member of OPEC, it would have to coordinate production along with Saudi and other major producers, who would likely prevent Venezuela from flooding the market.
Even so, there will likely be long-term demand for the specific kind of oil that Venezuela produces. That’s because any energy transition will not happen at equal speed across all parts of the transportation sector. The expansion of electric vehicles will first replace passenger cars and mopeds, which rely on lighter oil from fields like those of the Texas shale. Larger vehicles like airplanes and heavy-duty trucks are harder to replace — they need more power than EV batteries can feasibly provide at present — and they rely on heavy oil like Venezuela’s. A report from the oil trading firm Vitol found that “the initial pace of decline [for diesel] is expected to be slow compared to gasoline, but begins to gather pace from 2035 onwards.” Few other countries boast the same kind of extra-heavy reserves that Venezuela has, and those that do, like Canada, have much higher production costs.
“These are the hard-to-abate segments,” said Halff. “It’s the part of oil demand that looks like it’s not going to shrink quickly.”
Venezuela pumped more than 3 million barrels of oil per day at the turn of the century, but production totals have plummeted since then. After the government of Hugo Chávez nationalized major oil infrastructure in 2007, the United States imposed financial sanctions that forced Venezuela to sell its oil at steep discounts. Under the Maduro government, the state-owned oil company racked up debts and saw an exodus of skilled workers. Pumps and pipelines decayed out of service, storage tanks collapsed, and production bottomed out at around 500,000 barrels per day during the COVID-19 pandemic.
President Trump has promised that his aggressive raid on Venezuela will lead to a revival of this industry, and he has reportedly urged U.S. oil producers to aid him in the effort. In remarks following the Maduro raid, he promised that American companies would return to Venezuela and help export oil to other countries. Given how inefficient the state-run oil sector has become, analysts believe it would be easy to restore some production in the short term with outside investment and sanctions relief.
“Our assumption is that there are a lot of wells that just need a workover,” said Adrian Lara, the lead analyst for the Latin American oil industry at the research firm Wood Mackenzie, in a brief published last month before Maduro’s capture. “You can boost production through opex [operational expenditure], without needing much new capex [capital expenditure]” — in other words, a tune-up rather than a full surge of new investment.
In the short term, there is ample demand. The oil in the country’s vast Orinoco Belt is very heavy and viscous, like molasses, in contrast to U.S. shale oil, which is about as thin as vinegar. This makes it more expensive and more carbon-intensive to produce, but also makes it well suited for conversion into diesel fuel in trucks and for other uses like asphalt. There are several refineries along the Gulf Coast that were built to process this kind of heavy crude, and these refineries are operating below capacity. Right now, Venezuela exports most of its oil to China, which would also likely purchase more for its own refineries. An industry expert who spoke to The Wall Street Journal said access to those reserves could be a “game changer” in terms of increasing Gulf Coast refiners’ profits.
“Right now there’s plenty of appetite for heavy crude globally,” said Robert Auers, a refined fuels market analyst at the energy consultancy RBN Energy. “Even if Venezuelan production were to come back real strong, the global market could easily absorb that.”
But a grand revival like the one Trump has promised would be a much taller order, given that it would take decades to unfold. The energy analysis firm Rystad Energy projects that a return to pre-Maduro levels would require an investment of $110 billion, and these investments would not bear fruit for a decade or more. Even Chevron, the only U.S. oil producer that operates in the country, would need to invest an estimated $7 billion in order to add another 500,000 barrels, according to a former executive who spoke with The New York Times.
The climate pollution stemming from this crude might also play a factor in its market appeal. Right now, the heavy oil extraction in the Orinoco Belt is some of the most carbon-intensive in the world, in part because enormous amounts of methane are flared during the process. As governments continue to pursue Paris Agreement targets, however fitfully, they might shy away from such fields wherever possible and instead import lower-carbon barrels. (The European Union has already committed to do this.) Many experts believe that oil majors will hesitate before taking the plunge on a resource that is far tougher to handle than the crude in U.S. shale fields or the Middle East.
That’s all in addition to the political uncertainty that has followed Trump’s attempt to depose Maduro. It remains unclear what shape the new government of Venezuela will take. Given that other producers like Exxon Mobil lost billions of dollars when the Chávez government nationalized their assets, it’s far from obvious that these oil companies would want to invest under continued political instability. Past U.S. interventions have demonstrated similar dynamics: Oil production in Libya has still not recovered since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and it took almost a decade for Iraqi oil production to rebound after the U.S. invaded in 2003.
“I do not believe in a significant increase in the short term,” said Rudolf Elias, chair of the supervisory board of Staatsolie, the state oil company of Suriname, which is pursuing an offshore oil project in the waters east of Venezuela. “It will take years before the industry is revived … then it is dirty oil, and heavy, so it will not be first in the row.”

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/LAI)More than half of adults in Louisiana have experienced physical violence during their lifetime but what those acts look like largely depends on the victim’s gender, according to an annual survey conducted last year. 
In Louisiana, gun violence is much more likely to be carried out against men, while severe  intimate partner violence — sometimes referred to as domestic abuse — is much more likely to happen to women, showed the result of a study by Tulane University, the University of California San Diego and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
“Violence is a gendered issue. It is different if you are a man or a woman or a boy or a girl,” Anita Raj, executive director of the Newcomb Institute at Tulane University and the study’s lead author, said in an interview. 
Raj’s survey, the Louisiana Study on Violence Experiences Across the Lifespan, is the only comprehensive research of its kind conducted in the state. It was administered online in English and Spanish between May 13 and June 18, 2025, to more than 1,000 Louisiana residents 18 and older. 
The survey shows Louisiana residents experience violence at an alarmingly high rate. Eight percent of people surveyed said they were subjected to physical violence in the past year, including 3% who said they were threatened with either a knife or a gun.

Who commits the violence and what form it takes largely depends on the victim’s gender. 

Over half of women (58%) who had experienced physical violence within a year of the survey reported their spouse or partner were responsible for the incidents, compared with just 14% of men. Most men (53%) who had experienced physical violence in that time period said they were targeted by a stranger, compared with just 5% of women, according to the report. 
Men were much more likely to be subjected to gun violence than women, however; 4% of men reported they had been threatened or attacked with a gun in the year before the survey was taken, compared with just 1% of women, according to the report.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Yet women (13%) were more likely to experience sexual harassment and sexual violence than men (6%). Almost one in four women (23%) surveyed also said they had been subjected to forced sex during their lifetimes, compared with 7% of men. 
Severe intimate partner violence, sometimes called domestic violence, was also much more prevalent for women. 

Almost 25% of women reported they had been subjected to potentially lethal forms of intimate partner violence — such as choking, suffocation, burns, beatings and use of a weapon — during their lifetimes. Only 6% of men reported being the victims of life-threatening violence from a spouse or dating partner. 
Mariah Wineski, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said the study’s findings align with what domestic violence shelters and other victim advocacy groups see on a daily basis. 

“Many times, the most dangerous place for a woman is in her home or in her relationship,” Wineski said. 

Intimate partner violence is more widespread among younger people. Twelve percent of respondents who are 18-24 years old and 15% of those ages 25-34 experienced violence and controlling behavior from a partner in the year before the survey was taken. Only 1-2% over people 55 and older reported the same problem. 
Raj and Wineski said prevention programs aimed at reducing intimate partner violence need to start with adolescents in order to have the greatest impact. 
“It is much more effective to change the attitudes and beliefs of a child or adolescent,” Wineski said. “They are at a better place in their lives for learning all sorts of new things, including how to interact with other people.”
Programs that promote economic stability and lift people out of poverty also help curb violence, according to Raj’s report. 
Survey participants who reported not having enough money for food or other basic necessities were five times more likely to have experienced physical violence in the past year and six times more likely to experience intimate partner violence. People who are homeless were nine times more likely to experience intimate partner violence, according to the report. 
“Policies that expand women’s economic and political participation, promote safety in workplaces and public spaces, and protect LGBTQ+ people advance not only equity but also safety for all,” the report concluded.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PXL_20240223_230001247-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:12:45.684998

This includes the prices for prescription drugs. Thankfully, there is a bipartisan proposal in Congress to address these costs led by Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo.

From the newsroom of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee: “U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho., and Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., recently introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act to fix market distortions and increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs to lower patient costs at the pharmacy counter.”
This is a bipartisan attempt to bring down the costs of prescription medications for patients in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
As background, manufacturers do not set the final price of their drugs. Pharmaceutical pricing goes through a series of steps before drugs actually reach patients. Depending on whether people buy their prescription drugs directly from a pharmacy or through their insurance, several transactions and multiple layers of profit are built into the system.
In general, manufacturers sell to wholesalers who then sell to pharmacies. Most, if not all, insurance companies use pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate the best pricing from manufacturers. Drug wholesalers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers provide a service, but this comes at an added cost to the consumer.
Wholesalers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers will argue that they obtain better prices from manufacturers, but these contracts and the supposed benefits are not transparent. Actual contract pricing and rebates are usually closely guarded and not readily available to the public
What is known is that Pharmacy Benefit Manager companies, in general, have higher profit margins than drug manufacturers. Drug wholesalers and pharmaceutical benefit managers may have a role in the drug market, but only if they add value for patients. Their contracts and pricing should be transparent, so consumers can decide the amount of value added.
According to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee’s press release, the PBM Price Transparency and Accountability Act would:

“Delink PBM compensation from their negotiated rebates to disincentivize PBMs from promoting higher-priced medications;
Increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and empower Part D plan sponsors to audit their PBM for compliance with contract requirements;
Reinforce existing requirements that plan sponsors contract with any willing pharmacy that meets their standard contract terms and conditions to better protect independent pharmacies in rural areas from practices that have contributed to widespread closures;
Require participation by retail community pharmacies in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) survey, which would ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies; and
Mandate PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies to ensure transparent drug costs for states and taxpayers.”

The lack of price knowledge in our health care system is a fundamental problem for patients who want to make informed medical decisions. The Senate Finance Committee is to be congratulated for attempting to make Pharmacy Benefit Managers responsible for holding down pharmaceutical costs.
Hopefully, the full Senate will take up the legislation in a timely fashion.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)Republicans appear to have narrowly held a state House seat representing Dorchester County in a special election a week ahead of the Legislature’s return.
Unofficial results show Republican Greg Ford just 21 votes ahead of Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani.
With all 22 precincts reporting late Tuesday, Ford had 50.2% of the vote to Ogletree Satani’s 49.6%, sending the race to an automatic recount. In South Carolina, a recount is required if less than 1 percentage point separates the candidates.
The 3,442 ballots cast represented 14% of the district’s registered voters. Special elections are typically low-turnout races. But the results were surprisingly close for a seat that had long been considered safely Republican.
The special election was triggered by the departure of Rep. Chris Murphy. The former House Judiciary chairman submitted his resignation in August, but it didn’t take effect until Monday. The state law he cited in his “irrevocable resignation” allowed the special election timeline to proceed while he was still technically in office.
First elected in 2010, Murphy replaced GOP Rep. Annette Young, who didn’t seek re-election after 20 years in the House.
Both Ford and Ogletree Satani defeated two opponents in their primaries.
Once certified by the state Election Commission, the winner will face re-election in November for a full term.
Ogletree Satani previously ran against Murphy in 2024. That vote wasn’t nearly as close: Murphy won re-election by 14 percentage points.
Tuesday’s special election marked the fourth for a Statehouse seat since the 2025 legislative session ended.
Three elections were held Dec. 23, all in ruby red districts. In the only race that day with a Democrat on the ballot, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger won with 62% of the vote to replace ex-Rep. RJ May, who is set to be sentenced next week after pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
In the Upstate, former Sen. Lee Bright returns to the seat he lost in 2016 representing parts of Spartanburg and Greenville counties; and Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher with the backing of the hardline Freedom Caucus, will represent a Greenville County seat in the House.
If the results in the Dorchester County race are finalized this week, the legislative session will start Tuesday with all 170 seats filled.

The shelter location will rotate between six churches over the next nine weeks. (Photo courtesy of Caroline Wilson) In Martinsburg, six churches are teaming up with a local nonprofit organization to shelter homeless people during the coldest weeks of the year. 
The Cold Weather Shelter officially opened Saturday at Christ Reformed United Church of Christ in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The location of the shelter will rotate each week to a different Martinsburg church over the next nine weeks. It will be open from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
“Right now we’ve got six churches covering the nine weeks,” said Caroline Wilson, a social worker for WVU Medicine and one of the shelter project’s organizers. “So everything gets in the back of the truck on Saturday and goes to the next place.”
Shelter coordinator Hannah Cooper said as of Monday, the shelter had housed eight people. Staff expect more people in the coming days as word about the shelter spreads. 
“We’ve had quite a few individuals come in, and we’ve been able to help them in numerous ways, not only just having them stay there overnight, but also connecting them with the appropriate referral services for some needs they have,” Cooper said. 
The shelter will be staffed and operated by the Martinsburg Initiative. It will house up to 20 people per night. While the Eastern Panhandle has homeless shelters, Wilson said this one will be different because it won’t require people to participate in any programs in order to use the shelter. It will be open to anyone age 18 and order.

Wilson said a warming center or winter shelter was identified as a community need three years ago, and the shelter finally came to fruition this year. 
“The fact is, even though we do have some housing resources, there are still people sleeping outside,” Wilson said. “So we identified that we needed something that was low-barrier that people could go to when it was cold. Because we’ve had deaths across the state over the past few years, not a lot, but some people have died out in the cold. And we would definitely not want to see that happen here.”
Wilson said the project gained momentum when she connected with the Martinsburg Initiative and Rev. Sherry Miller, pastor of St. John’s Lutheran Church in Martinsburg. 
“Basically about six months or so ago we were able to form the right team of one nonprofit executive director, which is Margaret from the Martinsburg initiative, one pastor who was really passionate about this project, which is Sherry Miller, and then me, a social worker who was really passionate about homelessness,” Wilson said. “And so we kind of started working on this and pulling in churches and working towards funding and all of that.”
Miller said she’s wanted to find a way for her church to house homeless people since a 17-degree day during her first winter with the congregation, three years ago. 
Miller pulled in support from the churches, and the Martinsburg Initiative took on the staffing, insurance and liability needed for the shelter. 
“It really has just been amazing how this team of three have been able to get this off and running,” Miller said. 
The WATTS shelter in Winchester, Virginia and one in Charles Town — both that rotate between churches — became the models for Martinsburg’s cold weather shelter project, she said. 
The project is funded by the city of Martinsburg and has received other grants. 
Miller said the key to getting churches on board was having the nonprofit organization running the shelter take on the associated liability. Many parishes have older buildings that people put lots of time and energy into to take care of them, she said.
“The first thing is that the nonprofit status is through the Martinsburg Initiative, so that once they come into a church, then the church has no liability, because the nonprofit takes over,” Miller said. “And so that is the first hurdle for churches. And I really try to make sure that they’re aware of that.”
Miller said she also encourages churches to participate in order to fulfill Jesus’ command to care for their neighbors. Homelessness has increased in West Virginia and in the United States in recent years. Miller said the number of homeless people is only going to increase as the cost of living and rent increases, she said.

“We need to love our neighbor and support those who are marginalized, and churches need to get back to the basics on that,” she said. 
Wilson said she hopes other communities can adopt the same rotating location model. 
Cooper said it may take several volunteers to change locations each week, but she’s prepared to have as many or few who show up. 
“It’s just, how easy is it going to make it for the people that are moving the shelter every week and how fatigued they may get from doing it,” she said. “So I really want to have that nice range of volunteers so nobody gets overly fatigued trying to work it all by themselves.”
The shelter is also looking for volunteer help with laundry each week, she said.

(Photo: Gabrielle Nelson/Buffalo’s Fire)Tennessee soybean farmers are still facing tough decisions ahead of the next growing season as they await aid from the federal government meant to offset substantial losses from 2025. 
Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council, described 2025 as a “trifecta” of inflation, extreme weather and unstable trade amid tariff negotiations. The University of Tennessee estimated in August that the state’s soybean farmers would see a combined $110 million in losses in 2025.
Disruption of trade with China, the number one purchaser of U.S.-grown soybeans in the world, ratcheted up pressure on soybean producers nationwide. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to start issuing one-time assistance payments at the end of February for commodity crop farmers who experienced trade market disruptions and increased production costs.
Eligible soybean farmers will receive $30.88 per acre, with a limit of $155,000 per producer. The USDA is also issuing payments for multiple other commodity crops based on acreage. The department released payment rates for each eligible crop on Dec. 31.
“Farmers are very appreciative of this, and we believe it’s a good first step, but overall, the payments will not make up for the losses,” Maupin said. “The inflation in the input products has still driven all of the cost to put in a crop to extremely high levels. The prices have improved on soybeans some, but certainly not to the levels they were before 2024.”
This means soybean farmers are, for now, still anticipating losing money on each acre they plant, he said.
Maupin has heard of some farmers who decided not to put in a crop this year, and many are still trying to make decisions for the upcoming season.
“The farmers, being the eternal optimists that they are, are hoping that they will have a good growing season and that the yields of their crops will be high and that they will help compensate for these high input costs and moderate prices,” Maupin said.
But another tough year may be too much to weather.
“There will be farmers that financially can try one more year, and they’ve indicated that they will, but that’s just not the case for everybody,” he said.

The remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty crops, sugar and other commodities not covered in the Farmer Bridge Assistance program.
Payments are calculated using farmers’ 2025 planted acreage reports. To be eligible, producers must have an adjusted gross income less than $900,000. 
The USDA will begin issuing payments on Feb. 28.

(Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Tennessee’s infant mortality rate has dipped since 2019 but remains significantly and persistently higher than the national average, a new report published by the state’s health department found.
Black families in Tennessee continue to experience the heartbreak of losing a baby in the first year of life at twice the rate of white families, a stubborn disparity linked to maternal health, preterm births and access to prenatal care, among other factors. 
West Tennessee had some of the highest rates of infant mortality: 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births. Knox County had the lowest at 3.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. 
Overall, Tennessee’s infant mortality rate of 6.5 deaths per 1,000 live births was 16% higher than the national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. The report focuses on 2023 birth outcomes.
The 2023 infant deaths were largely a result of medical conditions, including preterm and low-birth-weight deliveries, and congenital disease. 
But unsafe sleeping practices, such as putting a baby to sleep on its belly, outside of a crib or bassinet or with blankets and stuffed animals that can potentially lead to suffocation, remained a significant factor in infant deaths. Sleep-related deaths claimed the lives of one in four babies between 2019 and 2023, the report found. Nearly four in five sleep-related deaths were deemed “preventable” by teams of experts who review child deaths.
The report makes a series of recommendations to combat Tennessee’s high rates of infant deaths. They include promoting safe sleep practices, smoking cessation programs and increasing awareness of prenatal services offered by public health departments.

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)It has been a difficult year for Maryland businesses. This is especially true for the many businesses that do business with the federal government. They have faced disruptions caused by federal reductions in force (RIFs) as well as sweeping changes in federal contracting and procurement policies. Companies have also been affected by an increase in tariff rates. And some state taxes have increased as well.
I and my colleagues have just completed a detailed survey to assess where Maryland businesses stand as we head toward the end of 2025. The survey asked respondents about this past year’s performance relative to 2024, their outlook over the next six months, the impact of federal policy changes, and their views of Maryland as a place to do business. Respondents also provided open-ended comments, and these attest to the very human costs behind the topline findings.
Overall, the survey paints a picture of a business community under pressure from rising costs and shifting federal and trade policies. Performance in 2025 was weaker than in 2024 for about half the firms in our sample of more than 90 companies. Still, many are cautiously optimistic about the next six months.
Rising costs remain a major challenge: roughly 80% of respondents reported higher costs, and most expect the trend to continue. These cost pressures have translated into higher prices. When asked to identify the most significant challenge of 2025, respondents highlighted rising costs, federal policy disruptions, and weak sales. As one put it, “The Maryland economy now faces unprecedented challenges and struggle, compounded by electricity price surges and costs.”

Federal policy changes have been especially disruptive. Many firms – particularly those heavily involved in federal contracting – reported negative impacts from RIFs and from changes in procurement and contracting policies. Staffing cuts have delayed payments and created administrative bottlenecks. One firm noted: “Contract officers are untrained, payments for services rendered are delayed, putting financial strain on small businesses.”
In some cases, contracts, grants and anticipated solicitations have been canceled altogether: “Federal contracting has almost completely dried up for us. Option years have been canceled or significantly de-scoped for most of our multi-year contracts.” However, a small number of respondents did report positive outcomes, most often in the aerospace and defense sector.
Other policy-related impacts also surfaced in the comments. The termination of programs supporting minority and economically disadvantaged businesses, as well as environmental initiatives, was noted repeatedly. One firm wrote: “We feel as if we are now working against our own federal government, which is trying to kill the solar industry.” Another pointed to the erosion of protections for socially/economically disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses. Respondents also highlighted a trend toward contract bundling – the practice of combining multiple contracts into fewer, larger awards – which tends to favor large firms over small.
Trade policy has introduced its own set of pressures for firms. Many companies reported that new tariffs have raised the cost of imported inputs and reduced supply chain reliability, although a few cited benefits from reduced foreign competition. Firms reported shifting sourcing countries, moving from international to domestic suppliers, and stockpiling critical inputs to manage disruptions.
Finally, we asked about Maryland’s business environment. Many firms view it unfavorably, and some reported having considered relocating to another state. High taxes, high operating costs, and housing affordability were top concerns. One respondent captured the sentiment bluntly: “Maryland is not a business-friendly state. We are at the point we can no longer afford the taxes that continue to go up and up.”
The recent increase in the sales and use tax on data and IT services was cited by several firms: “The 3% Technology Tax makes it difficult to compete with firms in VA, DE, and PA that do not have such a burden.” If there is a silver lining, it is that minority-owned businesses were somewhat less likely to view Maryland as unhospitable.
The survey does not suggest a uniformly dire situation, and many firms remain optimistic about the months ahead. Maryland’s talent base and proximity to federal agencies continue to be viewed as advantages. However, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the state has pressing structural issues that require urgent attention. Maryland businesses also need to adapt to a new reality of changed federal policies and priorities. Our finding that policy disruptions are hitting some firms much harder than others points to how support can be appropriately targeted while firms adjust to the new reality.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/open-1.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:13:08.480832

(Getty Images)The board that regulates optometrists in Kentucky has filed emergency regulations to address exemptions from licensure requirements it improperly granted some optometry graduates in recent years.
But the Dec. 31 regulations, which took effect immediately, are drawing fire from critics who say they do nothing to explain the past actions of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners or address whether optometrists who were exempted from mandatory exams are qualified to continue providing eye care to patients.
“Our focus has always been on patient safety,” Dr. Jill Bryant, executive director of the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, or NBEO, said in an email. “We are deeply concerned that the people of Kentucky are still receiving treatment from improperly licensed optometrists who have never demonstrated that they can successfully pass national competency assessments — and, in some instances, have repeatedly failed those assessments.”
The regulation allows any optometry graduate from 2020-2023 who has not passed all required licensure exams to do so by 2027. 
The board began granting waivers to testing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing travel and other restrictions. It continued to approve exemptions after the COVID emergency had ended, including in December 2023.
The NBEO administers licensure exams for optometry graduates in all 50 states. The Kentucky Lantern reported in December that the national board had identified 21 optometrists in Kentucky who had gained licenses from 2020 through 2023 without passing “one or more” parts of the three-part national exam then required by state law.
Among them was Dr. Hannah Ellis, the daughter of former board president Dr. Joe Ellis, a prominent Kentucky optometrist active in state and national optometry circles. He abruptly resigned from the board last month and has not responded to requests for comment.
Several of the optometrists who had not met all requirements, including Hannah Ellis, were graduates of the University of Pikeville College of Optometry, which opened in 2016 as Kentucky’s only optometry school.
Patient safety ‘forgotten?’
The state board has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Lantern and has made little public comment apart from two brief statements on its website, the most recent  announcing the emergency regulations.
The board “feels strongly that all licensees should possess the skills and knowledge to be granted a license,” the Dec. 31 statement said in part.
Questionable testing waivers put KY’s licensing of optometrists under scrutiny

But the emergency regulations fall short of that goal, according to the Kentucky Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, which represents medical doctors who specialize in eye care. In a statement, it called for “full transparency” from the state board in addressing the matter.
“We are concerned that they do not have a plan to address the educational shortfalls of those optometrists who could not pass the nationally standardized licensure tests — at least some of whom are performing surgical procedures on Kentucky patients,” the academy said in a statement.
Optometrists hold a four-year doctorate of optometry degree and following a 2011 lobbying blitz at the Kentucky General Assembly, won a broad expansion of their scope of practice including the right to perform some eye surgeries. The NBEO has described it as “one of the broadest scopes of practice in the United States.”
Dr. William “Chip” Richardson, a Georgetown ophthalmologist and former president of the academy, said he is “frankly disheartened” by the board’s proposed solution that appears to allow optometrists who have not met professional standards to continue treating patients. He also believes the new regulations water down requirements.
“What’s sadly forgotten here is patient safety,” he said in an email.
‘Kind of puzzled’
A key legislator also wants further information from the state board, including why it granted exemptions for some candidates and whether they hold a valid license to treat patients.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, (LRC Public Information)
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield and chair of the Senate Health Services Committee, said he expects to seek answers from the board through his committee during the legislative session that convened Tuesday.
“I’m still kind of puzzled by it all,” Meredith said. “We need to know what’s going on.”
Meredith sought the Oct. 1 Kentucky attorney general’s opinion that found the state board circumvented state law by authorizing exemptions for licensure through board actions rather than through enacting new regulations.
It directed the board to review the licensure of all optometrists granted licenses with such exemptions.
Meredith said he’s also concerned that the former board president’s daughter was among those granted exemptions and plans to inquire about that.
“That’s obviously a conflict of interest,” he said.
The emergency regulations state they are in response to the attorney general’s opinion. 
It found that the board “acted beyond its authority” in waiving some requirements for licensure, instead allowing “alternative testing” it did not detail. The opinion added that “any person who applied for a license to practice optometry using the waiver and alternative testing did not comply with the relevant regulations.”
While the board has acknowledged waiving Part 3 of the exam, an in-person testing of clinical skills with patients — citing restrictions of the pandemic — it has remained silent about any other exemptions.
The Lantern identified at least six instances when the board acted on exemptions to testing — including an apparent decision in December 2023, after the COVID emergency had ended — to waive Part 1 of the exam.
Board minutes state without elaboration that some optometry school graduates unable to pass Part 1 “will be allowed licensure with additional educational requirements.” Part 1, which focuses on science and medical knowledge, is considered the hardest of the exam’s three parts.
Last year, the state board enacted a regulation allowing Kentucky licensure candidates to substitute the Canadian exam, considered easier to pass, saying in written comments that some optometry graduates were unable to pass Part 1 of the national exam.
 Duty to ‘protect the public’

The new regulations state that optometry graduates from 2020 through 2023 must show that they have passed either Part 1 of the national exam or the Canadian exam before they renew their licenses in 2027.
Kentucky optometrists keep campaign cash flowing to the powerful in Frankfort

Also, they must pass Part 2 of the national exam, which tests a candidate’s skills at diagnosis and treatment.
And they must pass either Part 3 of the national exam, which tests how well a candidate performs in treating people posing as patients — or it allows for candidates to pass a new, Kentucky version of the test to be developed specifically for those candidates previously exempted.
 The emergency regulations say that all affected licensees will be notified by Jan. 15 of the requirements.
The Kentucky Optometric Association released a statement in support of the new regulation but called for the changes to be implemented “in a transparent manner to ensure that public safety and licensee qualifications are never called into question.”
The board’s Dec. 31 statement provides no details of how the board reached a decision, developed the emergency regulations or whether it took a vote on them.
The board met in December but made no public comment or what members discussed in a closed session. 
It has never responded to the NBEO which in a May 23, 2025 letter said that it had identified 21 optometrists in Kentucky who appear to have been granted a license without having passed “one or more” parts of the three-part national exam.
The Dec. 31 statement on the Kentucky board’s website said the board acknowledged it did not use the “correct regulatory process” during the COVID-19 emergency when it temporarily waived the requirement that candidates pass Part 3 of the national exam. It makes no mention of waiving Part 1.
However, all candidates seeking to renew licenses must show by 2027 that they have met all requirements, it said, stating:
“The duty of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners is to license qualified optometrists as well as protect the public, and the current board members are committed to executing this responsibility.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2210182104-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 05:56:55.245249

(Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)A Wisconsin Assembly committee held a public hearing Tuesday on a bill that would require the state to hold an annual hunt of sandhill cranes. 
The sandhill crane was once nearly extinct and its recovery is seen as a conservation success story. Similar to the return of the wolf, the growth of the sandhill crane population has caused a long running political debate in Wisconsin. For years, Republicans in the Legislature have been pushing for a sandhill crane hunt — arguing the opening of recreational opportunities would benefit the state’s hunting industry and advocating for eating the birds’ meat. 
The proposal this session stems from a legislative study committee commissioned last summer which examined how to mitigate damage caused by the birds to the state’s farm fields and the possibility of holding a hunt. Estimates say that each year the birds cause almost $2 million in crop damage, mostly to corn seeds that are eaten before they can sprout. 
In the initial version of the bill proposed by the study committee, a number of provisions were included that would have directly addressed the crop damage. If a sandhill crane hunt is authorized, that would allow farmers to access money through an existing Department of Natural Resources damage abatement program, but otherwise all the farm-specific provisions have been removed from the version of the bill now being considered by the Assembly. 
If a bird is frequently damaging a farmer’s crops, a depredation permit is obtainable from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however federal law requires that the bird’s carcass not be consumed. 
Rep. Paul Tittl (R-Manitowoc), the bill’s author, said the bill is a “well thought out proposal to relieve farmers and promote new opportunities for hunters.” 
But Democrats on the committee and critics of the bill questioned why the specific farmer assistance programs were cut out, how a hunt would affect the crane population and how much establishing a hunt would cost the DNR. 
Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point) noted that the Republicans were simultaneously arguing that holding a hunt wouldn’t significantly impact the state’s crane population and that holding a hunt would help mitigate the crop damage caused by the birds. 
“If it’s not going to impact the population very much, then how do we protect farmers’ investment in seed and corn sprouts and potatoes and cranberries, if we’re not going to actually impact the population to the benefit of the farmer,” Miresse said. 
Taylor Finger, the DNR’s game bird specialist, said in his testimony that opening the existing crop damage abatement program up to sandhill crane damage without adding additional funds to the program would result in “worse outcomes for farmers seeking assistance.” 
Republicans on the committee largely questioned the testimony of sandhill crane researchers. Anne Lacy, director of eastern flyway programs at the Baraboo-based International Crane Foundation, said she is concerned about holding a hunt in Wisconsin because it is one of the few places on the continent where sandhill cranes breed. 
“I don’t think there is a [population] number that justifies a hunt,” Lacy said. “There are many states that hunt sandhill cranes, and they do it successfully. They’ve been managed for years, including this population. But Wisconsin is a breeding state, so that puts a different spin on a hunting season … So it’s not so much a number. It is how a hunt affects this bird because of its ecology.”
In an extended back and forth in which he raised his voice, Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) pushed Lacy to say she is supportive of sandhill crane hunts elsewhere. 
“All right, so I catch you dodging me, so therefore you do not personally support a hunt in any other state,” Sortwell said.

(Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)As Virginia lawmakers prepare to return to Richmond next week for the start of the 2026 General Assembly, Democratic officials across the state and congressional delegation are mounting a unified pushback against the U.S. military strike on Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, while Republicans have largely praised the operation as a long-overdue show of force.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, plans to file legislation ahead of the session that would restrict the federal government from deploying the Virginia National Guard to overseas conflicts like Venezuela — or using Guard troops in American cities — without clear legal authorization. 
“I’m a big believer that the Virginia National Guard should be used to support U.S. national security, but not to suppress the will of Americans or to support reckless adventurers overseas,” Helmer told The Mercury Tuesday. 
Helmer’s proposal comes as Democrats argue the strike represents an unconstitutional expansion of presidential war powers, even as Republicans contend it removed a dangerous authoritarian leader and strengthened U.S. security.
President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. forces had captured Maduro during a military operation inside Venezuela and that the United States would oversee a transition period in the country. 
Trump said the U.S. would “run the country” during the transition, remarks that drew immediate scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about executive overreach.
The operation involved U.S. military strikes and a special forces mission to detain Maduro, who has long been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges.  
Administration officials defended the action as necessary to disrupt drug networks and hold Maduro accountable after years of authoritarian rule.
 Helmer cites Guard authority, Venezuelan community as concerns mount

Trump’s announcement sent shockwaves through Washington and state capitals alike, including in Virginia, which is home to more than 9,000 Venezuelans, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimates. 
Many in that community fled political repression, economic collapse and violence under Maduro’s government, and have been closely following developments in their home country. Over 7.9 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have left the country “in search of protection and a better life,” according to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.
Helmer, a former Army officer who served multiple tours in Iraq, said the strike underscores the need for states to assert their own authority when federal officials bypass Congress and governors in deploying National Guard troops.

His legislation, he said, is rooted in personal experience and concern about unchecked military deployments. 
“I lost friends in a war twice in Iraq because politicians lack the courage to stand up and stop a war of choice,” Helmer said, adding that Congress has too often failed to assert its authority before service members are put in harm’s way.
Helmer emphasized that his proposal would require a legal review of certain National Guard deployments, demand disclosure of their scope and justification, and allow the Virginia attorney general to intervene if a deployment is deemed unlawful. 
The bill would also prohibit the use of state resources to mobilize the Virginia National Guard against Virginians, against other states, or to influence elections, while stopping short of blocking Guard missions that clearly serve U.S. national security interests.
He said the measure is designed to place guardrails within existing federal law and Supreme Court precedent, giving states greater leverage to challenge what he called reckless or politically motivated uses of military force.
 Democrats cite constitutional limits, warn of escalation

Virginia’s congressional Democrats echoed Helmer’s concerns, framing the Venezuela strike as part of a broader pattern of unilateral military action.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who has spent years pressing Congress to reclaim its constitutional role in authorizing war, condemned the strike as a return to failed interventionist policies.
“President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro — however terrible he is — is a sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere,” Kaine said in a statement.
Kaine warned that bypassing Congress makes it harder for the United States to demand respect for its own sovereignty and questioned where such actions could lead. He said it was “long past time” for Congress to reassert its authority over matters of war and peace.
Alongside Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Kaine filed a War Powers Resolution last month, seeking to block U.S. military hostilities against Venezuela without congressional authorization. That resolution is expected to come up for a vote next week.
U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the decision to use military force for regime change demands “the closest scrutiny,” particularly given the global implications.
Warner said that while Maduro is a corrupt authoritarian who has repressed his people and overseen stolen elections and mass displacement, those facts do not grant the president authority to ignore constitutional limits.
“If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan’s leadership?” Warner said, warning that such precedents invite instability and abuse by authoritarian regimes.

Warner also criticized what he called hypocrisy in the administration’s approach, noting that Trump recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, while claiming similar allegations justified military force in Venezuela.
In the House, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said he was “deeply concerned” by reports of U.S. military strikes and the capture of a foreign head of state.
Scott said the administration has yet to identify a clear legal basis for its actions in Venezuela or explain how long U.S. involvement could last.
“Escalating military action inside a sovereign country without congressional authorization raises serious questions under both U.S. and international law,” Scott said, adding that military force is among the least effective ways to address drug trafficking compared with education, prevention and addiction treatment.
U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, a ranking member of the Military and Foreign Affairs Oversight Subcommittee, said the administration’s actions amounted to illegal regime change rather than a legitimate counter-drug effort.
“President Trump said he’d be the ‘Peace President’ and wouldn’t start any new wars, and yet here he is illegally invading another country and kidnapping its President,” Subramanyam said, warning the move could lead to prolonged instability and another “forever war.”
 Republicans praise strike, with some urging caution

Republicans in Virginia largely offered a sharply different assessment, praising the operation as decisive and long overdue.
U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, whose district includes a large military population, said the operation demonstrated American resolve.
“The strength of the United States is rooted in the courage and dedication of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. That strength was on full display,” Kiggans said, thanking U.S. service members for carrying out what she described as a precise and successful mission to apprehend Maduro and disrupt narcotics trafficking.
U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland, a former Navy SEAL, also celebrated the strike, linking it to domestic concerns about drug overdoses and border security. He said Venezuela had become a proxy for U.S. adversaries and a source of instability that harmed American communities.

Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised Trump’s leadership in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying accountability for Maduro’s abuses “protects Americans first and foremost” and strengthens democracy and security across the Western Hemisphere.
Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is also set to leave office next week, welcomed Maduro’s arrest, writing that it was “wonderful for the Venezuelan people” to see their leader detained after years of economic collapse under socialist rule.
But not all Republicans were unequivocal in their support. 
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, compared the situation to the 1990 U.S. capture of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega but cautioned against open-ended military engagement.
“I am concerned about U.S. military intervention in foreign countries because of its potential to lead to protracted U.S. engagement,” Griffith said, adding that he would seek more information about future U.S. involvement and insist on congressional oversight.
With the General Assembly set to convene and Congress preparing to vote on war powers, Helmer’s legislation and Kaine’s resolution are set to test how much appetite there is to rein in presidential authority, amid Republican praise for what they describe as a decisive show of American strength.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As state lawmakers prepare to reconvene in Richmond for the 2026 legislative session next week, Virginia is also working to reduce its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) error rate or risk losing its federal funding, while also now verifying recipients’ eligibility — which levies more work onto already-strained health and social service systems. They also must contend with forthcoming changes to Medicaid eligibility. 
Social services staffers around Virginia have for years grappled with outdated technology and are now preparing for extra workloads; a new bill could spur upgrades that might help.
Here’s what Virginia is doing so far to reduce its SNAP error rate

House Bill 66 by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would direct the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Department of Social Services to modernize the information technology they use to provide social and medical programs to Virginians. 
While the federal shifts make it timely, the departments’ old tech isn’t a new issue. The Virginia Case Management System (VaCMS) — first built in the 1990s — is outdated, a 2024 state-commissioned study revealed.
It’s also a concern Feggans heard last year from constituents as he served on a bipartisan committee to assess how the state could respond to federal cuts. 
The 2024 study noted delays or timeouts if more than a few hundred social services workers were processing cases simultaneously on VaCMS — a common occurrence, considering eligibility determination work is handled by hundreds of local social services workers around Virginia. 
“Poor user experience with VaCMS leads to the use of workarounds, further increasing variability in the process,” the report stated. 
The note of constraints with VaCMS was among “strong concerns” relayed by the Virginia League of Social Services Executives in feedback last summer to the state government, records obtained by The Mercury show. 
Smaller staff at local offices have also expressed worry about the extra work outlined in the reconciliation bill Congress passed last summer. The federal legislation spurs states to reduce their error rates for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits along with eligibility determination changes for both SNAP and Medicaid. 
While SNAP helps low-income people afford groceries, states that fail to reduce their error rates could be on the hook for millions that the federal government typically provides. Error rates — an overpayment or underpayment to beneficiaries — can stem from paperwork mistakes by social service workers or outdated information from recipients. About 850,000 Virginians rely on the program to feed their families. 
Medicaid is a joint state and federal program that provides health insurance coverage to about 1.9 million Virginians who live with disabilities, are pregnant or low-income earners without employer-provided coverage. Changes to Medicaid eligibility could likely affect about 630,000 of Virginians at risk of losing it and the expanded work load for social services workers, which Virginia’s Medicaid director told state lawmakers last summer will “be hard on them.” 
Slower and outdated technology can  increase margins for human error and make it harder for Virginia to meet the federal mandates. 
Feggans said it’s important for state lawmakers to “make sure that we can take care of as many people as we can in the state with so many cuts coming from the federal government.”
The state government should invest in a new IT system to counteract these challenges, Feggans added. Prior to his service in the legislature, Feggans worked in health care technology for the U.S. Air Force. He “knows what it means” to have systems that are efficient. 
As the bill must advance through the legislature in order to end up on Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s desk, Feggans said he plans to work with his fellow lawmakers to sort out how feasible the upgrades may be and at what cost. Amid continued federal funding and service cuts, Feggans emphasized how careful Virginia must be with its resources while still being able to “take care” of constituents.
“The next few years are going to be about austerity,” he said.

Mike DeWine and the head of the state’s Department of Children and Youth say they’ve engaged with the Trump administration to prove Ohio’s child care system is heavily safeguarded and worthy of federal funding.
DeWine and department Director Kara Wente said they haven’t received final word that they will continue receiving federal funding for the Publicly Funded Child Care program, but the state has eight to 10 weeks before “that would be problematic for the program we have now,” according to Wente.
“Certainly we know that we need the federal funds to maintain our program as is,” Wente said in a Monday news conference with DeWine.
“We know that we are moving on every measure that (the Trump administration) has outlined.”
The state leaders spoke to the media after allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota resulted in federal funding freezes for the state, ordered by Trump administration officials.
The allegations came from a right-wing social media influencer and focused on facilities run by Somali immigrants in the state. While the issue was covered extensively in 2022, the social media influencer’s latest allegations have brought it back to the forefront.
Minnesota child care providers say Trump’s funding freeze will shut down their businesses

Ohio, like Minnesota, has one of the largest Somali populations in the country, but DeWine said the conversation should be steered away from the type of citizens running the centers, and toward protecting the public from fraud.
“We need to look at this as not a Somali problem, we need to look at this as a fraud problem,” DeWine said.
The governor said the “vast majority” of the Somali population in Ohio “have been here for a long time.”
He wouldn’t speculate on whether race or ethnicity was playing into the accusations of fraud at child care facilities.
“Many of them are citizens, many of them run businesses,” DeWine said. “So we need to not fixate on any one population, we need to fixate on the problem.”

The state leaders responded to calls from Republican state Rep. Josh Williams, who took to social media to demand that the Ohio Department of Children and Youth “investigate all Columbus-area daycares suspected of potential fraud.”
“We need round-the-clock, unannounced inspections of all child care facilities receiving public dollars to make sure not a single Ohioan’s tax dollars are being stolen,” Williams wrote in a post on X.
Wente said on Monday that her office has been in contact with Williams, telling him the measures he asked for are already methods the department uses to oversee child care centers.
DeWine also decried efforts by public citizens to enter child care facilities, saying the safeguards that are in place at facilities include keeping those who don’t work there or have children in the care of the facility from coming in.
“The facts are there’s a reason that citizens who are going up to video something and trying to see what’s going on inside the doors aren’t being allowed in,” DeWine said, adding that it shouldn’t be a shock that those people are barred from entry.
“Well hell no, no one should let them in,” he said.
At Monday’s press conference, DeWine and Wente provided a lot of the information provided by the governor’s office last week in a press release responding to the Minnesota headlines, including specific measures the state takes to try to prevent and identify fraud in child care centers.
That includes attendance-based funding, identity verification at individual facilities via PINs and QR codes, and regular inspections.
Child care advocates also defended the state’s child care sector last week, and affirmed the governor’s defense that facilities undergo strict scrutiny.
Wente also provided data on 61 child care facilities who were ordered by the department to return overpayments.
In total, the overpayments amounted to “just over $2 million,” the director told reporters.
In 2025, the department received 124 reports from citizens alleging child care fraud.
DeWine remains confident that the Trump administration will review Ohio’s child care program and continue sending federal funding to the state.
“We have about eight weeks and we have every confidence this will get resolved, and the federal government will be satisfied with what we’re doing,” DeWine said.

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)PORTLAND, Ore. — One year into President Donald Trump’s second term, Democratic attorneys general have filed 71 lawsuits against the administration.
There’s more to come in 2026. The lawsuits are part of a coordinated legal strategy by Democratic AGs in 22 states and the District of Columbia to resist the ever-widening power of the executive branch.
It’s not unusual for states to sue an administration; the party not in the White House has often turned to the courts. But it’s one of the few pathways for Democrats now, since Republicans hold the presidency, both chambers of Congress and have appointed a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And Trump in his second term has taken a much broader view of presidential power than previous administrations, asserting far more authority than his predecessors.
Democrats hope to retake at least one chamber of Congress in November’s midterm elections. But for most of the coming year, the party will be relying on AG court challenges as their main venue to take on Trump.
‘A boundless power’: Democratic states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago

One of the most prolific AGs is Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who has led or joined 52 lawsuits against this Trump administration.
“It’s not a slogan or a political brand,” Rayfield said of the coalition in an email interview with Stateline. “It’s a working partnership. When we coordinate, we’re able to defend the constitutional balance, push back when a president overreaches, and make sure our residents aren’t left paying the price for unlawful decisions coming out of Washington.”
The state AGs have brought cases over Trump’s tariffs and National Guard deployments. They’ve also fought cuts to federal research, education programs, food assistance, disaster recovery, health care and housing. And they say it’s their job to maintain core civil rights protections as well as stick up for the people in their state who, they argue, are harmed by the whims of the president’s executive orders.
“None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez told Source New Mexico.
Since the beginning of 2025, the attorneys general have toured the country on multistate listening tours and have touted their accomplishments on progressive legal podcasts. They’ve won 40 of the 51 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.
The AGs are not alone in taking legal action. Individuals, businesses, labor unions, associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 554 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers, according to Just Security, a daily digital law policy journal with a litigation tracker that monitors challenges to Trump administration executive actions.
But the attorney general coalition serves as “a coordinated, quick-moving and high-capacity force protecting the rule of law, federal funding streams, and people’s rights,” said Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project, which helps state and local governments partner on litigation that protects and advances civil rights.










That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.


– Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project


The attorneys general have proven such a successful coalition that the Public Rights Project is adopting a similar approach that makes it easier for cities and counties to pool expertise, coordinate legal theories and act collectively, Miller said.
“The rule of law is ultimately about people,” Miller said. “When courts enforce the law, families stay housed, public health and emergency services stay open, and local leaders can govern without political coercion. That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.”
Immediate action
Democratic AGs began filing their multistate lawsuits the day after Trump took office, challenging the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The immediate legal action was intended to send a clear message to the Trump administration that state attorneys general will “stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring.
Rayfield said some days their work aims to build an emergency firewall to halt unlawful presidential actions — such as deploying the National Guard. Other days, it’s more targeted, fact-driven litigation designed to keep money, benefits and services flowing to states.
In December, Rayfield, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown led a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the governor of Pennsylvania in challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for threatening to punish doctors, hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care.
Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

In early November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments from Oregon’s then-solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States. Rayfield and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes began discussing a tariff lawsuit in April, before a joint appearance at a town hall in Oregon. Both had been considering it, but it was their in-person discussion that led to the collaboration, Mayes said during a panel discussion hosted by the “Legal AF” podcast on the MeidasTouch Network.
“This is not what I get up every day wanting to do,” Mayes told Cronkite News outside the Supreme Court, after Gutman argued the tariff case. “But if Donald Trump decides to violate the Constitution, violate statute, or harm the people of Arizona, I’m going to file that lawsuit.”
After Trump’s 2024 election, Democratic attorneys general began meeting almost daily over Zoom to prepare their legal approach for a second term. This time around, they had a better sense for what was coming because it was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s agenda so far.
As they enter their second year of legal collaboration, the AGs continue to meet regularly, but because they’ve developed close working relationships, it’s at a “more sustainable cadence,” Rayfield said.
Republicans sue, too
Republican attorneys general say they, too, are taking action to protect state sovereignty. Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post in November that lawsuits emerging from progressive states, particularly state- and municipal-driven cases in state courts over climate change, are “as much of a threat to state sovereignty as the federal government” as well as an attempt to “remake the nation in the image of progressive enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.”
“They reach into states like Alaska with their rules and regulations,” Cox wrote. “They push misguided legal theories targeting ordinary Americans. And they file lawsuits that would give state courts in ideologically aligned jurisdictions the chance to control the economies of states like mine.”
Republican attorneys general have been largely supportive of the president’s second-term agenda, including supporting the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Led by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, Republican attorneys general in 26 states sent a letter in support of such a mobilization in June in Los Angeles, describing it as “the right response — and one we fully support.” And as recently as October, Republican attorneys general in 16 states wrote a letter supporting the Trump administration’s attacks on boats it says are smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
State attorneys general have long taken on the executive branch, no matter who was in power.
Democratic attorneys general filed 138 multistate lawsuits against federal agencies during Trump’s first administration, according to a 2020 assessment by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
And some Republican attorneys general were especially litigious during the Biden administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton famously sued the Biden administration 106 times, including a suit challenging the administration’s offshore drilling policy in the final days of the presidency. Paxton followed in the footsteps of his Republican predecessor, now-Gov. Greg Abbott, who sued the Obama administration 31 times as a Republican attorney general: “I go to the office. I sue the federal government. Then I go home,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2012.
20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Attorneys general in more progressive states say their actions during the current administration have kept their states from losing billions of dollars in federal funds that would have otherwise been blocked for schools, public health, domestic violence prevention and other services. In Oregon, it’s an estimated $4.5 billion, Rayfield said. Arizona estimates it has held on to $1.5 billion. In California, it’s $168 billion.
In Oregon, one of the lawsuit hearings this fall drew an audience so large that an overflow courtroom adjacent to a packed main federal courtroom was needed. A crowd quietly watched arguments on a video display as lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops was not only a vast federal overreach, but also a threat to state sovereignty and public safety.
The administration said it deployed the Guard to protect federal agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department described protesters as “vicious and cruel radicals” for their demonstrations outside of an ICE facility in Portland, the phrase elicited muffled snickers from the otherwise decorous courtroom observers.
Among the protesters dominating news reports and social media feeds was a 20-something in a chicken costume. Other peaceful protesters spawned a new symbol of resistance: inflatable frog costumes. And naked bike riders rolled up en masse to the ICE facility, too, braving a cold, wet day and exposure on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.”
But the issue in front of U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut was no laughing matter.
Oregon’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s National Guard deployment was a critical public safety outcome for the state, Rayfield said. It prevented troops from mobilizing in Portland, forestalling what he described as “the kind of escalation that could have caused real harm.”
Attorneys general are prepared in 2026 to monitor and enforce their courtroom victories, Rayfield said. He and other state officials and local prosecutors have warned U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that excessive force by DHS officers won’t be tolerated during immigration enforcement activities. If warranted, they’ll refer them for prosecution, he said.
“That isn’t just a legal win — it’s a safety win,” Rayfield said. “The president cannot use federalization as a shortcut to move troops into American cities without lawful cause. That matters for Portland, and it matters for every state watching what happened here.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Flu cases, hospitalizations are rising sharply in CT",Jenna Carlesso and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/ct-flu-cases-hospitalizations-rising/,"Flu cases in CT have increased dramatically over the last month, and officials say the surge in illnesses is happening earlier this year.","Flu cases in Connecticut have increased dramatically over the last month, and health officials say the surge in illnesses is happening earlier this season.
For the week ending Nov. 29, 831 cases were reported. A month later, during the week ending Dec. 27, the state recorded 4,755 cases.
The numbers are far higher than what was reported in December of last year. During the final week of 2024, the state logged 611 flu cases.
Hospitalizations are also on the rise. Seventy-three were reported during the week that ended on Nov. 29; a month later, the state reported 432 hospitalizations.
“Looking at the trajectory of our curve for the flu right now, it’s up,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner. “Unfortunately, I predict it’s going to be a tough winter. I don’t know where we’ll top out.”
“It’s definitely far earlier than last year,” she said of the surge in cases. “And would I say it’s maybe a little bit earlier than a typical flu season.”
The increase is not unique to Connecticut. Several other states have seen big jumps in cases this month. New York’s health department said the week ending Dec. 20 marked the most flu cases the state had recorded in a single week since 2004: 71,000.
“What everybody’s alarmed about right now is the rapid rise,” said Dr. Ulysses Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at Hartford HealthCare. “The mountain was much steeper in the sense that we went from basically zero to 60 in a matter of weeks.”
Why are cases and hospitalizations up?
Health officials say the rise in cases and hospitalizations is being driven by a new flu variant known as subclade K.
There are two subtypes of Type A flu, and subclade K is a mutated version of one of them, called H3N2. The H3N2 strain is harsh, especially for older adults.
“Any year where H3N2 predominates tends to be a worse year,” Juthani said.
Subclade K’s mutations aren’t enough of a change to be considered an entirely new kind of flu. But they’re different enough to evade some of the protection from this year’s vaccine, medical providers said.
“The mutations have made it more communicable. It’s basically new to our immune system, so that’s why it’s evading our immune system,” Wu said.
While the new variant appears to spread more quickly, it’s not yet known if it is more severe than others.
“It’s definitely more transmissible,” said Dr. Karl Hellstrand, chair of the emergency department at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury. “The strain is new, so people don’t really have any kind of protection from seeing it in the past.”
The symptoms of subclade K are similar to other variants, he said. They include fever, body aches, sore throat, lethargy and sometimes vomiting and abdominal pain.
Still, Juthani said, the flu vaccine is effective against hospitalization and death. 
“In data that we’re seeing published around the world, the flu shot is 70% protective for hospitalization and death in adults,” she said.
What concerns do health officials have?
Health officials said they worry about increasing vaccine hesitancy and capacity at hospitals this flu season.
“My biggest concern is capacity at the hospitals,” Juthani said. “I worry about hospital capacity, [intensive care unit] capacity, and the overall strain on the health care system.
“Whenever there is less confidence in prevention efforts and less uptake of prevention efforts, health care will see the consequences down the road. That’s what I’m bracing for — what we’re going to continue to see as the weeks unfold.”
With the flu surge arriving earlier this season, physicians said they are concerned that not enough people have been vaccinated.
“It kind of snuck up on us. And there is a significant percentage of people who have not gotten vaccinated,” said Dr. Christopher Davison, chair of emergency medicine at Greenwich Hospital. “If you have not gotten vaccinated, now is the time to do that.”
“The annual, seasonal concern we deal with, almost like clockwork, is busy emergency rooms in combination with hospitals at capacity,” he added. “It’s a challenging combination, but we work through it.”

What can people do to protect themselves?
Getting a flu shot, practicing good hygiene — frequently washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes — and masking in crowded spaces can help prevent illness, health officials said.
“The influenza vaccine, it may not be perfect, but it will help you,” Wu said. “We measure vaccine effectiveness for some of these diseases by keeping people out of the hospital. So, its job is to keep people out of the hospital. Even though people may think there’s a bit of a flu mismatch with the vaccine, it’s still very important to get it.”
While this year’s vaccine isn’t a perfect match to the subclade K strain, a preliminary analysis from the U.K. found it offered at least partial protection, lowering people’s risk of hospitalization.
The CDC and major medical societies recommend a flu vaccine for almost everyone age 6 months and older. Despite recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven’t changed.
Flu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.
Health officials are urging people to stay home if sick.
“If you’re sick, don’t get other people sick,” Wu said. “When people are sick and they’re going into work or going to a party or going to school, and they’re getting other people sick, that may be fine for some of the general population. But when you spread it to somebody who may not do well — let’s say I got you sick … you gave it to somebody else, and then that person gave it to their grandmother, who passed away — people don’t see that downstream effect.”
Most people can treat the symptoms of the flu at home, but issues like breathing problems and chest pain should be evaluated by medical providers, physicians said.
“If you’re having generalized symptoms but you’re able to stay hydrated and control fever and body aches with over-the-counter medications, you can probably continue to do that in conjunction with a primary care doctor,” Hellstrand said. “But once you start having worsening of symptoms, including not being able to drink and stay hydrated, significant respiratory distress or feelings like you can’t breathe, chest pain, vomiting — those are times when you probably need to escalate care by being seen in the hospital.”

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal judge has allowed four New Hampshire residents to join a legal fight with the Trump administration over access to the state’s voter file.
Magistrate Judge Andrea Johnstone of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire ruled Monday that the residents could join the Secretary of State’s Office in opposing efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice to force a handover of state voter information.
Moving forward, the residents — liberal activist Louise Spencer; former Republican state Rep. Neal Kurk; former Democratic state Rep. Bob Perry; and Portsmouth attorney Christopher Cole — will be treated as co-defendants against the federal lawsuit.
“Even assuming that the proposed intervenors’ interest is adequately represented by defendants, their presence in this suit will assist the court in the just and equitable adjudication of this matter,” Johnstone wrote. 
The Trump administration has been requesting states’ voter files this year, with the federal Department of Justice arguing it needs to make sure states are properly vetting voter eligibility. Justice Department attorneys say they are entitled to the information due to the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960. 
But despite multiple requests by the Trump administration, New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan has refused to provide the voter file, pointing to state law that restricts the file to political parties and candidates. 
In September, the Justice Department challenged Scanlan’s refusal in federal court in Concord. 
The lawsuit is still pending. But days after it was first filed, Spencer, Kurk, Perry, and Cole filed a motion seeking to intervene. 
The residents argued their privacy rights as voters were being directly threatened by the federal government’s attempt to obtain the voter file, which includes voters’ addresses and party affiliation and can include confidential information like Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. And they said they needed to be represented as defendants because New Hampshire officials might otherwise attempt to strike a deal with the Trump administration that could violate residents’ privacy interests. 
After initially opposing the residents’ inclusion as co-defendants, Justice Department lawyers reversed course in December, telling the court it had “no position” on the matter. That reversal came days after the U.S. District Court of Michigan approved a similar request for two voters and the Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans to intervene as co-defendants with the state. 
In a statement Tuesday, Spencer said she was “pleased.” 
“It is important for New Hampshire voters to have an opportunity in court to advocate for our privacy rights and the security of our sensitive personal information,” she said. “We should not have to sacrifice our privacy rights when exercising our fundamental right to vote.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)In yet another sign of exploding inequality, a new data analysis finds that while affordability is an urgent issue for average Ohioans, the richest Americans keep getting richer. A lot richer.
The analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies said that the 935 billionaires in the United States saw their combined wealth grow by nearly 21% in 2025, to $8.1 trillion. The group used data from the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list to do the analysis. 
For comparison, the median family of four in Ohio saw its income increase less than 6% in part of 2025 when compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Census Bureau figures used by the U.S. Justice Department in bankruptcy proceedings.
Meanwhile, prices for consumers have charged ahead, leaving them further behind. 
The analysis referred to a poll conducted for Politico in December. Among other woes, it found that half of those surveyed found it difficult to afford food, 27% skipped a medical checkup due to financial worries, and 23% skipped taking prescription medications for the same reason.

While millions struggle, the analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies found that the richest billionaires have been doing particularly well. 
The 15 richest billionaires saw their combined wealth jump from $2.4 trillion at the beginning of 2025 to $3.2 trillion a year later. That’s a 33% increase in wealth.
When President Donald Trump signed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” last summer, it likely accelerated growing inequality, researchers have found. 
The bill made the 2017 tax cuts permanent, adding $4.1 trillion to the federal debt by 2035, while providing $1 trillion in benefits to the richest 1% of Americans over the same period. The bill also cut more than $1 trillion in programs for the poor, including Medicaid and federal food assistance.
Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, said the very rich are already paying taxes at much lower rates than average Americans.
“It’s not just that U.S. billionaires are entering 2026 with record-breaking increases in extreme wealth: it’s that they are also paying far less in taxes compared to the huge amount of wealth they amass,” he said in a written statement. 
“Average taxpayers like you and I pay income tax at triple the rate of the wealthiest Americans. Not only are a small number of Americans holding more wealth than the rest of America, but they’re also not paying their fair share of taxes.”
Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the very richest American billionaires did especially well last year, according to the analysis:

Elon Musk of Tesla, X and SpaceX, had $726 billion, up from $421 billion at the beginning of 2025. That’s a 72% increase.
Larry Page, Google co-founder, had $257 billion, up from $156 billion a year ago. That’s a 65% increase.
Sergey Brin, another Google co-founder, saw a 60% increase to $237 billion.
Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, saw a 17% increase to $245 billion.
Jeff Bezos of Amazon saw a 4% increase, to $242 billion.

All of the top five are heavily involved in artificial intelligence. 
Ohio and many other states are providing huge tax subsidies to build data centers to support AI despite the fact that the centers work with skeleton staff and support few jobs. At the same time, the centers’ huge power demands have caused average consumers’ utility rates to spike.

In landmark rulings in November, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ordered FirstEnergy’s three regulated companies to pay roughly $250 million for violations linked to the state’s largest-ever utility corruption scandal. More than $186 million of that will be refunded or credited to consumers.


It’s one of the biggest such penalties in U.S. history. The rulings in three cases represent ​“an important milestone in fixing the harms FirstEnergy caused,” said Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis — even though the relief comes more than five years after her office first asked regulators for accountability and falls well short of what she and others pushed for.


The utility corruption scandal surrounding FirstEnergy and House Bill 6 isn’t just the largest in Ohio history — it also ranks up there nationwide, where such occurrences have happened more often than regulators or consumers would want.


As part of the scheme, FirstEnergy paid roughly $60 million in bribes to pass the law bailing out unprofitable nuclear and coal plants, and then to thwart Ohioans’ constitutional right to a referendum on it. FirstEnergy also admitted that it paid $4.3 million to Sam Randazzo shortly before he became chair of Ohio’s utilities commission in 2019, with the understanding that he would provide favorable treatment for the company.


A lawsuit and subsequent legislation halted HB 6’s nuclear subsidies before they began. But the law’s coal subsidies lasted five and a half years, up until this August, costing consumers approximately half a billion dollars in all.


On July 21, 2020, just about a year after Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed HB 6 into law, federal agents arrested former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R), former Ohio Republican Party Chair Matt Borges, and others in connection with the bribery scheme. Householder and Borges were found guilty of federal racketeering charges in 2023.


The Nov. 19 rulings by the utilities commission, also known as the PUCO, mark the first time FirstEnergy’s utilities will pay anything to Ohio and its consumers for regulatory violations related to HB 6.


The company previously paid $230 million under an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve a criminal charge, plus another $100 million to settle federal securities claims, and $20 million to avoid state criminal charges. The company also paid nearly $50 million to settle a class action lawsuit.


 Ripples in the rate cases

On the same day as its HB 6 rulings, the PUCO also approved a rate hike for some of FirstEnergy’s customers, albeit one much smaller than what the company initially requested. Regulators granted an annual increase of nearly $76 million for approximately 745,000 customers served by the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.


Meanwhile, rates will fall for customers of Toledo Edison and Ohio Edison by $24.4 million and $17.4 million per year, respectively. All told, regulators approved a net rate increase of about $34 million — far less than the combined $183 million FirstEnergy asked for.


Consumer advocates had pushed for regulators to go further. The Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel — the state advocate for utility consumers — sought rate decreases totaling roughly $132 million for FirstEnergy customers, including a cut in the company’s rate of return to account for the poor management that enabled the HB 6 corruption scheme.


“FirstEnergy’s executive decisions contributed to increased financial risk, and it is unfair for its consumers to bear this burden through higher electric bills,” Willis said, adding that shareholders should shoulder the cost. ​“Reducing the profits built into rates is also a way to ensure accountability.”


Regulators ultimately rejected that approach.
Yet another battle over FirstEnergy’s rates will probably play out this year, and the HB 6 scandal will likely loom over that process, too.


The day after the PUCO rulings came out, FirstEnergy announced that its three Ohio utilities will file their next rate case in early 2026. So, different rates from the ones just approved will likely kick in as early as 2027.


“FirstEnergy’s announcement does not come as a surprise,” Willis said. That’s because legislation passed earlier this year calls for an end to most bill riders and speeds up rate cases. At least one company has already filed a new rate case under the law.


FirstEnergy’s utilities could use their new rate case to revisit some issues from the recently decided one.


All in all, ​“customers of Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison should be wary of the lower bills” they’ll get after last month’s rulings, said Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group.

They’re an improvement for now, he said, but may not last.


 The book is not yet shut on HB 6

The PUCO’s rulings in the HB 6 cases also stopped far short of the relief sought by consumer and industry groups, which would have topped half a billion dollars.


And while regulators held that another corporate-separation audit should begin within the next three years, they refrained from providing a full review of FirstEnergy’s management practices, which advocates have sought since 2020.


Nonetheless, the $250.7 million in penalties and refunds imposed by regulators ​“are significant and welcome,” said Tom Bullock, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio, a nonprofit watchdog group.


For their part, PUCO Chair Jenifer French and Commissioner Lawrence Friedeman each conveyed relief that the three HB 6 cases had wrapped up. ​“As this journey began, the commission has expressed an unequivocal intent to follow the facts wherever they led, and today we reached the destination,” Friedeman said at the Nov. 19 meeting.


But, as one of the commission’s rulings notes, another case has yet to be addressed. Five years ago, in response to calls for investigations following the initial arrests of Householder, Borges, and others, the PUCO — then led by Randazzo — took the ​“baby step” of ordering FirstEnergy to show that it did not use money from Ohio customers for its HB 6 efforts.


FirstEnergy’s utilities bear the burden of proof in the case. It may be difficult for them to prove the negative, because FirstEnergy had mixed funds from different sources in a money pool. It’s also unclear how much of a penalty regulators will impose if the companies can’t demonstrate that they followed a state law banning use of customers’ money for political or charitable purposes.


Written testimony in that case is due next month, and an administrative trial, called an evidentiary hearing, is set to start on Feb. 24.


Overall, Ohio’s rulings on the HB 6 saga so far have been a mix of good news and bad news when it comes to holding utilities accountable, consumer advocates say.


“What we’ve learned from the whole HB 6 affair was that there was an extremely lax attitude towards regulation [at] FirstEnergy and the other majority utilities in Ohio … that enabled the scheme to be played out,” Anderson said.


He is encouraged by the commission’s decisions last month, which reflected less deference to utilities and more serious financial consequences than past rulings.


“What the PUCO did do here that was quite strong was find FirstEnergy broke multiple Ohio laws,” Anderson said. The assessed penalties also include several instances where the commission levied fines of $10,000, $16,000, or $25,000 per day for different violations, which added up to tens of millions of dollars. If regulators in Ohio applied that approach all the time, not only in the wake of scandal, ​“it would provide utilities with a strong disincentive to take things as far as FirstEnergy did,” he added.


Beyond that, criminal charges remain pending in state and federal court against two former FirstEnergy executives. Whether the outcome of those cases will reduce the incidence of future utility scandals remains to be seen.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine lawmakers are again considering whether to create a separate department to handle child welfare matters after years of turmoil within the office. 
On Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) introduced LD 555 to create a new Department of Child and Family Services during a public hearing before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.
The proposal would set the stage to transfer the state’s child welfare system, which currently operates as the Office of Child and Family Services under the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, to its own department. It would have a commissioner appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature.
Timberlake introduced a similar bill two years ago that was passed by the Maine Senate, but ultimately died. He said he is proposing it again because “the underlying problems it seeks to address have not gone away.”
Oversight panel suggests more than two dozen reforms for Maine child welfare system

In an October 2023 radio address, Timberlake said at the time he saw no other way forward than to separate child welfare from DHHS and reform it “into its own department to properly execute its focused mission of protecting Maine’s families.”
He isn’t the only one who has pushed for this change. The late Bill Diamond, a former Democratic senator from Windham, proposed legislation about five years ago to separate the agency from DHHS after similar conversations around the state’s failing to keep children safe from known abuse and neglect.  
Although DHHS had expressed openness to the idea the last time Timberlake proposed it, the department testified against LD 555, saying it is unaware of evidence that this would be in best interest for children. Instead, it argued that separating child welfare from the larger department would offer less cohesive support for children in state custody. 
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, did not testify for or against the proposal, but said her concerns outweigh her support of the measure, adding that a new department is “not a silver-bullet solution.” She also said she hasn’t seen any research indicating that restructuring would benefit children and families and added that these changes could be challenging to implement at a time when the agency is already strained.
Between 2021 and 2024, roughly 30 children died each year, according to state data. That includes children who died as a result of homicide or whose families had involvement with the state child welfare system, including accidental deaths. Prior to those years, 2019 saw the most child deaths dating back to 2007 with 19.
The proposal has bipartisan support with two Democrats and another six Republicans as co-sponsors, including Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), who told the committee Tuesday that this is a human, not partisan issue.
Having served on the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee for many years, Timberlake said few other issues have consumed as much time and attention as the shortcomings of the state’s child welfare system.
The legislative watchdog scrutinized the Office of Child and Family Services during the 131st Legislative session and came up with more than two dozen suggested reforms for the agency in May 2024. 
Since then, the Office of Child and Family Services has reported to work on implementing those policy changes and recommendations from lawmakers. The agency’s director has been providing quarterly updates to the Health and Human Services committee to keep them updated on the progress.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/state-signs-16-Large-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 04:57:55.670460

She died Dec. 31. (Photo by Mark McCormick)Josephine Vonceal Pace “Jo” Brown visited my high school back in the 1980s. The administration at good ol’ North High invited her to speak about her historic career as the first Black woman to chair Wichita School Board. 
We learned that day that the Mrs. Jo spoke hard, even painful truths wrapped in her unique brand of sophistication. No one had the status nor the courage to censor her. Her voice carried. 
She told the auditorium about the Wichita she’d lived through, including a practice of allowing Black students to swim only late on Fridays, after white students. Staff then drained and refilled the pool, to save white students from swimming in the same water. 
That story landed hard. We were the last generation of youth whose parents were shaped in a pre-civil rights America. We understood this historically, but Mrs. Jo made us feel it. 
That will moor much of her legacy: standing 10-toes or high-heels down on truth and giving people the kind of cultural equilibrium to speak loud and true about what hurts.
She died New Year’s Eve at 96, unwilling to let the year end before having her final say. 
Years later, as a columnist, my reference to that pool story in a column ignited a reader firestorm. White, Jim Crow-era graduates claimed that the pools weren’t segregated.  
Letters begat calls for a retraction and for me to be fired. I dug in as the newspaper brass pressed me to relent. 
Enter Mrs. Jo. 
“They’re after you, aren’t they baby?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
She said, “Humph,” with a resolve in her voice. The cavalry had arrived. 
“Here’s what you do,” she said. “You go down to the Central Branch Library. Go into the Special Collections desk and ask for a book written by Sandra Van Meter.”
Mrs. Jo explained that as board chair, she’d commissioned a book documenting the district’s history and that in one of the chapters, we’d all learn the truth, and it proved worse than anything I’d shared. 
The district literally had convened discussions about building a separate school to keep Black students and white students out of the same water. The district never built that separate building but maintained the strange water-purity practice. 
Similar stories existed from Wichita to Salina to progressive Lawrence and into the South. Heather McGhee, in her 2021 book, “The Sum of Us,” shared how Montgomery, Alabama, paved over its municipal pool — that Black taxes help build — rather than integrate it. 
It’s precisely this kind of history many Americans today would banish rather than face. Their revulsion at this black-and-white image of themselves offers a brutal contrast to the lived experience of Black residents only allowed to skate or visit dentists on certain days. 
Mrs. Jo fought against such practices, and she’s partly the reason I prioritize telling various historic and social truths regardless of the often-frightening backlash. 
The point was not for her to forever stand behind me but to show me how to stand on my own. Much of the courage I stood on, whether calling out a school bus company or a police website humiliating women, came from her. 
Imagine what she lived through, not just as an educator following the Brown decision, but in a district that considered foregoing federal funds rather than integrating. Letters from white parents who didn’t want “n-words” teaching their children. 
Despite that, she offered a warm smile and regal kindness. She never seemed bitter, just resolutely unbothered. When I read this stanza in “Still I Rise” — 
 “Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard,
‘Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own back yard.” —
 it reminded me of Mrs. Jo. In a society expecting her to dim her light, Mrs. Jo set the night sky ablaze with searchlights. 
 When she confronted the yet lingering vestiges of that era, at a bank or a store, she would correct them as she might one of her tiny students. Firmly but gracefully. 
 “You don’t pay and beg, baby,” she told me once. 
She could be blunt, but not cruel. Her advice pinched your heart but fixed your vision. She often attributed her ability to speak so boldly to her husband, the late Dr. Val J. Brown Sr., whose medical practice sheltered her from reprisals. 
That voice. It bridged eras and will outlast us all. She used that voice to help so many people and guided still more toward finding their own.

Ohio is at an energy crossroads. It forged America with steel and manufacturing, but our state is now facing the challenge of how to meet soaring electricity demand from AI facilities, data centers, and a growing central Ohio population, while also achieving state-level energy independence. And that’s all without driving up costs for working families.
One answer lies, quite literally, overhead.
Solar power represents one of the most practical, cost-effective, and job-creating opportunities available to Ohio.
It strengthens the grid, lowers long-term energy bills, and supports our manufacturing base.
From Mansfield to Toledo to Columbus, our steelworkers already produce the racking and components that support solar arrays across the country. This industry is where American labor meets Ohio ingenuity.
When electricity is produced near the point of consumption — whether homes, businesses, or factories — it eliminates the need for costly transmission upgrades that end up on ratepayers’ bills and avoids importing energy from other states.
One advantage solar installations offer is offsetting demand during peaks, like hot summer afternoons when utilities rely on expensive “peaker” plants to fill the gap.
By offsetting that demand, solar reduces grid strain and keeps energy costs down for everyone.
The need is urgent.
Ohio’s data center and AI boom has placed enormous pressure on local grids, water systems, and energy bills. A key study showed that these facilities now contribute around 95,000 jobs and $11.8 billion to our state’s economy.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At the same time, the electricity demand from these facilities continues to surge, with electric bills doubling for many Ohioans.
In places like New Albany and Dublin, local leaders are already weighing how to balance economic growth with infrastructure capacity.
Solar is the fastest and most cost-efficient way to meet that demand responsibly.
We’re up to the task. More than 26,000 Ohio families have already invested in solar.
Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that aids solar owners and supporters, has helped hundreds transition to solar through state-wide bulk purchase programs.
This local investment in solar is saving families money and fueling a growing homegrown industry.
Meanwhile, Ohio’s clean-energy workforce now boasts more than 100,000 jobs and 268 companies operating, specifically, in the state’s solar supply chain.
Terrasmart is one of those companies. It’s a leading solar racking manufacturer and installer that collaborates with 14 Ohio-based companies that supply steel, tubes, fasteners, galvanization, shipping, and installation services.
This is an example of how solar is feeding a state-focused supply chain while also employing more than 250 people in the Cincinnati area.
Every new array supports welders, fabricators, and electricians — the craftsmen who have long defined Ohio’s industrial spirit.
Expanding that workforce creates energy, strengthens small towns, and keeps prosperity within our borders.


That’s why state lawmakers are taking action.
In November, the Ohio House overwhelmingly passed a bill to expand community energy programs, which let Ohioans buy or lease shares in a shared solar project and get credits on their electric bills as if the panels were on their own homes.
For renters, apartment dwellers, and homeowners with shaded roofs, this reform offers a real way to take part in the energy economy. It expands ownership and helps local communities take charge of their power. The bill is now in the Ohio Senate.


Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio will soon determine how to share the costs of powering the state’s expanding data-center industry. Yet without additional local generation, those costs risk being passed along to everyday consumers.
This is a matter of economic foresight, not ideology.
Passing a community energy bill, supporting domestic supply chains, and aligning state and federal incentives will both protect ratepayers and secure Ohio’s role as a manufacturing leader in the 21st century.
The sun shines on every community in Ohio. Harnessing its power is practical and rightly typifies the belief that the nation’s energy future should be built here at home.

Wes Moore and Kenneth Naylor with Atlantic Pacific Cos., discuss future development in the Capitol Heights area near its Metro station. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)After his proposed housing legislation stumbled in the 2025 General Assembly, Gov. Wes Moore (D) unveiled a package of bills for the 2026 session that last year’s critics were giving a tentative thumbs-up Tuesday.
While there is likely “compromise waiting to happen” on parts of the package, an official with a lobbying group for Maryland county leaders, a key opponent last year, said county officials hope to come to agreement with the Moore administration on this year’s housing legislation.
“I think 2026 will be a different story,” said Michael Sanderson, executive director for the Maryland Association of Counties. “We’ve had a lot of conversations leading up to this year, and I think that’s been productive.”
Sanderson’s comments follow Moore’s unveiling Tuesday of his 2026 housing legislative package, a slate of housing development bills that he says will help reduce the state’s 94,000 housing unit shortage.
The presentation came at the Capitol Heights Metro station in Prince George’s County, to highlight part of his plan that includes a priority to encourage new development around high transit areas, including mixed-use housing, among other measures.
In 2026, affordable housing is needed ‘now more than ever,’ but getting there is the challenge

“We know that outdated zoning laws and bureaucratic red tape – they will limit housing supply, that they will cause a lack of affordability,” Moore said. “That’s why you will see on Jan. 14, our administration will continue to implement the most aggressive housing policies this state has seen in a generation, and we will do it unapologetically.”
His Maryland Transit & Housing Opportunity Act would eliminate parking minimums for housing developments within a quarter mile of transit, focusing on rail services. The bill would also delay collection of impact fees or excise taxes until after housing construction near transit is complete, among other measures.
Moore’s event coincided with the announcement of a contractor to redevelop the area around the Capitol Heights Metro station, and early renderings of the project.
“Today represents a new way that we are going to have these conversations, because this station represents the heart of the Blue Line corridor,” Moore said, referring to the Metro line in Prince George’s County that runs from the District line to the Downtown Largo station.
“For too long, we have seen how this has been acres of asphalt, a parking lot that just sits empty while the demand for housing skyrockets,” he said.
The state selected Atlantic Pacific Cos. to redevelop the area with approximately 300 new homes and 10,000 square feet of retail. Moore said that the development around the Capitol Heights station should serve as an example for the type of development his transit-oriented housing legislation would support.

Another one of the bills, called the Starter and Silver Homes act, would prohibit local jurisdictions from issuing minimum lot size requirements, allowing  developers to create smaller properties that serve as starter homes and homes for elderly people looking to downsize.
“Right now, local mandates require lot sizes that are so large, the only thing you can build is a huge home,” Moore said. “Not everybody needs a huge home, nor wants one.”
“It offers a measure of flexibility and freedom to stop shutting out Maryland’s working families and stop shutting out Maryland seniors from having the opportunity for home ownership,” he said.
The last piece of Moore’s housing package would reignite a battle around “vesting rights” for developers, meaning they would have a guarantee they can build on a property once a project is approved and that the project would be subject to the laws and policies in place at the time of its application. Vesting rights were part of Moore’s unsuccessful effort to push housing development legislation in the last session.
The 2025 legislation, which initially aimed to tie housing development to areas with high job growth, immediately came under fire from MACo because it limited county government say over some housing decisions.
The bill did not get its first hearing until March, in the back half of Maryland’s 90-day legislative session. It was heavily rewritten, replacing the administration’s proposal with language that granted vesting rights for developers, among other measures. It ultimately died in the Senate Energy, Education and Environment Committee as time ran out on the session.
Sanderson said that last year’s vesting right legislation “fell apart.”
“I feel like there is a compromise waiting to happen,” he said on vesting rights. “We’ve been talking very aggressively over the last several months, all pointing toward ‘let’s get something done.’ So I’m optimistic that we’re going to find a path to ‘yes’ on a lot of issues that have been elusive up to this point.”

With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the first of several candidate responses.
California’s insurance regulation is dysfunctional because politicians with no relevant qualifications keep running for Insurance Commissioner as a stepping stone.
I am a lifelong Democrat with over two decades of insurance and financial experience, first building an auto and home insurance brokerage business, then working as a financial analyst. This is my first run for elected office, and I will not run for any other office if elected. 
My only ambition is to fix what Sacramento has broken.
Solving our insurance crisis starts with reorienting the California Department of Insurance. It is too lax regulating insurance companies’ behavior, yet too strict controlling their market access. Customers lose both ways. My plan flips the script, holding insurance companies accountable while increasing choice and competition. 
The recently formed Smoke Claims & Remediation Task Force is an example of failing to hold insurance companies accountable. Modern wildfires cause unprecedented smoke damage, requiring new coverage standards. But reporting reveals the task force unacceptably favors insurance companies over science. I will create a new, unbiased task force to issue trustworthy standards and then make insurance companies follow them.
Another failure of accountability is claims payments. The state insurance department collects Market Conduct Annual Statements, identifying insurers who unfairly delay or deny claims. However, the insurance industry has lobbied to anonymize this data, shielding individual companies. I will have the insurance department release company-specific data and publish a claims performance report card for each insurance company, empowering customers to reward good actors and punish bad actors.
Customer empowerment requires robust choice and competition, yet the insurance department strangles both with bureaucratic red tape. Insurance companies filing product or rate changes wait 300 days for review versus 60 days in other states, and with much less predictable decisions than any other state because the department micromanages every case.
These endless delays and capricious rulings are disastrous, leading to insurers canceling policies and leaving California. I will streamline filing timelines and reserve strict reviews only for special cases as needed. Insurance companies will flock to our gigantic market once they have clear rules providing the reasonable certainty and flexibility they need to operate economically. 
As more companies come, more choice and competition will follow.
With strong regulation holding insurance companies accountable and empowering customers, ample choice and competition will prevent price gouging. But to hold ourselves accountable that the market is working and pricing is fair, I will publish an annual benchmarking report comparing California to all other western, fire-affected states.
As insurance becomes plentiful in California again, people will no longer need to turn to the FAIR Plan in desperation. Nevertheless, the FAIR Plan remains necessary and must be bolstered. I will require all insurance companies doing business in California to invest in improving FAIR Plan service. In return, we must allow FAIR Plan rates to become fully actuarially sound, as required by statute. This will stabilize FAIR Plan finances and incentivize customers to get better and cheaper coverage in the regular market.
Fixing insurance regulation can hold insurance companies accountable, provide transparency, make insurance widely available, prevent price gouging and stabilize the FAIR Plan. But to bring costs down to where they belong, we must aggressively reduce wildfire risk.
To protect homes, the state must provide clear home hardening guidance that aligns with insurance company underwriting and comes with accompanying discounts. Since home hardening helps everyone but burdens the homeowner, the insurance department must develop financial assistance programs homeowners need and deserve. 
Statewide, the way to sustainably lower the cost of wildfire risk — plus save lives and property — is to take better care of our forests. It is outrageous that our state government has allowed wildfire risk to get so bad. As Insurance Commissioner, I will fight relentlessly for better forest management.
California needs and deserves a functioning insurance system. With the right leadership, we can finally make insurance work the way it should for everyone in California.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A House Republican is charging back into a continuing fight over vaccines and doctors that created a huge rift during last year’s legislative session.
Rep. Jeff Holcomb late last month filed HB 917, a proposal that takes aim at doctors who refuse to treat patients based on their vaccination schedule while also delving into other contentious health care treatment disputes.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis backed a similar bill last year championed by Department of Health Secretary and State Health Officer Dr. Joseph Ladapo, but the vaccine provision was stripped from the bill.
In an email to the Florida Phoenix, Holcomb said he “feels strongly” the bill will pass this year.

“We saw during the Covid pandemic that medical decisions were made without proper safety measures. We have a similar situation with the childhood vaccine schedule. The vaccines our children are mandated to have do not have sufficient safety studies. This was confirmed yesterday with CDC shrinking the recommended childhood vaccine schedule,” he said, referencing the decision Monday to shrink the recommended number of childhood vaccines from 17 to 11.
Holcomb’s bill doesn’t eliminate any vaccine mandate now in Florida statute or rule. 
The bill does amend Florida’s Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities to make clear that a health care provider or facility cannot discriminate against a patient based upon the patient’s vaccination status. 
Additionally, Holcomb’s bill would add “vaccine status” to the list of reasons protected in law why patients cannot be discriminated against. That list now includes race, national origin, handicap, and source of payment.
The bill would allow the DOH or the appropriate licensing board to discipline providers who discriminate against patients based on vaccine status. The penalties in law vary from restricting, suspending, or revoking a license to imposing administrative fines or both.
Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics President Rana Alissa, a Jacksonville physician, said the association does not support HB 917.
“When you have somebody that is unvaccinated and coming with fever, what if that patient has measles? If they are going to come and be in the waiting room with people who have leukemia, or for any reason they do have a lower immune system, they are going to expose them to measles,” Alissa said.

Physician’s offices aren’t designed to safely accommodate unvaccinated patients, she said.
“You have to change the way clinics are built. You have to have a different waiting room, you have to have a different stairs, you have to have a different elevator. You have to have negative-pressure rooms to accommodate these unvaccinated kids when they have signs and symptoms of the illness,” she said. 
“You want to force them to take unvaccinated kids? Then you have to help them reconstruct their clinics and you have to basically accommodate them accordingly.”
The language is identical to what the DeSantis administration pushed for last year in a far-reaching bill that addressed an array of Department of Health-related issues, from background screening requirements for staff at medical marijuana treatment centers to physician licensure requirements.
While HB 1299 ultimately passed and was signed into law by the governor, it didn’t contain the anti-discrimination language the DeSantis administration wanted.
Another vaccine-related provision in HB 917 left over from the 2025 session addresses messenger ribonucelic acid (mRNA) vaccines.
The Legislature in 2023 passed a law that banned governmental entities, business establishments, and educational institutions from discriminating against someone based on mRNA vaccination status. Essentially, the law banned the use of vaccine passports in Florida. But it was valid only through June 2025.
 The DeSantis administration tried unsuccessfully last year to make the ban permanent in HB 1299, but the Legislature refused to go along. Lawmakers did agree, however, to extend the ban through June 2027. HB 917 would make the ban permanent.
No vax, no mask, but still service

DeSantis in September criticized the Legislature for refusing to go along with his health-care proposals. Specifically regarding the mRNA provisions, DeSantis said: “That’s got to be made permanent. I mean, everyone is glad that we did that. Even the far left, I don’t hear them, at least publicly they won’t admit they’re for vaccine passports. It doesn’t make sense. So, they need to do that.”
Vaccines and guns: DeSantis gives a sneak peek at 2026 legislative agenda

The governor and Ladapo said over the summer that they want to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. That would require legislative buy-in that isn’t clear the governor and Ladapo, his state health czar, can expect.
In the meantime, the DOH has proposed changing its rules regarding vaccine requirement for school and day care, specifically removing requirements for children to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccine. The DOH is proposing to also eliminate those vaccines, along with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for admission to a licensed day care facility.
It held a lengthy public meeting on the proposed rule changes in December.
Vaccines maintained, disclosure added 
HB 917 wouldn’t eliminate any vaccine mandate from statute. But the legislation would require every licensed health care provider authorized to vaccinate children to advise parents and legal guardians of the “unique risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.”
Holcomb’s bill would require health care providers to give parents and legal guardians the option of following “alternative vaccination schedules that may consist of not more than one injection or oral administration at each encounter.”
Parent and legal guardians would be required to sign a document attesting they have been provided the requisite immunization information.
 Behind-the-counter ivermectin

HB 917 would authorize pharmacists to sell ivermectin “behind the counter,” which means pharmacy assistance wouldn’t needed to obtain the product.
Ivermectin is an effective treatment for parasites in animals and for use by humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies, according to the National Institutes of Health. The FDA has not approved  Ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, and so far recommends against taking it for COVID-19, instead suggesting people get vaccinated for protection.
Nevertheless, there was buzz during the pandemic about using it for treatment for COVID-19.
HB 917 provides pharmacists who sell ivermectin from behind the counter with immunity from civil and criminal liability as well as disciplinary protections.
Specifically, HB 917 would authorize pharmacists to provide ivermectin to patients and customers as long as the pharmacist provides written information about the indications and contraindications of the use of ivermectin and the appropriate dosage for using ivermectin. The information must advise the person to seek follow up care from a primary care physician.
There is no age restriction in HB 917 for the purchase of ivermectin. Holcomb has also filed HB 29, to legalize over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. That means it wouldn’t be limited but freely accessible.
HB 29 has been referred to three House committees. There is no Senate companion.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FL-hospital.jpg,,,2026-01-07 00:12:15.716874
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 05:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT needs more, not less, action on climate change",Christine Feely,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/ct-needs-more-not-less-ambitious-action-on-climate-change/,"CT should move rapidly to adopt clean technologies such as solar in many forms, solar plus battery storage,  geothermal networks and wind.","We need bold climate action and a clean energy transition.  
Yet, in his Nov. 24 opinion, “Time for Connecticut to rethink its climate strategies,” Noah Kaufman includes this quote: “The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas but in escaping from old ones. ” The opinion’s subtitle, “A lot has changed in climate policy over the last few years — meriting a new path,” tips off the reader to the “old is new, up is down” nature of his essay.
Kaufman’s “new idea” is for Connecticut to be less ambitious in its climate strategies and goals that are described in the Governor’s 2021 Executive Order but are now, apparently, an “old idea.”  It’s hard to believe that plans laid out less than five years ago are old.  But the approach becomes clearer in Kaufman’s statements:  “Under Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts,” and Connecticut should “recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities.”  
In other words, retreat from the path forward because it has encountered bumps in the road.  Instead, Kaufman recommends that Connecticut stick with the actual old and familiar habit of using fossil fuels no matter how sick they make us (cancer, asthma, worsening of other respiratory diseases) and what the cost (destruction of forests and wildlife, pipeline leaks, increased cost of natural gas).
Should Connecticut, along with Rhode Island, have accepted the stop-work order from the Trump administration for the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt wind farm, even though the project was fully permitted and 80 percent complete?  Would the loss of wind energy and all the construction and operating jobs have been a wise decision?  Does Kaufman disagree with the state’s evaluation that “Strategic investment in our port assets, a history of advanced manufacturing, innovative technology and research and development capabilities, have uniquely positioned Connecticut to serve as a first-mover in this new industry, already serving as a launchpad for three offshore wind projects supporting three states?”
No, to Connecticut’s credit (for example), it didn’t fall for Trump’s “I hate wind,” approach and instead pursued and won a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project.  Work resumed on September 22, and the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not appeal the restart.  Connecticut refusing to bow to today’s supposed economic and political realities. On December 22, the Trump administration again halted construction of the project, along with pauses against four other offshore wind farms on the East Coast, for the reported purpose of evaluating national security concerns.
Once again, Connecticut is fighting back. The governors of Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island “are demanding either a briefing on purported security threats or an immediate lifting of stop work orders on five offshore wind projects under construction, including the Revolution Wind project.” In addition, Attorney General William Tong released a statement objecting to the stop work order and declaring that, “We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.” These actions show what the “new idea” really is – for Connecticut to be bold and courageous in pursuing a clean energy future.
The state should move rapidly to adopt other clean technologies that are being aggressively pursued by other states, such as solar in many forms, solar plus battery storage and geothermal networks.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that solar is expected to contribute more than half of new electric generating capacity planned for 2025, with battery storage accounting for almost 20% of the remaining capacity additions.  These increases reported year over year will build the solar and battery capacity quickly.
Connecticut should also move promptly to build its geothermal network capacity.  Connecticut has been cautious and slow to move forward with geothermal networks, which are considered one of the most efficient ways to heat and cool buildings.  Our neighboring states are ahead of us, and we can learn from their experiences.  In fact, even in “today’s economic and political realities,” Massachusetts and New York are moving forward on several geothermal projects.  The nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network in Framingham, MA, whose first section was completed in 2024, recently announced that an $8.6 million grant from the US Department of Energy will provide funding for the network to double in size.  A Boston-based nonprofit is the lead recipient of the funding, and Eversource and the city of Framingham are co-recipients.
Connecticut should also move rapidly from “studying” solar canopies (required by 2025 legislation) to building them.  Tremendous capacity is available on parking lots and other usable spaces near transmission connections.  Solar canopies can provide other benefits such as battery storage, reducing heat islands, protecting cars, and directing the flow of rainwater.
So yes, we should be clear about what are “new” ideas and what are “old” ideas, and we should work hard to develop the true new ideas for clean and renewable energy instead of backsliding on our climate goals and commitments.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,American Democracy needs religion — not less,Andrew Fowler,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/american-democracy-needs-religion-not-less/,"The United States may not have been founded strictly as a Christian nation, but Christian values are intrinsically linked to American democracy.","In a recent editorial, John Hall suggests  that religion is an obstacle to American democracy — a relic of “magical thinking” that breeds conflict, division, and impedes progress, driven by modern “angry, defensive Christians.” His perspective echoes the utopian vision evoked in John Lennon’s “Imagine:” if only there was “no religion too,” humanity could finally live in peace.
However, this dismissive argument misunderstands both American history and the culture’s present realities. Far from threatening democracy, as the headline “Can religion harm democracy?,” implies, religion has been the impetus for constructing the nation’s moral, legal, and civic fabric — and must be a cornerstone of civil society.
Indeed, the core American principles — that “all men are created equal” and limited government — were not borne from Thomas Jefferson’s pen in 1776, but rooted in a classical and Judeo-Christian tradition: that every person, from the powerful to the lowly, has an inherent dignity (or inalienable rights) because they were made in God’s image and likeness.
Although the United States may not have been founded strictly as a Christian nation, nevertheless, Christian values are intrinsically linked to American democracy. In the colonial period, many settlers emigrated  to the New World to escape faith-based persecution and, thus, enshrined the freedom of religious expression  into their charters, which would later appear in the First Amendment. Religiosity also compelled settlers to craft governmental frameworks and list rights in written documents like the Fundamental Orders of 1639 — one of the earliest, and perhaps first written constitutions of a democratic government, which had been adopted  in Connecticut.
As Matthew Spalding notes in The Making of the American Mind, it was “Christianity that largely transmitted the classical tradition, which meant natural-law reasoning, to the modern world.” Indeed, that there are “divine laws that exist prior to, outside of, and above the laws of the state” means the state’s laws are “limited and controlled by a higher or transpolitical authority.”
To an extent, Hall is accurate when expressing the Founding Fathers’ skepticism of religious fanaticism and deistic leanings. Yet they were not irreligious — or even opposed to religious practice. In fact, John Adams clearly  emphasized  the U.S. Constitution was “made only for a moral and religious people,” emphasizing, “It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”
Moreover, the Founders’ predominant concern was not with religious fanaticism, but countering direct democracy, which they  equated  to mob rule and tyranny. As a result, the American republic did not merely implement checks and balances on various government branches, but  humanity’s fallen nature  — and proclivity to abuse power to bludgeon the opposition.
Decades after the Constitutional Convention, Alexis de Tocqueville — who also favored a separation of church and state — concurred with the Founders. Writing in Democracy in America, he saw religion “no less the companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy, and the divine source of its claims,” adding, “The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom.”
The virtues of peaceful coexistence, social justice, and the Golden Rule also stem from religious fervor and tradition. Historically, these values have fueled  charitable giving; equality under the law; the abolition of slavery; the construction of hospitals, universities, and schools; scientific discovery; to even the establishment of free market economic practices, which raised more out of poverty  than its antecedents.
More than simply binding a people together, as Ian Speir argues  in Mere Orthodoxy, religion has been the means of cultivating virtue by governing one’s passions, and fostering a robust civil society. On the latter, a plethora of organizations were inspired by faith like the Salvation Army, Knights of Columbus, the American Red Cross, Samaritan’s Purse, and even the YMCA. As a nation, the U.S. government has a long-storied history  of granting public funding toward humanitarian aid and nonprofits. This impulse, no doubt, was spurred on by a Christian sense of duty to thy neighbor.
In short, the West has been, and continues to be, “utterly saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions,” as Tom Holland notes in Dominion:  How the Christian Revolution Remade the World. And when an injustice does occur, like racism, greed, murder, sexual assaults, or other crimes, we predominantly view it through this moralistic lens.
Yet, in recent decades, religion’s withdrawal  from the public square has not yielded good fruit sociologically. Coupled with the rise of secularization, New Atheism, and modern therapeutic deism, Americans are — coincidentally (or perhaps, consequently) — gripped by a persistent “happiness crisis ,” particularly among younger demographics. However, scientific evidence suggests that religious people are generally happier  and live longer. Indeed, prayer produces psychological benefits: reducing stress, loneliness, and fear, as well as increased connection to community 
But in the past few years, more Americans are religiously unaffiliated  (“nones”) than in previous decades. This poses a significant risk to the health of American democracy since “nones” are “less civically engaged and socially connected than people who identify with a religion,” according to a Pew Research Center survey  released in January 2025.As churches and civic associations close, there will be fewer opportunities to volunteer and collaborate — and, therefore, fewer interactions devoid of politics. The timing could not be worse. Polarization has intensified: most Americans disagree on “ basic facts;” nearly two-thirds  believe the country’s political culture is incapable of solving problems; and about a third  believe violence “may be necessary to set the country on track.”

These realities should give us pause. The erosion of religiosity in American democracy presents an existential crisis. Nonetheless, Hall ascribes the tense political landscape to Protestant fundamentalists’ “disdain” for secular liberals, progressive gender ideology, women’s rights, and the sciences, like vaccines and evolution. Moreover, he criticizes the right’s moral lapse in supporting Donald Trump, who he calls a “political demagogue.” Yet he is unfair to those on the religious right who have felt persecuted over the years, embodied by cases like Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Little Sisters of the Poor, the FBI spying on traditional Catholics, and even Coach Joe Kennedy’s public prayer.
And in a twist of spiritual irony, during the pandemic, the government deemed liquor stores to be essential , but not houses of worship. Point being, the religious right’s frustration is not without cause — and Trump has appealed to their plight more so than Democrats. This has not gone unnoticed by prominent Democrats, like U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock from Georgia, who believe the party has “ceded  ” religion to Republicans.
Ironic, still, is that Hall views these policy disagreements as a threat to democracy — yet disagreement is inherent in America’s republican government. It is a “messy, difficult, and essential struggle,” which he astutely recognizes. After all, no two people think exactly alike. Everyone possesses a unique, individual mind. However, prior to the United States of America, most governments failed to elevate individuality, favoring the authoritarian ‘might makes right’ rule.
Ultimately, any utopia, like the one imagined in John Lennon’s famous song, is impossible. Nevertheless, Lennon’s idealism persists in reducing belief into a coping mechanism for death, while promoting a new age deism. Yet faith-based hope, more so than secularization, has been a powerful force when earnestly lived, accomplishing incalculable good for untold millions be it the poor, marginalized, sick, dying, the uneducated, and the unborn.
The inherent dignity of others, enshrined in our founding documents and born from a religious tradition, has made possible the potential to pursue happiness more so than most persons throughout human history. That is worth protecting and safeguarding.
In truth, a nation unmoored from these values would be catastrophic to sustaining American democracy as we know it. The proof is in the empirical evidence.
So, no — religion is not harmful to democracy; in fact, it’s imperative.
