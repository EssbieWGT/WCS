(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s institutions of higher education are in trouble.
The University of West Florida is being run by Manny Diaz Jr., a former social studies teacher (and ex-Commissioner of Education) but, given that he’s Ron DeSantis’ choice, he’ll likely get the permanent position.
Florida Atlantic and Florida International have had undistinguished former legislators imposed on them; and USF president Rhea Law has announced her resignation, creating an opening for another DeSantis-friendly politician.
At the University of Florida, our supposed flagship institution, the provost is interim, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Law, and Arts are being run by interim deans, and 30 chair or director positions are vacant.
This obvious dysfunction has not gone unnoticed: The best and brightest academics are not exactly enthusiastic about working in Florida.
I’ve been teaching for more than 30 years; I love my job at Florida State — for now, at least. The students are wonderful (most of them), and I admire, even like, my colleagues (most of them).
Ron DeSantis hasn’t gotten around to trying to trash our reputation and cripple our academic freedom the way they have at New College, UWF, and UF.
Not yet, anyway.
The state’s “post-tenure review,” in which professors (who already undergo yearly reviews) must further justify their existence to the Board of Trustees, has driven some of the most productive academics out of Florida.
Nearly a third of Florida’s faculty want to leave the state.
If I were a young professor looking for a job, I’d avoid Florida.
Churn at UF
Our state government is authoritarian and proudly ignorant, hell-bent on destroying what makes universities great — freedom of expression, critical thinking, creativity, exposing students to ideas that may challenge them (or even upset them), unfettered research, scientific rigor, and advances in knowledge based on data.
Why would a scholar want to pursue a career in such a fact-resistant, small-minded, censorious state?
As has become its habit, the University of Florida has changed presidents. Again.
University of Florida Interim President Donald Landry. (Photo via UF X account)
Dr. Donald Landry has become UF’s interim president, replacing Kent Fuchs, the former interim president and one-time actual president who stepped back in when Ben Sasse, the unqualified spendthrift former president resigned under a cloud, and then had to stay on when the trustees’ choice, Dr. Santa Ono, who’d resigned as president of the University of Michigan to take the job at Florida, fell foul of the Board of  Governors’ anti-DEI hysteria.
This is not how serious institutions of higher education conduct themselves.
But then, Florida is not a serious place.
Enter Landry, late of the Columbia Center for Human Longevity and a medical doctor with “elite” Ivy degrees.
Landry seems positively giddy at becoming UF’s latest interim, calling it “the culmination of my career” and “the opportunity of a lifetime,” and demonstrates an Olympic-standard talent for sucking up, calling UF “a preeminent university in what one could argue is the preeminent state in this nation at this moment in time.”
He obviously wants the permanent job. The trustees obviously want him to have it: They’re paying him $2 million for this year, with the possibility of a $500,000 bonus.
If they don’t give him the permanent job, they have to pay him another $2 million.
Purge of academics
While the fact-based community knows Florida is Ground Zero for the climate crisis, Landry told UF’s right-wing trustees what they wanted to hear, insisting the science is “not settled,” even though the science is indeed settled: 97% of climate scientists agree on anthropogenic causes of global warming.
Maybe they should have asked him if the Theory of Gravity is sound or if the sun orbits the earth.
Or if he’ll defend professors’ freedom of speech.
DeSantis and his anti-education squad have passed laws banning anything that smells of DEI, clamped down on the honest study of American history, pitched hissy fits over pro-Palestinian campus protests, and railed against so-called “woke” professors who have the temerity to recognize that gay people exist, trans people exist, systemic racism is real, and science doesn’t care what you believe.
Now they’re going after educators who dare disparage Charlie Kirk.
Let’s stipulate that Kirk did not deserve his violent death. No one does.
He was a human being. He had as much right as the rest of us to speak his mind.
Which is the whole point.
A University of Miami neurologist was fired for posting, “What was done to Charlie Kirk has been done to countless Palestinian babies, children, girls, boys, women and men not just over the past two years of the ongoing genocide, but decades.”
A retired University of Florida law professor was stripped of his emeritus title for saying, “I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump.”
At FAU, three professors have been placed on administrative leave. One, a tenured professor of art history, didn’t comment on Kirk’s death, but re-posted others calling Kirk bigoted and racist.
It’s not illegal.
As the great Rick Wilson says, “tastelessness is not treason.”
‘Outrageous things’
Kirk identified as a “free speech absolutist,” declaring, “You should be allowed to say outrageous things,” even if you upset people.
Among the outrageous things Charlie Kirk said:
On journalist Joy Reid, the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson being “affirmative action picks,” he said, “You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”
On women: They should “submit to a godly man,” marry early, and have babies.
On Jews: “The philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors in the country.”
On guns: “I think it’s worth [it] to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
As offensive, stupid, prejudiced, or karma-inviting as you or I might find what Kirk said, we live under a system of laws that protect his right to say it.
‘Civility’
The question is whether the DeSantis administration and Florida’s education establishment, including UF’s new president, understand that freedom of speech applies to all of us.
Donald Landry says he’s big on civility: “I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility.”
Christopher Rufo via Facebook
Landry enjoys the support of Christopher Rufo, who calls him “a principled leader who will reverse ideological capture and restore truth-seeking within the institution” at UF.
In case you’ve forgotten Rufo, he’s yet another pious conservative who likes to claim he cherishes free expression on campus, telling PBS News Hour in May the DeSantis administration has “expanded the range of discourse in higher education,” and boasting, “At New College of Florida, for example, where I’m a trustee, we have probably the widest range of discourse of any public university in the United States.”
A habit in Florida
Getting rid of a visiting professor who focuses on Black history contradicts Rufo’s smug assertion.
No one at New College accused Erik Wallenberg of incompetence or bad teaching or any other malfeasance.
But Rufo called him “a pure left-wing mad-lib” and sniffed, “New College will no longer be a jobs program for middling, left-wing intellectuals.”
Firing a professor because you don’t like his politics is not evidence of a wide range of discourse.
It’s also likely illegal.
Landry should take note and someone should alert him to Florida’s long, shameful history of McCarthyite attacks on academics.
In the late 1950s, the Legislature started investigating universities, determined to search out communists, biology professors who taught evolution, English professors who assigned “The Grapes of Wrath” and the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, and especially gay people in the student body or the faculty.
Scores were fired or expelled.
Perhaps former president/former interim president Kent Fuchs can tell Donald Landry about the time he, and UF trustees head Mori Hosseini, tried to ban four law professors from signing onto an amicus brief opposing a state law making it hard for former felons to vote, and stop three other professors  from testifying as expert witnesses on the ground that their actions might impede Ron DeSantis’ agenda.
Landry’s UF contract stipulates that a number of important decisions, including hiring, must be approved by Mori Hosseini — which means a highly partisan political appointee will exercise even more control over how the university works, what’s allowed, what’s censored.

Ned Lamont’s veto of House Bill 5002: An Act Concerning Housing and the Needs of Homeless Persons and Senate Bill 8: Protections for Workers and Enhancements to Workers’ Rights.
What are these bills about and what will they do?
H.B. 5002 could be better named the “Democrats Hate Small Town Life in Connecticut Bill.” Among other things, it’s an attempt to mandate far left DEI housing policies into every city and town across the state. Many Democrats appear to believe that all local zoning ordinances are racist and discriminatory. Their solution for increasing the amount of low-income housing in Connecticut is to force the cities and towns to comply with state-issued mandates.
Democratically elected planning and zoning commissions determine local zoning ordinances. They reflect the needs of their municipalities and residents in accordance with current laws. H.B.5002 would sideline local commissions and put the power to decide where, what type and how much low-income housing will be built in the hands of state lawmakers. Compliance with the first version of this bill would have been devastatingly costly to small communities. Even the later, slightly watered down version would be financially problematic for many small towns.
H.B.5002 is nothing but a power grab for Democrat lawmakers in Hartford. It’s a crack in the door Democrats will use to push DEI policies into small communities with limited resources. Unaffordable housing is an inflationary problem of government’s own making. Homelessness is a combination of economic and social problems. But more regulations are not the answer.
Household income in Connecticut did not keep up with the housing market because we lack better job opportunities for our people. Why don’t Democrat lawmakers work to bring back the good paying manufacturing jobs they drove away with high taxes, high-energy costs and excess regulation? Then more people could afford to buy homes again. Governor Lamont was right to veto this bill.
Senate Bill 8 should have been called the “Taxpayers Funding Endless Strikes Bill.” S.B.8 aims to give unionized workers taxpayer funded unemployment benefits while out on strike. This is the second time Governor Lamont vetoed this bill.
If any company needs another reason to not do business in Connecticut, here’s one more manufactured by none other than our own legislature, with the help of public employee unions. How will employers react to the State of Connecticut injecting themselves into private labor negotiations? Would public funding of protracted strikes stifle job growth? You bet it would.
Try to imagine the effect it will have on state, county and municipal union contract negotiations. Public employees can go on strike against their employers, we the taxpayers, and we taxpayers must pay them unemployment benefits until they get what they want from us? Sounds more like legalized extortion than fair labor negotiations.
And all of this to be financed by an overtaxed population of Connecticut workers who (according to a 2022 Nutmeg Research Study) earn on average 40% less in pay and benefits than a State of Connecticut employee who does similar work. Governor Lamont was right to veto both of these bills. In this instance he stood up for the taxpayers, which is something Democrats in our legislature almost never do. Thank you, Governor Lamont.

Kevin Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/29/the-case-for-civics-and-media-literacy/,"After decades of marginalized social studies instruction, many students who enter our classrooms have little understanding of how their government works, or what their role in the process might be.","Nearly 250 years ago, Benjamin Franklin famously opined that delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had provided our fledgling nation with “a republic, if you can keep it.” These words from one of our most revered founding fathers ring a bit prophetic in the current political climate. 
Franklin understood that the great experiment of republican democracy requires action, and that people must work diligently to maintain such a precious form of self-government. Unlike the authoritarian governments of his time, where citizens were subjected to the demands of a ruler, democratic practices must be taught. Consequently, the civic education and engagement of an informed population are imperative in order for a democratic system of government to sustain and thrive.

State Rep. Kevin Brown
In 2023, Connecticut took a major step towards ensuring that our future generations are well-versed in the function of government and the importance of participation within their communities. Created in statute, the Civics Education, Civics Engagement & Media Literacy Task Force was formed to study the level of civic knowledge and engagement in our state, as well as our ability to navigate the ever-changing media platforms that exist in the modern 24-hour news cycle.  The bipartisan and diverse task force membership spent nearly a year checking the civic pulse of our state, only to find that while a variety of programs are working to increase participation in civic life, we fall short of truly preparing our youth to take the lead in their communities as they come of age.
As task force co-chair, a legislator, and most importantly a high school civics teacher, the dearth of civics education in our state causes me tremendous concern.  After decades of marginalized social studies instruction, due largely to a reliance on standardized testing to measure school performance, many students who enter our classrooms have little understanding of how their government works, or what their role in the process might be. 
In 2022, only 24 percent of U.S. students reached the “proficient” standard on the NAEP Civics Assessment. Volunteerism, which has seen a slight improvement since a major drop during covid, has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voter turnout in the last Connecticut municipal election cycle sat just above 30% statewide, and even lower in some of the communities with the greatest needs. 
With so many major issues facing our state and nation, it is easy to look past what many of us take for granted. Recent events, however, including assassinations of political figures on both sides of the aisle, should serve as a warning that a lack of civic knowledge and the ability to discern credible information can lead to an unhealthy distrust of the institution of government, vitriolic rhetoric, and a breakdown of democratic practices as we know them.


All hope is not lost, however. One simple way to encourage our youth to engage in their communities is to reward them for it.  In the 2025 legislative session, there was an opportunity to do just that with the passage of HB 7009, which included the establishment of a state seal of civics education, allowing graduates to earn a seal on their diploma certifying that they have shown proficiency in civic skills and engagement over the course of their high school career. 
While this bill passed overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives, it was not taken up in the Senate. As a state, we must make a commitment to our future and the future of democracy.  While there are many important legislative priorities each year, our ability to address these issues through the democratic process rests upon our ability to educate and engage the public in the practice. 
If children grow up learning how democratic government works, along with the impact their participation can have, they are more likely to engage in their communities as adults. If they can identify credible sources, they will develop opinions that are supported by hard evidence and be able to take meaningful informed action. 
We must put a high level of emphasis on civics and media literacy in the classroom throughout the K-12 experience. Partnering with organizations like the Connecticut Democracy Center, Connecticut Bar Association, and CT Humanities, among others, school districts can develop engaging curricula and provide opportunities for students and adults alike to see the value of civic participation. 
As the Constitution State, let us take the lead on this Constitution Day by paying democracy forward, prioritizing civic education, engagement, and media literacy, and guaranteeing that these subjects are prioritized in schools and communities across Connecticut.

Dover, Del. – Delaware has completed its first comprehensive property tax reassessment in over 40 years across all three counties: New Castle since 1983, Kent since 1987, and Sussex since 1974. This process was mandated following a 2018 lawsuit by civil rights groups, including the NAACP, which argued that outdated valuations led to inequities in school funding reliant on property taxes.
The reassessments, conducted by Tyler Technologies, revealed that residential property values surged, often by 400-500% or more, while commercial values rose more modestly or declined. The reassessment process aimed to be revenue-neutral, with tax rates adjusted down to result in no change in revenue for either the county or school districts. However, the shift in valuations between residential and commercial/non-residential properties significantly altered the tax burden. This disproportionately affected homeowners, with many facing tax increases of hundreds to thousands of dollars annually, particularly in New Castle County where the residential share of the tax burden jumped from 67% to about 76%. School districts in some areas also captured a 10% “windfall” in revenue allowed under state law, exacerbating the outcry.
Public frustration peaked in the summer of 2025, prompting an August 12 special legislative session where seven bills were passed for short-term relief. These included HB 242, which allows New Castle County school districts to reset and split tax rates for residential vs. non-residential properties for the 2025-2026 school year, reducing homeowner bills by shifting some burden back to commercial properties. HB 240 and HB 241 establish payment plans for residential taxes without penalties, interest, or liens if complied with, extending protections through 2026 for longer plans. SCR 122 mandates a statewide review of the reassessment process to ensure future ones (next in Kent 2029, New Castle/Sussex 2030) are fairer and more transparent. Other measures include quarterly reporting on payment plan data and protections against aggressive collection.
These were stopgap fixes; long-term reforms, including broader tax framework changes and exemptions, were deferred to 2026. In response, Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D-Newark), announced committee assignments on September 3, 2025, saying “The special committees… [are] tasked with investigating Delaware’s first statewide property reassessment in more than two generations… to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.” Democratic leaders have emphasized the committees as a transparent, bipartisan effort to review the reassessment process, gather public input, and develop long-term reforms, building on the August special session’s short-term relief measures.
Republicans have criticized the effort as lacking true bipartisanship, claiming their input, such as on bills like HB 73 to double senior credits, was sidelined. Per House Republican Minority Leader, Tim Dukes, and Minority Whip, Jeff Speigelmanj, “Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers… And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion… Republicans [were] not given input or advance notice about the new committees.”
The special committees are structured as separate but coordinated House and Senate committees, each with bipartisan membership. They focus on valuation methods, tax impacts, education funding ties, exemptions, and equity. The committees aim to probe Tyler Technologies’ methodologies, assess homeowner hardships, compare Delaware’s protections to other states, and develop a “roadmap” for equitable future reassessments and targeted relief, such as for seniors and fixed-income households.
The format includes four public hearings in the Senate Chamber at Legislative Hall (411 Legislative Avenue, Dover). All are open to the public, with in-person attendance and livestreaming available at legis.delaware.gov. No registration is required, but agendas and witness lists will be posted closer to the dates.
The updated meeting schedule as of mid-September 2025 is as follows:

Hearing #1: Tuesday, September 30, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. – The Recent Reassessment: Overview of the process, methodologies used by Tyler Technologies, lessons learned, and initial inequities identified.
Hearing #2: Week of October 6, 2025 (Exact date TBD; likely Monday/Tuesday) – Property Reassessment and the Law: Legal background, compliance issues, and guardrails for future cycles.
Hearing #3: Week of October 20, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Delawareans and Their Property Taxes: Impacts on residents, comparisons to other states’ programs, and updates to exemptions post-reassessment.
Hearing #4: Week of November 3, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Property Reassessment and Education Funding: How reassessments affect school revenues, the 10% windfall rule, and balancing equity in funding without overburdening taxpayers.

The committee hearings will be open to public attendance at Legislative Hall and streamed on the General Assembly website, www.legis.delaware.gov. Post-hearing, the committees will compile findings and propose legislation for the January 2026 session.

Private schools in McDonough, Covington and Conyers received as much money as schools in in more populous places like Columbus, Savannah and Atlanta.

 
Of the total $7.1 million program funds distributed so far, most have gone to educational organizations predominantly affiliated with Christian churches, according to data from the Georgia Education Savings Authority, the state agency set up to manage the program.
The private school with the largest amount of funds from the voucher program was Newton County’s Covington Academy with $120,701. It is the only school to have received more than $100,000. Tuition there runs $5,500, plus fees.
The remaining program funding spent this fall — $1.7 million — went to 153 companies, including giant retailer Amazon, that sell school supplies such as computers, tablets and books, records show.

Under the program’s guidelines, families receive $6,500 per year for each child to pay for the switch to a private school or homeschool or other educational supports.
It will take at least 15 months before Georgians will have metrics from GESA’s first review to evaluate whether the promise of the sweeping policy — better quality education and more competition for public schooling — is fulfilled.

Rick Cleveland
Back to 2014.
Remember?
For a while there, both Mississippi State and Ole Miss both ranked among the nation’s top three football teams. State, coached by Dan Mullen, was No. 1. Ole Miss, coached by Hugh Freeze, was No. 3. At one point, both teams were a perfect 7-0. The college football world was astonished. Actually, so were most of us Mississippians. No, it didn’t last, but wasn’t it fun while it did?
Fast forward to Saturday: Ole Miss surely did its part, earning a solid, not-as-close-as-it-sounds 24-19 victory over previously No. 4 LSU to move to 5-0. After a slow start, the Rebels dominated LSU, nearly doubling the Tigers in total offense. In one of the most amazing stats you’ll see this year, the Rebels were penalized for nearly twice as much yardage (109) as LSU was able to gain (59) running the ball.
The Rebels, previously ranked No. 13, soared to No. 4. Trinidad Chambliss should enter the far-too-soon discussions of who might win the Heisman Trophy. And it is not in any way too soon for Chambliss to enter any discussion of the most interesting story in this, or any, college football season. From Division II Ferriss State and the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to Ole Miss and the SEC. From the D-II national championship to the FBS national championship contention. More on that later.
Meanwhile, in Starkville, Mississippi State did everything but knock off 15th ranked Tennessee. If State isn’t the most improved college football team in the nation, the Bulldogs are in the first sentence of any paragraph written on that subject. Southern Miss might be in the next sentence, and we’ll get to the Golden Eagles, too.
State led for much of the game and battled the Volunteers on even or better terms throughout. Watching the Bulldogs these days, it is hard to fathom that just a season ago they lost 10 games, nine by double digits, and defeated only one FBS team. But then, that’s the way it goes in today’s college football world in which if you have the money — and spend it wisely — you can turn over your roster and turn around your football fortunes in one offseason. State and head coach Jeff Lebby clearly spent wisely. 
Same goes for Southern Miss, which spent most wisely, it seems, on Charles Huff, the head coach who last year led Marshall to the Sun Belt Championship and brought with him to Hattiesburg 21 of the players who helped him win it. Clearly, the most critical of those Marshall transfers is quarterback Braylon Braxton, who has thrown for 11 touchdowns and run for another. In Saturday night’s 42-25 pasting of Jacksonville State (which clobbered USM 44-7 a year ago), three for two scores and ran for another and did not turn the ball over.
But let’s get back to Ole Miss, which appears to have all the necessary ingredients to make a run — not only to the FBS playoffs but in the playoffs, as well. Those ingredients include:

A special player at quarterback. Chambliss reminds me most of Kyler Murray, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2018, throwing for 42 touchdowns and running for 11 in leading the Oklahoma Sooners to an 11-2 record. What’s more, the Rebels have Austin Simmons, who opened the season as the starter, in reserve.
A balanced offense that also features running back Kewan Lacy and a host of speedy receivers. Lacy, who runs hard but can also make people miss, has run for 445 yards and eight touchdowns. He is what Ole Miss did not have – or at least did not utilize – last season.
Speed, speed, speed on defense. The Rebels run to the football and hit hard when they get there. Pete Golding continues to do a masterful job. LSU ran the ball 21 times for 59 yards.
Inside stoppers on defense. This was a perceived weakness with the Rebels losing first round draft pick Walter Nolen and also JJ Pegues. But Ole Miss looks at least as proficient with gargantuan tackle Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles promoted to fill the void. LSU couldn’t block them.
A sound kicking game. With the Ole Miss offense, the Rebels punter is often much like the Maytag repairman, but Australian Oscar Bird has been excellent when called upon. Placekicker Lucas Carneiro has hit 11 of 12 field goals, including three of four beyond 40 yards. 

The Ole Miss schedule, by SEC standards, is doable. The Rebels don’t have to play Alabama, Texas, Texas A&M, Missouri or Vanderbilt (yes, I just wrote that). They do play both Georgia and Oklahoma both on the road and back-to-back. South Carolina is no gimme and neither is Mississippi State for that matter. But again, in the SEC, it could be a whole lot worse.
The Rebels have a week off, before Washington State, a 59-10 loser to North Texas, visits for homecoming. Then, it’s at Georgia and at Oklahoma, back to back.
Will the bubble burst? Or will Trinidad Chambliss, the best story in college football, add to seemingly tall tale? We shall see.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/28143349/AP25271000675535.jpg,,,2025-09-28 15:56:57.711039

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Authorities say 10 people were shot, at least one fatally, and a fire broke out Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, about 50 miles north of Detroit.
Grand Blanc Township police said on social media that the suspected shooter “is down” and there was no ongoing threat to the public, with Chief William Renye later telling reporters that the incident began at 10:25 a.m. when a 40-year-old Burton man he drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church.
“He then exited his vehicle, firing several rounds at individuals within the church. Ten gunshot victims have been transported to local hospitals at this time. Including one who has been deceased,” Renye said.
Officers, including with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Grand Blanc Township, arrived on the scene a short while later and “engaged in gunfire with that particular individual, neutralizing that suspect,” Renye said, adding that the fire is thought to have been deliberately set by the shooter.
Multiple law enforcement agencies have responded to Sunday’s incident in Grand Blanc, including the Michigan State Police, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office and the Genesee County Sheriff’s Office.
FBI Director Kash Patel said on social media that the bureau was monitoring reports of the “horrific shooting and fire” and was assisting in the investigation.
“Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act,” Patel said. “Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also shared a statement on social media, saying her “heart was breaking for the Grand Blanc community.”
“Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I am grateful for the first responders who took action quickly.”
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based  in Salt Lake City, issued a statement, saying they were “deeply grateful” for the outpouring of support from around the world. 
“In moments of sorrow and uncertainty, we find strength and comfort through our faith in Jesus Christ. Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” Doug Andersen, a church spokesperson said.
The shooting occurred less than 24 hours after  the death of the church’s president, Russell M. Nelson, who died Saturday at 101 years old.
The Grand Blanc Township incident follows another church-related shooting in late June when a man wearing tactical gear and carrying multiple firearms entered the CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan before being fatally shot by church security. 
The shooter’s mother in that incident was reportedly a church member, and he had attended services several times over the past year.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — After South Dakota Democrats heard appeals to organize, recruit and raise money, the keynote speaker at their Saturday night fundraiser urged them to do something else: hope.
Jaime Harrison, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told a story from his earlier job as floor director for the U.S. House Democratic Caucus. He recalled how a woman who was cleaning his Capitol office picked up a picture frame, recognized his mother in the photo, and said she went to high school with his mom and remembered when she dropped out of high school to give birth.
Harrison said the encounter brought them both to tears.
“And she came over and she hugged me and she said, ‘I would have never guessed that Patricia Harrison’s son would be right here. You give me hope.’”

Harrison said the story is a reminder that success is possible “no matter where you start.”
South Dakota Democrats are starting the 2026 campaign season with nobody in a statewide elected office. They had nine of the Legislature’s 105 members until earlier this month, when one of their members defected to the Republican Party and left them with eight.
One of those eight, Rapid City Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, told the crowd Saturday night that “I cannot begin to tell you how good it feels to be in a room of more than seven Democrats.” 
There were actually about 200 Democrats gathered in the DoubleTree hotel ballroom for the party’s annual western South Dakota fundraiser, which featured socializing, speeches and auctions benefitting the state party.
Harrison was the headliner. He chaired the Democratic National Committee from 2021 until earlier this year. Previously, he served as the first Black chairperson of the South Carolina Democratic Party and worked as an aide to U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn. Harrison also founded the Dirt Road Democrats political action committee, which works to engage rural voters, and he hosts a podcast called “At Our Table” that features conversations with guests about the nation’s challenges and hopes.
In his Saturday night speech, Harrison highlighted Uhre-Balk’s success. Last year, she became the first Democrat in 18 years to win a seat in her legislative district. According to her, if she wins again, she’ll be the first Democrat in 30 years to win two consecutive races in the district.

Harrison said the party needs more candidates to follow her lead and ignore the naysayers.
“She didn’t listen to them,” Harrison said. “She listened to all of you, and she stood up and she spoke out and she won.”
The prescription for more results like that, according to Harrison, includes a focus on recruitment.
“Do not leave any seat in South Dakota uncontested in 2026,” he said. “Not one.”
Democrats have a start toward that goal with declared candidates for offices including U.S. Senate, U.S. House and secretary of state. But their only declared candidate for governor so far is a 20-year-old college student, and they face a challenge recruiting candidates in legislative districts that lacked Democrats on the ballot last year.
Fundraising, meanwhile, has been a bright spot. The state party’s reports to the Federal Election Commission showed $341,000 of income from January through August. A July fundraiser in eastern South Dakota featuring Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz drew a crowd of about 1,000 people. 
The same period’s reports from the South Dakota Republican Party, which has undergone staff turnover including a new chairman in February, showed $41,000 of income.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-28 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi Museum of Art displays rare portraits of enslaved people,"Sophie Bates, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/28/mississippi-museum-art-rare-portraits-enslaved-people/,The only known pre-emancipation paintings of enslaved people in Mississippi are on display at the Mississippi Museum of Art.,"With powerfully haunting eyes and an enigmatic expression, “Portrait of Frederick,” an image of an enslaved man painted circa 1840, stares out at visitors of the Mississippi Museum of Art.
A little further into the museum is Delia, a Black woman dressed in red and wearing a headscarf who bears a similarly unknowable expression. The pair of portraits are the only known pre-emancipation paintings of enslaved people in Mississippi.
Now, for the first time, they are on display together for the public to see.
“I was mesmerized by the painting,” museum visitor Staci Williams said. “The colors, the expression. His humanity seemed to jump off of the page.”
The portraits evoke questions about who Frederick and Delia were, why they were painted and what went through their minds as their faces were captured stroke by stroke for generations to see.
“We don’t know, for example, if either of these people had the choice to sit for the portrait. We don’t know if they had the choice of what they were wearing when they were painted,” said Betsy Bradley, the Laurie Hearin McRee director of the museum. “They certainly weren’t allowed to own their own portrait.”
The museum bought “Portrait of Frederick” in partnership with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The museums will pass the portrait back and forth, each displaying it for several years at a time.
Bradley said purchasing the portrait brought up complicated feelings. Until emancipation freed him, Frederick was considered property. Now, more than 150 years later, his portrait is property, bought and sold to the highest bidder.
“If it enables us to have important conversations with each other about the human cost of slavery and why it mustn’t ever happen again, then having it in a public place can be meaningful,” Bradley said.
Since the 1860s, “Portrait of Frederick” has been displayed at Longwood, an antebellum mansion in Natchez, Mississippi, that belonged to the family of his enslavers. There, Frederick’s likeness was used to whitewash history.
According to research by the Neal Auction Company, which sold the painting to the Mississippi Museum of Art, tour guides in the 1970s informed the public that Frederick had grown up alongside his enslaver Haller Nutt, and the two were best friends. They claimed Nutt freed Frederick and referred to him by the belittling moniker “Uncle Frederick.”
In reality, Frederick oversaw other slaves on the plantation. He collected data on field production, analyzed growing conditions and acted as a manager. His role was important, and he and his family may have received better living conditions as a result.
Frederick was about 70 when the Civil War ended. He took the surname Baker and became ordained. Prior to emancipation, Black people were not allowed to marry. Frederick conducted weddings for at least 69 couples after it became legal.

Less is known about Delia. Her portrait was painted between 1840 and 1849. She appears to be sewing, which leads some to believe she worked inside her enslavers’ home. Delia’s portrait was kept by the descendants of her enslavers until the Mississippi Museum of Art bought it 2019.
Both portraits are unique in that Frederick and Delia are the sole subjects of the works. Oftentimes, Black people were painted alongside white people, likely as a way of underscoring the white person’s wealth.
Frederick is dressed in regal garb — something he likely would not have worn in his everyday role on the plantation. Both are depicted in a three-quarters composition, which was used for dignified and important subjects.
Upon looking at “Portrait of Frederick,” Williams said she felt a surprising mixture of pride and sadness.
“I wonder about what he’s thinking,” Williams mused. “He doesn’t seem to give anything away.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25154934/AP25256728817578.jpg,,,2025-09-28 09:56:31.964701

WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — The Veterans Affairs Healthcare System this week celebrated the completion of a $16 million, 24,000-square-foot renovation of a medical surgical unit at the White River Junction VA Medical Center.
The upgrade aims to provide accessible, modern health care for veterans, and make “the actual experience of being in the hospital as pleasant as possible,“ said Dr. Brett Rusch, the executive director of the White River Junction location.
While the unit, which covers the second floor of its building, previously looked and felt like a “40-year-old dormitory,” it now is a “state-of-the-art medical unit,” Rusch said.

Except for trauma, open heart surgery or open skull surgery, staff on the floor provide most types of specialty medical and surgical treatment, Rusch said. The facility performs an average of around 1,700 to 1,800 surgical cases per year, spokesperson Katherine Tang said in an email.
Beginning in December 2023, the Colchester-based Engelberth Construction company took the building “down to (the) studs,” optimizing square footage to maximize beds while creating space for movement around the unit, Rusch said.

As part of the renovation, the number of total beds in the unit decreased from about 42 to 37, Greg Auch, nurse manager of the medical surgical unit, said.
“Sacrificing a few beds, to reach the 37 beds now, allows us to break things apart to single rooms and a couple double-occupancy just to create a better experience,” Auch said.
The increased space also allows patients to receive more of their care within their rooms.

For example, there is space for in-room chest X-rays and bedside cardiograms, Auch said. Additionally physical therapy and fold-out couches for family members are moving into rooms, Rusch said.
Each individual room now also has its own temperature controls, Auch said.
Four nurse stations are now distributed across the floor to be as close to veterans as possible, in contrast to being centralized in two centers as they previously were, Rusch said.
Additionally, ceiling lifts that carry patients and could previously only go the length of certain rooms can now maneuver across the entirety of each room and into bathrooms, VA interior designer Kaitie Gillespie said.
Throughout the nearly two-year project, the facility was able to keep beds operational by working on one half at a time, Rusch said. Half of the beds moved downstairs during the construction, which was originally office space, Tang said.
The first half opened about six months ago, Rusch said.
The unit will fully open for patients in about two weeks, Gillespie said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Zachary Pratt: Vote no to Rutland City’s $3.9 million tax bond.","Dear Editor,


It is irresponsible for Rutland City to ask its voters to approve a $3.9 million tax increment financing bond at a time when the future of healthcare and other economic factors are unknown. Watching the Senate Finance Committee questioning the Secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. earlier this month makes me believe that Vermonters are being put in harm’s way by his leadership as the “Big Beautiful Bill” strips Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
Open enrollment for health coverage in Vermont runs yearly from November 1 to January 15, so for me to vote to approve a $3.9 million project is unthinkable, especially when healthcare benefit cuts, increased prices of homes and automobiles, and tariff increases on other types of products are all yet to come.
Additionally, Rutland City is undergoing a comprehensive property tax reappraisal to update property taxes to bring the home assessments in line with market values that have risen in recent years. It is wrong to ask city residents to vote yes on a bond before all of these are known.

This story by Patrick Bilow and Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Sept. 25, 2025.
After a long day of pedaling from Swanton to Morristown on the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, Paul Arthur of Vail, Colorado, didn’t have to look far for a quiet place to lay his head.
As the sun set over the Lamoille River, Arthur had pitched his tent on a soft patch of grass just steps away from the trail he’d been traveling. His bike, mounted with bags bursting at the seams with gear, was propped up by a strong stick, and Arthur was basking in the last sliver of sunlight available to him.
He’d found what he was looking for after dropping his son off at college a few days prior — something smooth and flat to pedal and reflect. The river murmured as it moved, and Arthur hadn’t seen another rider in hours.
“This is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had,” Arthur, 68, said. “Vermont is a biker’s paradise. I can’t believe no one else is out here right now.”After repeated floods waylaid its completion, towns are starting to see the full impact of a complete Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, which is attracting locals and out-of-town visitors like Arthur alike. Some ride and others walk or run. They come for day trips, launching from several different trailheads in Lamoille County, or they travel straight through Vermont, from New York to New Hampshire, stopping in towns along the way for provisions, repairs and libations.

Data provided by the Department of Transportation shows that, even if most towns along the rail trail only see the same amount of traffic they saw on their sections of the rail trail as they did the second half of last year, most of them are set to well exceed the previous year’s use. Graph courtesy of the Vermont Agency of Transportation
Data from counters installed by the Vermont Agency of Transportation that monitored traffic on the rail trail for the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025 shows that, if trends continue apace, that most stops on the trail are set to see usership far in excess of 2024, which department spokesperson Amy Tatko said reflected last year’s flooding-related closures.
The data also shows how the locally connected portion of the trail that runs through Lamoille County has helped develop ridership in those towns. Morrisville is clearly the most trafficked hub along the trail, while Cambridge, Johnson and Wolcott are also among the most popular access points, as towns like Fairfield have made inroads in the first half of this year.
Every town has benefited from a dry summer, as cyclists were able to travel unimpeded between Swanton and St. Johnsbury on the 93-mile former railway and one of the longest rail trails in New England, passing through five counties and 18 towns, including five Lamoille County towns along the way. Such a season has been a long time coming, even while a 17-mile Lamoille County portion of the trail has been open since 2016.
In 2023, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — who helped secure millions in federal funding to get the rail trail started in the 2000s — and Gov. Phil Scott — who has boosted the project and advocated for annual funding to maintain the trail — were set to walk portions of the trail in mid-July of that year as the complete version of the trail, decades in the making, was set to be unveiled.
But the flood of July 2023 hit just days before the big ribbon cutting, severely damaging portions of the rail trail and causing millions in damages in towns like Cambridge, Johnson, Morrisville, Wolcott, Greensboro and Hardwick.
Despite another flood hitting in early July 2024, which again damaged parts of the trail, the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail quietly opened last year to bikers looking to travel its full 93 miles.
Yva Rose, who operates Johnson-based Lamoille Valley Bike Tours with her husband Jim, has been keeping her own data of rail trail usership. Since 2016, she has seen the number of users steadily increase. In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the surge in outdoor recreation interest gave usership another big boost. The Roses’ plan to provide planning support, shuttle rides and bike rentals to riders along the full-length of the trail was torpedoed in 2023, which pushed potential riders to have cold feet even before the anniversary floods in 2024.
But the relatively dry summer this year has been a bounce-back season for the trail, with usership of the trail by her metrics having “quadrupled,” driven largely by a sector of outdoor enthusiasts that seek out the rail trail experience. Many towns along the trail have seen the cultural and commercial benefits already, even as they try to better position themselves to capitalize on their proximity to this economic engine of recreational tourism.
“There’s a community, a very large community, out there that spends their summers exploring rail trails,” Rose said. “Having our rail trail be 93 miles now and complete, without any flooding, has drawn a huge increase in rail trail tourism.”

Tranquility
Elona McNeil, 13, Shelburne
My funny little friend
appearing at my door,
day in and day out,
to say hello to me.
So intelligent
yet so silly,
chasing after fallen leaves and blades of grass.
Lying on the doormat
waiting for me to appear,
and sometimes,
when I do show up,
you stay sprawled right in front of the door,
unwilling to move,
saying,
Go around me –
you have other doors,
because you’re so comfortable.
The white fur on your stomach exposed as you roll around,
hooking your claws in the mat,
scratching,
pulling,
tugging,
brushing up against me,
wandering around the porch,
rubbing up against the box of chalk…
guarding our front porch
against what?
Only you really know,
pacing and nuzzling,
sitting and staring,
claiming this place as your own,
claiming me as your own.
You are my equal.
Sometimes I don’t understand you,
but most times
I just feel contentment and tranquility,
living in the moment, maybe,
having moved on from the past
and not having to worry about the future,
as the dappled sunlight between the leaves shines on your face,
as you close your eyes…
You never really sleep;
you’re just resting,
basking in the sunlight,
sleepy and calm after an exhausting day.
You know how to live –
can you teach the rest of us?

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-28 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Speaker Jason White wants citizens to be able to vote, but not on ‘school choice’",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/28/jason-white-school-choice-ballot/,Column: Speaker Jason White apparently does not want people to vote on whether public funds should be spent on private schools.,"House Speaker Jason White says he wants to restore the initiative process to allow citizens to place issues on the ballot.
But at the same time, White apparently does not want people to vote on the important issue of whether the state should expand its so-called “school choice” initiatives, which would provide more public funds to private schools.
His positions on two of what he calls his legislative priorities — restoring the initiative process to allow citizens to vote and expanding school choice options — seem to be incompatible.
White, the Republican House Speaker from West, has established a special committee to look at restoring the ballot initiative process, which allows voters to bypass the will of lawmakers and gather signatures to place issues directly on the ballot.
The state Supreme Court ruled Mississippi’s initiative process void in 2021 because it required a designated number of signatures be gathered from five U.S. House districts to place an issue on the ballot. The Supreme Court pointed out the state has had only four districts since 2000, thus the initiative process was invalid, even though other entities in state government are based on the five congressional districts.
Lawmakers vowed to fix the problem and quickly restore the initiative process. They still haven’t, and there’s no sign of any real movement to seek an agreement.
White has said he believes restoring the ballot initiative is important. But apparently he does not want school choice to be placed on the ballot for a vote of the citizens.
The speaker also has formed a special committee to look at expanding Mississippi school choice. The committee is expected to make recommendations before the start of the 2026 legislative session in January.
Though it may seem logical to do so, the committee does not seem interested in recommending a proposal be placed on the ballot to amend the Mississippi Constitution to repeal language that states explicitly that public funds cannot be provided to private schools.
Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution reads in part: “nor shall any funds be appropriated toward the support of any sectarian school, or to any school that at the time of receiving such appropriation is not conducted as a free school.”
That language is stunningly clear and concise, especially compared to some of the convoluted legalese often found in historical governing documents.
Multiple states have language in their constitutions prohibiting public funds from being spent on religious or sectarian schools. The courts have struck down that language, saying religious schools could not be discriminated against. But only the South Carolina Constitution has language similar to Mississippi’s restricting public funds from being spent on any private school — religious or non-religious.
If White and his special committee were serious about expanding the state’s school choice programs, they would start with amending Section 208. That could be done by the Legislature approving the proposal by a two-thirds vote of each chamber and then placing it on the ballot for voters to approve or reject.
Therein is the problem for the pro-voucher, school choice crowd. They know they cannot garner that two-thirds vote in both chambers of the Mississippi Legislature, and furthermore they cannot convince the public to pass such a proposal.
If they thought they could, they already would have placed such a proposal before the Legislature.
Instead, if the Legislature ever passes a proposal expanding school choice to private schools, they are counting on the Mississippi Supreme Court ignoring the plain language of the state constitution and ruling that public funds can be spent on private schools.
Of course, another option would be for the Legislature to finally restore the initiative process in Mississippi and allow voters to place a proposal on the ballot to repeal Section 208 language banning public funds from being spent on private schools.
But that is not likely to happen even if the Legislature restores the ballot initiative, which is also not likely to happen.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31115625/3X0A0245.jpg,,,2025-09-28 07:56:57.728551

As drought intensifies, depleting water levels are forcing towns to conserve water, harming aquatic ecosystems, and impacting recreational activities

In Berlin, an elder care facility that serves about 150 people saw all of its wells go dry. Now the town — which is getting 50% less water from its own wells — has to jury-rig a system to make sure Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center stays up and running. 
“I run a fire hose over to their storage tanks,” said Craig Pelletier, the town’s public works supervisor. 
Berlin isn’t alone. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, almost 94% of Vermont is in a severe drought, while almost 24% of the state is in an extreme drought, with Orange County, Windsor County and Rutland County being the most impacted.

Though many residents hoped recent rain would provide relief, any solace will be piecemeal. Rainfall throughout the week of Sept. 21 is “mostly going to be a drop in the bucket,” said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
After Sept. 28, warm temperatures accompanied with a high pressure system are expected to exacerbate the drought, Haynes said. 
One effect of climate change is that it often leads to a “swing between extremes,” Haynes said. In 2023, Vermont had its wettest summer on record, while this year’s summer has been extremely dry — a huge change in just a matter of two years, he said. 
According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, this past August has been the driest on record in Vermont since 1895.
With scientists predicting that drought will persist in the coming weeks, Vermonters say low water levels around the state are prompting towns to conserve water, affecting aquatic ecosystems, and creating barriers to recreation.
‘It’s just that bad, I guess’ 
In Berlin, one of the town’s four industrial-size wells recently went dry, Pelletier said. He estimates that the town’s overall water production is down by about 50%, he said.
The significant decline in production prompted Pelletier to issue a water conservation notice last week. The town issued the mandatory notice to its approximately 115 connected users, most of which are commercial businesses, Pelletier said. 
“This wasn’t a ‘pretty please’ thing. It was kind of, we need to do this to get through this drought together,” Pelletier said, referring to the notice.

Pelletier is working with state officials and well-drilling companies to see if the town can find a stopgap fix and reach some untapped aquifers underground to keep everyone up and running. 
“They’re drilled really deep. You know, they’re supposed to have plenty of storage — and it’s just that bad, I guess,” Pelletier said. 
Until then, he said, the town is carefully threading the needle. 
Neighboring city Montpelier issued a similar conservation notice on Sept. 18 after water levels in Berlin Pond, the city’s primary water source, dipped below the threshold for conservation. The city asked businesses and residents to cut back on water use and be mindful of when they’re turning on their taps. 
Another Washington County town, Plainfield, issued a conservation notice on Sept. 16. The town gets the majority of its water supply from a number of springs nearby, but those springs haven’t been able to meet the town’s demand in recent months, said Tristan MacGregor-Stewart, the town’s chief water system operator. 
Luckily, the town has a number of backup wells that it’s begun to draw from periodically since August. But pumping water from the wells is more expensive, MacGregor-Stewart said. The notice is a preliminary measure, to start conserving before the town has a big problem, he said.
One of Lunenburg’s fire districts is also under a water conservation notice. “Our water resources are depleted and the daily usage of customers needs to drop immediately,” said the town’s notice from Buddy Ball, the chief water systems operator.  
Since Aug. 22, the state has received 398 reports of drinking water supply shortages or outages, mainly from private homeowners, according to Ben Montross, with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, who said this is the worst drought he has seen statewide in 12 years. Of those reports, 77% represent shallow groundwater meaning a spring or a dug well, and 20% represent drilled wells.
Residents in Orange County, in the driest part of the state, submitted the most reports, making up 21% of all reported shortages. 
At least five water systems across the state have also reported using alternate sources of water, according to Stephanie Brackin, a spokesperson for the Agency of Natural Resources. Those neighborhoods range in location from Pownal to Newbury. 
It’s possible that more towns and cities are operating under water conservation notices, but municipalities aren’t required to alert state officials when they issue the local warnings, Brackin said. 
In Corinth, an Orange County town that was one of the first in Vermont to see extreme drought conditions, residents are suffering.

People who live in town have been going to the town hall for water because their wells have gone dry, said Martha Brough, the town’s clerk. Margaret Loftus, who owns a farm in town, said she’s heard of people showering in local schools. 
Low water levels 
While sources of drinking water are drying up around Vermont, lakes, rivers, and streams have also been drastically impacted.
“A number of them are recording their lowest value on record,” state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux said. 
Vermont is experiencing at least five types of droughts at once, according to Dupigny-Giroux. A meteorological drought, driven by scarce precipitation, has dried out soil and led to agricultural drought. As conditions worsened, lakes, rivers and streams were hit by a hydrological drought, while the impacts on food production and prices pushed the state into a socioeconomic drought.
“A lot of the impacts that we’re seeing were exacerbated by how quickly the summer drought kicked off, which is a flash drought,” Dupigny-Giroux said. The flash drought — a rapid onset drought that deteriorates quickly — began between June and July but then ramped up in August, she added. 
Although Vermont has experienced droughts in the past, what’s unusual this time, Dupigny-Giroux said, is that the state has been experiencing a flash drought coupled with the hydrological drought since last year. 
“I spent most of my life in and around Lake Champlain ever since I was a kid, and I really have not seen water levels like this before,” said Julie Silverman, Lake Champlain lakekeeper with the Conservation Law Foundation. 
During her monitoring activities in the lake, Silverman said she was struggling to paddle to Law Island in Lake Champlain due to the lower water level. “People are actually able to walk to islands and other parts of Lake Champlain that they’ve never really had access to before by foot,” she said.
The fluctuations the lake has experienced between floods and extreme drought impact the entire ecosystem, Silverman said. “These are really dramatic extremes that put a tremendous amount of stress on animals as well as plants.”
“The lake is so low that we’ve lost a lot of shallow water habitat,” said Jason Stockwell, director of the Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Laboratory at the University of Vermont. “The decrease in water level will affect the availability of such habitat for young fish to find food to eat and also to hide from predators.”
As the water level decreases, and the water temperature rises, different species are forced to share a shrinking band of livable habitat, with surface waters too warm and low-oxygen areas at the bottom of the lake expanding, according to Stockwell. 
The phenomenon intensifies competition among species, Stockwell said, leaving fish such as rainbow smelt, which would normally be in cold waters at the bottom of the lake, more vulnerable to predators and exposing spawning sites to anglers, wind storms and waves.
According to Dupigny-Giroux, the state climatologist, collecting data on drought impacts can help determine if Vermont is also going through an ecological drought, in which the landscape changes and cannot be reverted to what it once was. If some streams become permanently dry or some species leave and don’t come back next year, for example, the state would have experienced an ecological drought.
For this reason, Vermont officials encourage people to report drought impacts they notice across the state. 
“Reporting impacts, reporting any observations are so critical for us to be able to piece together all of the parts of this jigsaw,” state climatologist Dupigny-Giroux said.

Limits to recreation
While Vermont’s water bodies run low, Vermonters are seeing their aquatic activities limited around the state. 
In Burlington, “several weeks ago, we actually started to move boats that were in more shallow areas,” said Robert Peterson, the city’s Parks, Recreation and Waterfront’s marina manager.
Peterson said they had to move 10 or 12 boats from Perkins Pier to the Burlington Boathouse Marina, which is deeper, and pull some boats at the Boathouse Marina further back into the water or move them to deeper slips. 
“We’ve certainly had low lake levels before, but just not to this extent and not this early,” he said.
Joe Tyson, state parks regional manager for the Northwest region of Vermont, said park staff have been contacting people with reservations at the park to inform them that, with water levels so low, it may be challenging to access the parks by boat or launch a boat from there, especially with motor boats. 
“At Grand Isle State Park and Burton Island State Park, we proactively reached out to folks to let them know that it’s going to look different this year than it has in the past,” Tyson said.
Victoria Edwards-White, coach of the rowing team at the University of Vermont, said the team generally heads to Lake Champlain from the Lamoille River, but lately they have been facing some challenges due to the low water levels. While the boats used by the athletes aren’t very deep, the coaches drive boats with outboard motors that go deeper into the water, which are needed to reach the athletes in case there are any problems. 
“We’re getting to the point where, if we don’t see any rain in the next few weeks, we are at risk of not being able to operate at all,” Edwards-White said, adding that a lower water level would risk damaging their equipment. 
With low water levels, weeds and reeds are getting stuck in the oars and the engines, Edwards-White said, and the team hasn’t been able to access part of the river because of that.
On other bodies of water around the state, anglers are feeling the impacts of low water levels on their local fishing spots. 
Nick Mahood, who oversees the fly-fishing program at the Woodstock Inn & Resort, said his guides usually lead groups on fishing trips into the Ottauquechee River, the White River and smaller tributaries near Woodstock. But this year’s low water levels have completely changed the game. 
“The water levels are so low, we’ve had to pretty much completely stop any sort of small stream creek fishing for brook trout or native wild trout. That’s been really challenging,” Mahood said. 
His guides no longer consider smaller rivers suitable for fishing, and the program hasn’t been able to fish the Ottauquechee River in the last five or six weeks, Mahood said. 
Fishing for trout is usually a big part of the inn’s program, Mahood said. But when water 
runs low, its temperature rises faster, even in large rivers. 
Trout don’t do well in water above 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and this year, water temps surpassed that marker early in the summer, leaving anglers to fish mostly smallmouth bass in the White River, he said. 
Northeast of Mahood is Bob Shannon, who owns the Fly Rod Shop in Stowe, a business that also takes anglers out on guided trips. In the fall, he mostly books trips to fish brook trout on mountain streams. Usually he takes groups out to Miller Brook, Ranch Brook, Notch Brook and Gold Brook — but this year those streams are so low there isn’t enough water to fish in them.
Shannon has adapted by mostly taking groups to ponds and lakes nearby, but sometimes that isn’t the trip more experienced anglers want — and he’s seen it affect his business. 
“Most of our fly fishing clients would rather fish in moving water on, you know, a beautiful fall foliage stream,” Shannon said.

Rising costs have defined the past six years for Dayna DePalma.
It wasn’t something she thought much about growing up in New Jersey with parents who both worked good jobs, who lived in a beautiful house. But in 2019, while in rehabilitation recovering from a drug addiction, she found out she was pregnant with her daughter. As a single mom, she moved back in with her parents and eventually started working at her child’s day care just so she could get the 50 percent discount that made it affordable. After six months, she left that job for a better one and now works in logistics.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network. 

But it wasn’t until this month, after months of looking for a place to live, that she was finally able to rent her own apartment. Her daughter just started kindergarten. DePalma has been sober for six years.
“Just being a single mom, it’s really hard to have a savings in general. I feel like I live paycheck to paycheck just with basic needs supporting her and myself,” said DePalma, 28.
Costs only keep creeping up, and she’s not sure what comes next. Saving enough to make the move was several years of work. DePalma has no savings, nothing squirreled away for retirement. Homeownership feels like a farfetched dream.
“I just feel like it’s going to be impossible to be able to own a home,” she said. “My anxiety levels have been through the roof regarding money.”
That’s a familiar story for most women these days, not just DePalma. The rising cost of living is squeezing women much more than men, and they report more concern about how they’re going to pay their bills, according to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll.
In every category surveyed — groceries, housing, child care, medical bills and retirement — women are more likely to say they are worried about covering those expenses. About 67% of women said they are worried about the cost of housing, compared with 60 percent of men. More than two-thirds of women are worried about the cost of groceries, while just over half of men are. Among parents, 52% of women are stressed about the cost of child care; 45% of men said the same.
SurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.

In recent months, prices for most necessities have again been rising, and changes from the Trump administration could make affordability more out of reach: Last month saw the largest rise in food prices in nearly three years; costs are up 29 percent from the start of the pandemic. Upcoming cuts to SNAP, the food stamps program, will make accessing benefits that lower that burden even harder. And housing costs, though they are starting to level out from their post-pandemic peak in 2022, are still outpacing inflation. Rising tariffs, which took effect last month, are only expected to worsen both.
The cost of child care is also outpacing inflation, averaging $13,128 annually in 2024, a 29 percent increase from 2020. And medical bills are soon expected to increase for those on Medicaid — the lowest-income Americans — and especially women and children after Congress cut more than $1 trillion from the program over the next decade.
On retirement, a spending package that passed Congress this year will provide a tax break to Americans 65 and older, but it will also make the Social Security trust insolvent by 2032, meaning retired women — the majority of Social Security beneficiaries — could see cuts to their incomes in the coming years.
If Americans are worried, it’s easy to see why. It’s also no mystery why women may be worried even more: Women make the majority of consumer purchases for their families and face rising grocery costs head on. Those costs are going to make it harder to pay for other needs, like rent; women are more likely to be renters, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be spending over a third of their earnings on housing alone.
If they’re parents of young kids, their other big line-item expense is probably child care, which for those with two or more children now exceeds the cost of the average rent or mortgage in most states. And if child care falls through, women are the ones most likely to have to leave work to stitch together care or leave the labor force altogether. Perhaps they’re missing work because their child is sick. Women are more likely to shoulder health care expenses for kids because they are primary caregivers, while also themselves facing higher health care costs on average because they go to the doctor more frequently for things like prenatal and reproductive care. After all of that is tallied up, what is left for retirement? Thanks to historic inequality, about 30% less than men.
What to know about the Classic Learning Test, the conservative alternative to the ACT 

“The shift in who does all the bill paying over the last generation — it’s not just that women do the shopping, they are also frequently the ones handling the mortgage check, paying the credit card bills, definitely looking at the after care bills or the child care bills,” said Mike Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.
And while men tend to view the economy more individualistically, women are making decisions across the whole family’s bank account, Madowitz said, while also taking the kids to the doctor and drawing up the grocery list.
“It’s both like women are in fact the accounting department and the manufacturing floor,” he said.
That view into household finances has made it so, historically, women have consistently felt worse about the economy than men. Because they tend to have fewer earnings and more caregiving responsibilities outside the home, they feel the impact of higher costs first.
Women of color feel it most of all.
In the 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll, Latinas, especially, consistently reported higher rates of worry than any other group across nearly all categories except retirement. On groceries, 77% of Latinas reported feeling worried about growing costs, compared with 69% of White women. It was the same for child care (47% versus 28%), housing (77% versus 63%), and medical bills (73% versus 69%).
Black women also had far higher rates than their White counterparts, especially when it came to food and housing costs. Since early this year, Black women’s unemployment rate has been rising far quicker than for other groups, from 5.1% in March to 6.7% in August. It’s currently at its highest rate in four years.
Now, the arrival of higher tariffs on most countries is adding a new stressor to the mix that is already showing up in the inflation data.
“There are things like groceries where we know it’s gonna show up really fast and that’s obviously stressful because you’re seeing it right away, and also you’re seeing it right away in places where it’s not particularly easy to cut your spending,” Madowitz said. “But then there’s all this stuff where it’s not showing up right away, and on some level that also produces anxiety because you’re like, ‘Well, I know this is coming.’”
That feeling of uncertainty has been hanging over Nicole Taetsch and her family of four in New Jersey. Taetsch has her own consulting business focused on marketing and business development, and her husband works with real estate investment properties. They have a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old and make a pretty good living, “and still, it’s tight,” she said.
“Everything post-pandemic has gone up, and then the uncertainty of everything: Costs have never really come down, then tariffs have only added to it. There’s all sorts of different pressures,” said Taetsch, 43.
If they had another child “what would we do?” Taetsch said. “There is nowhere to move in our area. We couldn’t buy anything here.”
Even recently, as she did the kids’ fall shopping at Old Navy, she noticed those prices had increased. The same is true at the grocery store. Taetsch hosts a podcast on parents and politics, and her most recent episode discussed exorbitant grocery prices for healthy food items. It was inspired by a LinkedIn post from food importer Greg Santollo about a bowl of cut fruit at Whole Foods with a $35 price tag.
She and her husband, Taetsch said, “are just very cognizant of the fact that prices are going up, there is absolutely no social safety net, the government isn’t making any policies to help the average American, they are only making it harder through taking away people’s health care, not doing anything to improve our health system, not doing anything to invest in our schools or public education or child care — the things that parents need.”
Taetsch grew up with a single mother and feels like “there is no way that, today, the lifestyle of a single mom raising two kids is anywhere near how my mom was able to raise us.”
For women of her generation, she said, “I feel like the cards are so broadly stacked against us.”

Health security means that we get care that’s effective, competent, quick, and kind—with no more than tiny co-payments and no worry about medical debt. To redeem the promise of plastic insurance cards, health security requires having enough good doctors, dentists, nurses, hospitals, and other caregivers where we need them.   
That doesn’t make health security for all easy to win—just easier than housing, education and job training, global warming, personal and national security, decent living standards, or the other huge challenges we face. Because we already spend enough on health care to get the job done.  
Unfortunately, we won’t get even one step closer to affordable health security for all by nibbling around the edges of the problem. That includes following the well-intentioned but deeply flawed recommendations that the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Sarah Iselin, set out in a recent CommonWealth Beacon commentary.  
Her proposed remedies are modest. Even so, they are not likely to be implemented. If they were, they would do little good because they don’t attack—or even identify—the causes of high costs, weak access, and caregiver shortages. How can a problem be successfully treated if it isn’t correctly diagnosed?  
Blue Cross’s imaginary world 
Iselin asserts that “Our state has a chance to make big changes in our health care system right now—the kind of transformation that can only come about in a crisis.”  
But who in our state will take that chance? Most politicians mean well but none yet face strong political pressure to fix health care. Our governor wasn’t elected because she knew a lot about health care. Our legislative leadership knows less—apart from a few terrific committee chairs.  And the Health Policy Commission’s two new members are the head of the state hospital association and a drug company executive, each an informed insider who seeks not transformation but simply higher revenue for their sector.  
Many citizens and caregivers are suffering already, but their crisis hasn’t translated into political pressure for serious change.    
When it comes to lobbying in Massachusetts, it’s no surprise that health insurers, hospitals, and others in health care are eight of the top 12 spenders, as reported earlier this year.   
Iselin claims that “We have an excellent track record in our state of collaboration between health plans, clinicians, business, labor, and policymakers.” Sure, but that happy harmony has been lubricated by ever more money each year for business as usual. The throats of that harmonious chorus will go dry after the last remaining dollar is pumped out of the financial aquifer.  
State government has for decades refused to put its arms around health care and understand our cost or access or caregiver problems—or their causes. It did pass a law in 2012 requiring an assessment of needed hospitals and other caregivers, but then simply walked away from implementing that law. So state government still doesn’t know which hospitals are needed, or how many doctors we need or even have. And it has refused to forge the financial and legal tools to sustain needed caregivers. 
Still, it’s encouraging that so many smart and knowledgeable and dedicated people already work in health care in state government and elsewhere. They will be able to help fix our health care, once the people at the top face political pressure to get serious.  
For now, though, we have good reason to worry. Many insured people couldn’t afford out-of-pocket costs of needed care before the cuts from Trump’s big tax and spending bill. About a dozen million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage owing to the budget bill. Up to another dozen million could lose Affordable Care Act coverage if Congress refuses to extend Biden’s extra subsidies, which expire in December.  
Most Massachusetts hospitals are already losing money. Many nursing homes are in bad financial shape. Many people—even with insurance through the job—can’t find a family doctor who takes new patients.  Or afford high deductibles and co-pays and co-insurance.

Bad as this is, it isn’t the crisis. It’s the storm clouds and heavy rain that precede the hurricane. The health care crisis is probably a few years away—when Congress does something drastic—like freezing all federal health spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA subsidies.   
Why might Congress do that? Because it will face a massive federal budget crisis—one fueled by international tensions, reckless tax cuts, a $2 trillion deficit in good economic times, discord between two dysfunctional political parties, and the many competing demands for public dollars.   
That very real crisis could politically galvanize health care reform, but sudden pressure for change will be worthless without advance preparation.   
The remedies advanced today don’t help us prepare.   
Iselin bemoans higher costs for medical care and medications, and the high share of our citizens who delay care owing to its cost.  
One of her proposed remedies is greater reliance on value-based payment. This is tied to rewarding health outcomes, not volumes of care. Both notions have been wildly oversold. They simply haven’t saved any serious money, as both the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have finally admitted.  
One big reason value-based payment doesn’t work is that payers find it very hard to devise trustworthy ways to measure the value of doctors’, hospitals’, and other caregivers’ services. Especially since the caregivers control the evidence and can game the payment method if they wish. Financially incentivizing caregivers to pursue “value” induces them to think more and more intensely about ways to maximize their own incomes and less about us as patients. For-profit Medicare Advantage plans respond the same way.   
More important, high volumes of care aren’t America’s problem. Doctor visits here are only 60 percent of the average across all rich democracies, and hospital admissions are 80 percent of that average. 
Care volumes are low here partly because high out-of-pocket payments deter many of us from seeking care. But the high out-of-pocket costs have been fostered by federal and state policies that try to turn American patients into kamikaze pilots in the war against high health care costs.  
Relying on patients—the least powerful and least informed group in the health care universe—to shop wisely for health care is a sick joke. It’s wrong to rely on suppressing access to care as a main cost control technique. Doing so manifests public and private payers’ unseriousness about cost control. And their stunted empathy for people who can’t afford high out-of-pocket costs.   
Another proposed remedy is finally enforcing the state’s “benchmark” for spending increases. In 2012, the Legislature created the Health Policy Commission and charged it with setting a yearly benchmark for the percentage rise in health care spending. But the HPC’s statutory authority is feeble. It took years, after the fact, to even try to recoup heavy overspending by Mass General Brigham. With health care spending increases widely disseminated, enforcing the benchmark on dozens of hospitals and others would be an administrative and legal nightmare.  
Other proposals call for a medication affordability board, hospital price controls, shifting surgery to allegedly cheaper ambulatory surgery centers, greater emphasis on primary care, and finding ways to ensure that for-profit groups like Steward play nicely.  
Yes, negotiating affordable drug prices is a good idea. But do individual states have the willingness, the buying power, or the political support to leverage lower prices?   
Even federal action on drug prices has been feeble. It took two decades for Congress to require Medicare to negotiate prices for its 10 costliest drugs. But the resulting prices remain almost triple the Western European average. There’s still little political will to take on the drug makers.   
Only one state has acted effectively to rein in hospital spending. Step by step, over five decades, Maryland has established a small, uniquely powerful and experienced state agency to set adequate budgets for all needed hospitals.   
This requires learning which hospitals and which services are actually needed, and how much it should cost to efficiently deliver care. Politically, the Maryland arrangement was possible partly because hospital trustees—who cared about their hospitals but also about costs of health insurance—controlled the state hospital association. A few other states have been taking baby steps to follow Maryland, but Trump may stop them in their tracks.   
Also, in response to Maryland’s success in slowing hospital spending, considerable care has been shifted from hospitals to ambulatory surgery centers. This doesn’t save money—it simply sorts the dollars into different boxes. Worse, ambulatory surgical centers have very high profits and underserve Medicaid patients. The lesson? Individual reforms must be coordinated.   
Primary care? It’s been like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does anything real about it. A big reason is that no one is accountable for making sure we have enough primary caregivers to serve all 7 million Massachusetts residents. Not Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, or other payers. Not medical schools. Not teaching hospitals that train residents. And not state government.   
Sadly, reforming for-profit hospitals or insurance companies simply isn’t possible. The problem isn’t Steward, its deleterious and disgraced former CEO, or private equity. Focusing on them is like the French army preparing to fight the last war. Complete market failure in health care means we can’t trust greedy profit-seeking to give us the innovation, efficiency, and cost-cutting—or the provision of needed and effective care—that real markets would deliver.  
The real world 
US health spending this year will be $5.6 trillion. That’s six times defense spending and triple all education spending. In Massachusetts, health care spending this year will total about $140 billion, or roughly $20,000 per person—about one-third above the US average.   
This should be enough to pay for the care that works for all of us who need it. Most of the world’s other rich democracies have worked this out. We can, too.  
Massachusetts and US health care have become financially addicted to more money each year to finance business as usual. The grave health care crisis—the actual hurricane—will arrive when the new money stops flowing. The freeze in federal health spending, mentioned earlier, is one of the possible sparks for explosive changes. It will threaten caregiver bankruptcies and much greater suppression of needed patient care.

The first response by hospitals, doctors, and drug makers to the freeze will be to try to raise the prices they get from insurance companies, money supplied by the employers who pay insurers’ bills. But with family premiums already over $30,000 yearly, private employers and also state and local governments will say no to higher prices.  
Their second response, discussed shortly, will be very different.   
But why isn’t current spending enough? Because up to half of what we spend on health care is wasted.  

On care that isn’t effective or isn’t needed or has enormous cost but low clinical value. Or that lacks continuity and coordination owing to shortages of primary care and the loss of lower-cost community hospitals.  


On vast paperwork that stems from deep mistrust between payers and caregivers—and the resulting upcoding, downcoding, prior authorization denials, and litigation—and from the astonishing complexity of coverage and error-prone bill-paying.  


On very high prices for needed drugs, devices, and other things. (Americans are 4 percent of the world’s people but we give the world’s drug makers 50 percent of their worldwide revenue, and an even greater share of their profits. That’s not affordable and it’s not right.)  


And on outright theft. Complex payment methods, market thinking that applauds greed, belief that health care theft is a victimless crime, and short-handed prosecutors who negotiate no-contest plea deals all help sustain theft.  

Overall, we waste so much because we rely on free market competition to contain cost and on government action to regulate our way out of problems. Neither works. 
The conclusion that competitive free market simply does not work in health care is a pragmatic assessment, not an ideological one. (I think free markets are a good idea, where they actually exist.) Not one of the seven requirements for a genuine free market is—or can be—remotely well-satisfied in health care. 
Market failure means that we don’t get innovation, lower costs, or the care we need and pay for. But we waste time and effort by trying to shoehorn size-12 health care realities to fit into size-5 market fantasies. This is a bipartisan problem. Both Democrats and Republicans talk about anti-trust suits against hospital mergers but neither does much. Both parties push caregivers to post prices on web sites, but the numbers are generally useless—and unused.   
At the same time, government’s energies have been diverted into trying to regulate to clean up the many messes that the failed market leaves in its wake. It acts like the worker with the wheelbarrow and shovel who follows the circus parade.  
Steward is the latest acute example. The state’s cost benchmarks’ failure to limit spending is a chronic example. Low-quality nursing home care is a third. Widely disseminated theft in health care is a fourth. Governments write regulations that are hard to enforce; failed enforcement undermines confidence in competent public action.  
Failed markets and incompetent government mean health care anarchy. Anarchy means weak accountability for financial coverage, for actual access to care, for cost control, or for securing the right doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers in the right places.  It means more waste.   
In a few years, the explosive health care financial crisis will provide the energy to blast loose most of the vast dollars now wasted inside Massachusetts and US health care.  
Hospitals and doctors will support reform when their alternative is bankruptcy or deep income cuts. Patients will support reforms that guarantee needed care that’s affordable. Employers will finally recognize that they can’t rein in their own costs. Politicians will try to catch up.  
Real reform requires crafting an alternative to markets that can’t work. And to traditional reactive government regulations that can’t work. We can look at the arrangements prevailing in most of the world’s other rich democracies—nations that successfully, though not perfectly, protect all their people, give more health care, spend one-half as much per person, and live longer.  
Here’s what that would mean.  
First, an insurance card for each person, one requiring no more than nominal out-of-pocket payments. Back the cards financially with the dollars already available. Give up on trying to save money by suppressing patients’ use of care by making out-of-pocket burdens unaffordable or doctor appointments unavailable or waits for mental health care intolerable.  
Second, redeem the plastic cards clinically with adequately financed budgets for needed hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and other institutions. And for the right types and numbers of doctors in the right places. If we want more primary care doctors, we have a choice between drafting them and paying them more money.  Much more.  And slashing their paperwork.  And supporting them with NPs and PAs.   
This means careful public action to identify needed caregivers and pay them enough to finance efficient delivery of needed care. It also means paying caregivers in ways that allow us to trust them to spend our huge but finite dollars effectively, equitably, and frugally. That’s a tall order.    
Third, a yearly cap on national and state-level health care spending. This means putting health care on a budget. Making that work requires caregivers and managers who are accountable for spending our vast—but inevitably finite—health care dollars as well as possible.  
The first three actions require strategic legislation. Making the big strategic decisions well can set health care on a path to affordable self-regulation by caregivers. If governments don’t make the big decisions well, they will be pressured to continue to make lots of micro regulatory decisions. It will remain impossible to make those competently or efficiently. Or enforce them. 
Fourth, recognize that free markets and government regulatory micro-management don’t and can’t work in health care. The resulting anarchy means that no one is accountable for ensuring good care for all people, containing cost, or sustaining the right caregivers in the right places.   
To assure good and affordable care for all—to balance access and cost—there’s probably only one workable alternative to failed markets and incompetent government regulatory micro-management.  
It turns out that individual doctors’ decisions about how to diagnose and treat us control and spend almost 90 cents on the health care dollar. So we have to put our money in doctors’ hands under arrangements that allow us to trust them to spend it as well as possible—to do as much clinical and human good as possible.  
That means paying doctors well, but in financially neutral ways that don’t incentivize them to give unneeded care or deny valuable care. This means seeing physicians as fiduciaries, not MBAs. It probably means salaries (large ones) for doctors working in hospitals and other trustworthy arrangements for doctors working in ambulatory care.  
Greater physician altruism will help. So will a simple bargain: Doctors, we will get rid of almost all of your payment-related paperwork, including prior authorizations. And we will even end medical malpractice suits—and craft alternative ways to compensate patients who are harmed by bad care. But only if you agree to serve as clinical and financial fiduciaries for your patients.  
Doctors’ better decisions will weed out clinical waste. Especially when supported by hospital trustees and managers who also act as fiduciaries—helping doctors get as much clinical value as possible for patients out of finite hospital budgets. That will require making better evidence available on effective and affordable ways to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries.   
Paying doctors and hospitals in simple and trustworthy ways will slash administrative waste.  
Capping drug prices or negotiating deals with drug makers will make needed meds affordable for all. This can be matched with big dollar prizes for competing labs that develop effective and safe new meds.   
Simplifying the flows of money inside health care will cut opportunities for theft. Health care theft and fraud are not impulsive. They are calculated. Catching more crooks and imposing serious jail time on those who steal will help deter further crime. Capping spending will make it clear to everyone that theft kills. This will spur more whistle-blowers to come forward.  
Fifth, since market failure means that profit-seeking isn’t legitimate, outlaw for-profit caregivers and insurance companies. Buy up owners’ equity by floating 20-year bonds.  
You may not think a crisis is coming. You might be right.  
US and Massachusetts health care might continue to muddle through. Some hospitals will close; others will lay off nurses and other workers. And cut money-losing services. ER delays will grow. Access to care will get a little worse each year. More paperwork and private insurance companies’ denial of care will drive us a little crazier each year, but only slowly. AI will automate the job of making us crazy. Employers will boost out-of-pocket costs to slow premium increases. Anxious not to upset organized lobbies of caregivers, drug makers, and insurance companies, politicians will continue to do as little as possible.  
But you might be wrong. If a grave crisis does arrive, and political pressure for reform becomes irresistible, will we know what to do? It’s a bad idea to defer sewing parachutes until the plane’s engine has stopped.   


The best insurance policy we could craft for our health care is to begin right now to plan what to do if the crisis hits. Crisis means an opportunity to fix all that’s wrong with our health care. But only if we prepare in detail.   
Broad and deep planning is vital because health care itself is so complicated—and because reform is even more complicated. Also because it’s essential to minimize disruption to patient care and to conserve the valuable and intricately organized networks of caregivers we rely on.   
The premium for this policy would cost a few million dollars yearly for five years or so. That  money would establish a state government office to plan the responses to the many challenges that a health care financial crisis will present. Some of the jobs entail preparing state government to make essential strategic decisions. Others involve orienting doctors and other caregivers toward balancing the financial and clinical books—the pressures to care for all citizens of Massachusetts effectively, equitably, and efficiently—with the vast but finite dollars available.   
Some of the individual jobs include:  

Sustaining the flow of revenue into health care, to protect access and to keep all needed hospitals, doctors, dentists, nursing homes, hospices, and other caregivers out of bankruptcy 


Assessing the current availability and locations of care—from hospitals, doctors, dentists, nurses, nursing homes, mental health, and other caregivers 


Learning how much hospital inpatient capacity we require, where it should be located, and how much it should cost to deliver efficiently  


Learning which types of doctors we need, how many, and in which locations 


Designing ways to fill gaps between current capacity and need—and of implementing those designs  


Starting today to rapidly rebuild primary care capacity—and also dental care capacity 


Learning how to cap cost of care at affordable levels—and securing revenue commensurate with that cost  


Crafting ways to pay doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers that are financially neutral, adequate to keep caregivers reasonably happy, simple to administer, and affordable to all of us to provide the money 


Promoting an altruistic and fiduciary outlook for all caregivers 


Designing a financial-clinical-political deal with caregivers, one that lifts today’s oppressive and time-consuming administrative burdens, pays them well, and liberates them to spend our health care dollars to do as much good as possible 


Addressing prescription drug prices and incentivizing development of valuable new meds 


Assuring worried patients that health care is working for them—since pathology is remorseless but resources are always finite, how to build citizens’ trust—such that the only reason one patient doesn’t get certain costly care is to liberate doctors’ time and hospitals’ nurses and dollars to deliver care that’s more valuable?  


Developing ways to identify and respond to problems and complaints from patients, caregivers, payers, and politicians 


Integrating the pieces so they fit by developing timelines for each activity and coordinating revenue, budgets and other caregiver payments, access and equity and quality of care.  

Affordable high-quality health care for all of us should be the easiest aim to attain because we already spend enough.  Nations that are realistic about health care—and that don’t tolerate wasting one-half of their health care spending—cope continuously with the challenges a deep crisis would mean. It’s time Massachusetts state government took those challenges seriously. It’s time to begin to organize the efforts of the many competent and smart people working in and out of state government to plan to respond to the crisis—if, or when, it hits.  
The alternative will be to accept that a health care crisis would hit us like a Pearl Harbor attack—unready to respond.   
Preparing to fix health care will help us win a victory for compassion and competence—one that will liberate money and attention to address the tougher problems that confront us.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-28 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This Ukrainian family fled war in Odesa and found a foothold in CT,Shahrzad Rasekh,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/28/ct-ukraine-odesa/,Evgenia Natsevych fled Ukraine with her family in October 2022. A twisting path brought them to Connecticut more than a year later.,"On a cold, rainy day in late March, Evgenia Natsevych lifted her daughter Angelina, allowing the 7-year-old to peer through the waiting room window of a New Haven dentist’s office. 
“I want her to see the ocean,” she said, pointing to Long Island Sound. “We had the sea in Odesa.”
Angelina began experiencing tooth pain in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Three years later, her mother was finally able to get her care through Connecticut’s Medicaid insurance, known as HUSKY.
Caught in the whirlwinds of war and migration, Evgenia and her family are just a few of the 120,000 Ukrainians who arrived in the U.S. through a program known as Uniting for Ukraine (U4U). Created under the Biden administration, the program has been paused indefinitely by the Trump administration. As the intensity of the war escalates, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Ukrainians to seek refuge in the U.S.
Evgenia’s story, like many Ukrainians’, transcends borders. The war opened up her family photo album and scattered its pages. 

As Evgenia resettled in the U.S. on October 2022 with her husband and children, her mother and stepbrother resettled in Germany. Her father and stepfather remained in Ukraine. Her father is his ill wife’s caregiver, and her stepfather is a hospital director and a first responder to airstrikes.
It was in the midst of these changes and the uncertainty of their family’s residency status that Evgenia and her husband Vitalii finally began to find steadiness — in Connecticut.

War at home
In the early morning of Feb. 24, 2022, Evgenia was sleeping with her 3-year-old daughter Emma in their home in Odesa, Ukraine, when she was woken by a loud noise. She called her husband Vitalii out of bed. 
“It’s a firework,” she recalled him saying. Moments later, as they stood in front of their bedroom window, a missile flew by, close enough for them to discern its shape. Then the sky went white with another bang. 
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun.
Later that morning, Evgenia’s phone glowed with messages pouring in from the WhatsApp group chat for Angelina’s nursery.
“Is anyone going to day care today?” asked one mom. “We are operating as usual,” answered a teacher.
Evgenia and Vitalii’s home had no basement, and it was near a military station, which they worried would be a target. They decided to leave. 
“I had one hour to pack everything. So I got my plant, I got my camera or something like that, a few books, and that’s it,” Evgenia said. “We didn’t realize what’s going on. We thought we would just take some stuff, but it’s not forever.”
It was one of many moments, at the time and since, that residents of Odesa have had to weigh whether to leave. And it wasn’t a clear call.
Just a few evenings earlier, Evgenia’s university friend Julia Abramova had come over for dinner. They prepared burgers, and Julia had sat between Evgenia’s two daughters, little Emma and Angelina, whom she adored. 
As Evgenia was considering her options, Julia was panicking, pacing around her apartment. After a few hours of indecision, she began throwing things into a suitcase. “It’s hard when you can see all of your life in one luggage,” Julia said. 
Ultimately, Julia decided to remain in Odesa — and she’s still there, living through the frequent drone strikes that have only grown in number. She and Evgenia haven’t seen each other since that evening they made dinner together.

Evgenia documented her thoughts on social media as she and her family made the drive north to her inlaws’ house. “We took the most valuable thing — the children,” she said in one Instagram story. “There are many other pieces of life left.” 
Those physical remnants of memories can’t be replaced: her late grandmother’s strawberry plants and tulips, which Evgenia had planted in her home. Or the piano, which she had had shipped across the country after her grandmother’s death so her daughters could learn to play. 
“What if I don’t come back,” she continued in the social media story. “Or there’s nowhere to come back to.”
The family thought they’d be safer with Vitalii’s parents, farther north in Ukraine. But soon after they arrived, they discovered they were just over a dozen miles from the Kyiv battle lines, where Russian and Ukrainian forces were fighting for control of the capital. By the third day of the invasion, the house shook and sirens wailed. 
The three generations took shelter in the unfinished basement, where Evgenia continued to work remotely as a marketing manager. Then she began to develop sensitivity to certain odors. She was pregnant. 
“Oh god,” she thought. “Why now?”
Evgenia’s belly grew as Russia’s military bombed hospitals and maternity wards. She read reports of pregnant women moved to hospital basements and didn’t want to become one of them.
“I decided that I have to go out (of the country) somewhere, at least to have my baby. Because I was scared.” She left for Chemnitz, Germany, with her mother and daughters, while Vitalii stayed in Ukraine. He had no choice. 
Ukraine had already mobilized its men of fighting age, but fathers of more than two young children were exempt. This baby would be the couple’s third.
After two months of trying, Vitalii was able to leave and join his family in Germany. They then connected with a university professor in Arkansas named Ken Olree, whose church helped a number of Ukrainian families through the U4U program.

At the edge
Like countless other Ukrainians, Evgenia and her family thought their stay in the U.S. would be temporary. 
“I was living the wonderful life in the house of my dreams,” said Evgenia of her life in Ukraine. Three years later, the war shows no signs of stopping, and Russia continues to pummel Ukraine with ever-increasing drone attacks.
The third most populated city in Ukraine, Odesa is a seaside city known for its architectural heritage and its inhabitants’ distinct sense of humor. Its historic downtown is peppered with lush parks, coffee shops with bustling terraces, boutiques and rooftop restaurants with unobstructed views of the Black Sea.
The city’s proximity to Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014, and the magnitude of its port make it a target for Russian airstrikes. While Ukraine’s air attack alert system can successfully warn civilians of an impending air strike in places like Kyiv, drones can cross the distance to Odesa fast enough to leave little to no time for cover.
The port, near the city’s historic center, was where Evgenia and her husband dated, got engaged, and were married soon afterwards. Today, it is closed to the public, partially burned and damaged by strikes.
Evgenia had bathed in the sea’s calm waters during her first pregnancy and later would take leisurely walks by the water on workday lunch breaks. “It felt like the sea was where we drew strength,” she said.
Just months after her family’s emigration, sea mines, both Russian and Ukrainian, forced Odesa to close its coast for some time after a few swimmers died from explosions.

The seashore was also where Evgenia would go on walks with Julia, who works for a maritime employment agency, and where they had partied as single women, dancing at the upscale Ibiza Beach Club. 
Strolling through Odesa’s Lanzheron Beach on a warm Sunday in June, Julia thought back to the time she had spent there with her friend, tears gliding down her cheeks as she recalled when they’d lived mere minutes apart. Life in Odesa had changed so much since that time.
Now the days were punctuated with air alerts signaling potential incoming drones. Even a visit to the mall could turn into a waiting game, as it had for some the day before. Shoppers filed down escalators to the basement-level parking garage, standing among cars as they waited for threats to subside.
A robotic voice announced the all-clear through the mall’s loudspeakers, and shoppers quickly lined back up outside stores, waiting for the security gates to lift. Outside, people resumed evening walks and happy hour chats on restaurant terraces. It was like pressing “play” on a paused movie.
Just hours later, a Russian drone struck a high rise across town. Alarms wailed on and off into the early morning.

But the new day brought renewed energy. Children splashed around in the waves, the water’s green tint a reminder of ecological warfare resulting in algae. Elderly women chatted on lawn chairs, basking in the sun. A man sporting a bandage down his arm pushed a wounded friend through the sand, his leg propped up on his wheelchair. 
The whiplash between the mental toll of Russia’s psychological warfare and residents’ grasp on a ‘normal’ life was palpable.
Russia’s invasion, Julia said, made her “realize that life will never be the same.” By the time she had calmed down that first morning, the military activity made it too risky to leave the city. She decided to stay in Ukraine to be near her parents, even as her friends left the country one by one.
The last time Julia saw Evgenia, in early 2022, she had two cheery toddlers. “I don’t really know when I will feel or touch them, hug them,” Julia said in June. Now, Angelina is 7, Emma is 5, and Olivia, whom Julia never met, is 2. Evgenia is 38.

Resettling
Olree picked up the family in October 2022 and welcomed them into an extra home he owned in Searcy, Ark. The house was furnished, there were clothes for them, and the refrigerator was stocked with food. 
“He’s our angel,” said Evgenia.
She gave birth to their third child, baby Olivia, soon after, and Vitalii began looking for a job. (Under the U4U program, Ukrainians received humanitarian parole, which automatically grants the right to apply for work authorization.)
The main challenge in his job search was the language barrier because his English wasn’t strong. Back in Ukraine, Vitalii had worked for the same food company for 10 years, where he was a regional manager, and had dozens of people reporting to him. In Arkansas, he settled for changing tires.
Believing they would soon return to Ukraine, the family left Arkansas after three months to see more of the country before returning home. For more than a year, they lived in Florida — alternating between a rental home belonging to an acquaintance of Evgenia’s in Delray Beach and a hotel when the rental was occupied. 
They were still hoping for the war to subside so they could return to Odesa. “We see the war getting worse. And I tell my husband we have to stay,” Evgenia said.
 
 

Evgenia cleaned houses to earn an income. 
After a few months, the couple began looking for a home to rent more permanently. But they didn’t have a credit score, among other standard requirements for housing applicants in the U.S.
“I was trying to find something. They said, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no.’” Eventually, one Russian-American couple responded to her husband’s Facebook message on a housing post in Lake Worth, Fla. 
“She says, ‘We don’t need any documents. We want to help you.’ So we got house, we rented it. So the house was very bad, very bad with cockroaches, with mice, rats. Living in a zoo, but it was a house. I was not homeless anymore. At least I was happy.”
The house was a small source of relief from the violence and heartbreak they were following from afar. “I missed home. I was watching all (the) Ukrainian news, every bomb, every house, and they killed a lot of kids. I was crying all the time,” Evgenia said.
To stay afloat, the couple picked up odd jobs, with Evgenia eventually cooking in a daycare and Vitalii working as a handyman. Then one day, a job listing in Evgenia’s Telegram app stood out. It was for a sales manager at a food company in Connecticut.
“I immediately call them and say, I have my husband. He was a top manager in Ukraine. He’s very good in sales. He knows everything. Your company will benefit.”
Vitalii got the job, and the family of five moved to New Haven. It was February 2024, two years after Evgenia fled her homeland.

Stability in New England
In Connecticut, the family began to find their footing. 
They fulfilled their dream of purchasing an RV, which they found discounted on Facebook. That allowed them to make summer road trips to places like Hammonasset State Park and Cape Cod. “This would have been great when we were homeless,” said Evgenia, pointing to the camper parked in their backyard, near a small trampoline for the girls.
Their sun-drenched home in New Haven’s Amity neighborhood echoed with the girls’ joyful squeals as they chased each other. Their drawings, taped to the walls, brought life to the kitchen. Outside, a white picket fence.
Their living room was decorated with hints of their heritage, and a Ukrainian flag hung proudly in the window. Back in Ukraine, Evgenia said, “We didn’t need to think about identity. We just were there.”
Being removed from their homeland pushed Evgenia, Vitalii and their three children to seek out others in the diaspora. 
“We met a lot of Ukrainian people and Ukrainian Americans who were born here,” she said, “but they keep the traditions.” She began studying Ukrainian embroidery and architecture. “I understood that it’s important. I want to know it, and when I know it, I can share it with my kids.”
The eldest, Angelina, now speaks English, but her mother says she struggled through kindergarten and first grade. “I was sad about that, because I feel like she’s stressed all the time.” Her limited grasp on language impacted her confidence. “She didn’t understand English, and it was hard for her,” Evgenia said. “She’s good in math because math, you don’t need English for that.”
Beyond raising three daughters and working as a home aide for the elderly and people with autism, Evgenia took on the role of art director for an event organized by the New Haven Ukrainian American Humanitarian Aid Fund. Tapping into her past experience working at an art gallery, Evgenia named, priced, and categorized the pieces that will be sold at the Wounds to Wonders event on Oct. 26.

The event will take place in St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church, the same church where Angelina recently received her First Communion, and where the family attended events as some of New Haven’s newest community members. 
As the weather warmed up last summer, Evgenia began to take the girls on highly anticipated trips to beaches along the shoreline. On one excursion in mid-August, the girls splashed in Long Island Sound’s gentle waves. Later, they took turns on the swings and shrieked as they played with other children in Lighthouse Point Park’s splash pad in New Haven.
Summer was coming to a close, and so was their chapter in Connecticut.
On Sept. 9, the family made one more move, leaving New Haven for Duncan, South Carolina, where Vitalii took on a new role in his company. 
The plan was for Evgenia to stay back with her daughters for the academic year, as they had gotten off the wait list for their desired schools. But when Evgenia’s car was stolen in front of their home in August, she decided the family should stick together.
“I will always be grateful for Connecticut and for the people there, and I think [Connecticut] is the best,” Evgenia said. “I could get a counselor from CIRI or from IRIS, they’d help me,” she said, referring to two refugee resettlement organizations whose services made her feel supported during her move to Connecticut. Evgenia placed her children in IRIS’ summer program during their first summer in New Haven.

Both CIRI and IRIS have been forced to cut back on the services they offer following funding freezes by the Trump administration, and more recent refugees to Connecticut can no longer access the type of help that was available to Evgenia and her family.
The status of Ukrainians across the U.S. remains in limbo following the pause on the U4U program. And high-profile meetings between President Donald Trump, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin have failed to bring about a solution to the conflict. That has left Ukrainians at home and abroad in a holding pattern. 
Evgenia is taking life day by day, but amid the precarity of her family’s situation, she is certain of one thing: “Connecticut gave us jobs, insurance, school, and community,” she said. “Connecticut saved me.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Not long ago, I was haunting the alleys downtown and noting all the infrastructure you don’t see from the storefronts. The utility poles and power lines and electric meters reminded me of the work of R. Crumb, the underground cartoonist most famous for the anthropomorphic, sexually charged “Fritz the Cat” comics. It wasn’t an oversexed feline I was thinking about but Crumb’s urban drawings, especially “The History of America,” that render in painful detail the things we have trained ourselves not to see, such as the web of power lines strung from utility poles overhead.
One alley in the center of Emporia is packed with such infrastructure, including “One Way” and “Do Not Enter” signs and Dumpsters and pooled rainwater and about a billion feathers from the pigeons that make their homes in the nooks of the surrounding multi-story buildings. I don’t know why, but I find the feathers particularly repulsive. It’s not that there’s a particular problem in my hometown with the birds, not more than any other downtown, or that the alley is filthy or otherwise unclean. The feathers just get to me like some things get to others — like knife on glass or listening to the president trying to pronounce “acetaminophen.”
We all have something that makes us cringe.
I was thinking about these things that drive us individually or collectively to distraction, and it occurred to me the alley was a metaphor for our current political landscape. Behind the marquees of either party, past the storefronts jammed with tired slogans, past the back rooms where the real work is done, either with cigar-smoke influence or cold hard cash, there’s the alley of American political life. This is where the absurd and the unpredictable occur, the place where drunken shouting matches take place, the band smokes reefer and you notice all the hidden things that keep the whole show powered, except it isn’t electricity moving through those lines overhead.
The power that moves through our political high-tension wires is made of money and attention. The money is like volts and the attention is like current. You can’t have one without the other, at least not when there’s flow in the line. There’s nearly an unlimited supply of volts available, thanks to Citizens United, but the amperage is driven by how many eyeballs and ears are on a particular post or podcast or television program.
Right now, an incredible amount of wattage flows through our political infrastructure, enough to make your hair stand on end if you get too close to one of those lines. Say the wrong thing — which in some cases is simply stating a truth — and you might get zapped with a billion watts of blind outrage. Here in Kansas, MAGA toadies have called for the firings of state employees over social media posts. The First Amendment insulation has frayed under the stress to the point where a reasonable citizen might question how much, if any, speech is safe.
We’ve experienced strain on the system before, most recently in the 1960s, and we eventually strengthened the political infrastructure. Some of that super-duty equipment included the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Both were pillars of the modern civil rights movement. The former outlaws discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The latter prohibits racial discrimination in voting, including racial gerrymandering, but it has been gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court through the past 12 years.
We are now in territory that would have been unrecognizable to most Americans just a few years ago. Even though some of us could see it on the horizon, we have arrived in a new country with unexpected urgency, accompanied by political violence. The latest to die, of course, was a 31-year-old MAGA ally, shot Sept. 10 in Utah. Other political assassinations include a former Minnesota speaker of the house, a Democrat, and her husband, in June. These deaths are tragic. I will not attempt to describe the political beliefs of either Charlie Kirk or Melissa Hortman. No postmortem commentary should add or detract a whit of what they had to say in life.
When bullets silence speech, democracy is in grave peril. It was already in trouble, considering the rush to authoritarianism and the repeated stumbles of Democrats, but on this month an American tradition was made new again. Political violence is a habit we must break, or it will surely break us.
My earliest media memories are television coverage of assassinations in the 1960s. I felt the fear radiating from my parents and other adults as television beamed into our living rooms news of the assassinations of a president, a civil rights leader, and a presidential nominee. John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy. There were more. The killing of revolutionary Black separatist Malcolm X, the attempted assassination of presidential hopeful and white segregationist George Wallace, the executions of Mississippi Freedom Riders Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
We are at another turning point in American history at which we must ask: What now? How much more can we endure? Where is the country we once knew?
No matter our discomfort, we must not surrender to whatever heated inclination to mayhem may surge through us. No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, a violent response would power more violence. There’s been a lot of talk in the wake of the shooting earlier this month that political violence is never the answer. That, of course, is the only proper reaction. What also needs to be said is that retaliation for political violence is not the answer, either.
While the manhunt was still ongoing for the Kirk shooter, the president was quick to blame political enemies for the shooting. He declared Kirk a martyr and promised a national crackdown on political violence, including nonprofits and others he accuses of funding organizations that support it. Since that declaration, Trump suggested some broadcasters should have their licenses revoked for engaging in speech critical of his administration.
A TV talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel, was suspended by Disney-owned ABC for his remarks on the Kirk killing. The Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, had said Kimmel should be suspended and “we could do it the easy way or the hard way.” The threat of regulatory action was clear. Kimmel has since been reinstated by ABC to a surge in ratings, although the program was still boycotted by the Nexstar and Sinclair station groups, effectively removing Kimmel from about 20% of markets. In his returning monologue, Kimmel called the censorship threat by the FCC chair “un-American” while tearfully mourning the loss of Kirk as someone whose life was cut short.
Freedom of speech is among the foundational principles of the American experiment in democracy. It goes all the way back to before we were a nation, to when colonial printer John Peter Zenger’s newspapers were burned by the governor of New York in 1734. But the Kimmel case may be the most high-profile modern example since police raided a small-town newspaper two years ago — here in Kansas.
The Kimmel firing also appears to be a textbook case of censorship, when a government official (in this case, the president and his FCC chair) attempt to suppress speech based on content. This is prohibited by the First Amendment. From the president all the way down to your town council and school officials, the law is meant to restrain government actors from trampling your expression.
But as troubling as the government suppression of speech is, there’s a related stifling of expression we must now talk about. It’s self-censorship. If you’ve caught yourself thinking twice before sharing your political views with others, you’re suffering the chilling effect of political violence and the government’s retaliatory crackdown on dissent. You may not be suffering immediate effects, such as the loss of a job, but there is a cumulative risk, like secondhand smoke.
Back when I was a student journalist, I once had a piece of mine challenged at the last minute because a school official thought it was obscene. In those days I briefly drew a comic strip for the campus newspaper at a public university in Kansas. I was heavily influenced by Doonesbury and other, less mainstream comics, and it was the second or third installment of the strip. It involved somebody asking where the nearest bathroom was on campus and a communication major being unable to answer the question clearly. By the end of the strip, the character doing the asking was turning into a kind of human pretzel to keep it all in.
Not great stuff. Did I mention I was still a teenager?
But when the newspaper sent the pages to the printer on campus, a question arose. Somebody thought the strip was obscene. They imagined they saw an exposed private part in the drawing. A dean was alerted and I was summoned to the print shop. I never did see what the shop supervisor thought he saw. But I remember how uncomfortable it was to stand in a group of older adults — of authority figures — and try to explain there was no penis in the cartoon.
It didn’t matter, they said, they weren’t running it unless I changed it.
I was handed a grease pencil.
I didn’t know enough then to understand that even if I had drawn something a bit naughty, it wasn’t enough to qualify as obscene. If it had been obscene — and that is quite a high bar — it wouldn’t have been protected by the First Amendment. But it wasn’t that, it was just a sketch, a silly attempt by an aspiring cartoonist. I yielded to the pressure and used the grease pencil to change the offending part of the drawing on the page composite. The bowdlerization was completed using some black tape and an X-Acto knife.
I recall how I flushed with embarrassment.
Had I been in the campus newsroom, I might have had the courage to refuse. But I was across campus in the print shop, with angry authority figures telling me they couldn’t run my strip because it was improper. Afterward, I kept the incident to myself.
I was ashamed and desperately wished I’d never tried drawing a comic strip. I vowed never to do it again for publication, and I didn’t. I abandoned drawing comics forever as soon as I put the grease pencil down.
I censored myself.
It may have been one of the reasons I so desperately fought for the rights of my journalism students when I became a college publications adviser decades later. That old cartoon strip was something I’d tried to push out of my mind. I didn’t think I was angry about the incident at the time, just ashamed. Did I have any promise as a cartoonist? Probably not. But the next Art Spiegelman or Alison Bechdel may be thinking twice about putting thought to paper or pixels because of the Trump era attacks on free speech.
There is only one Kimmel, and his suspension and reinstatement has dominated the news. We are right to be concerned about the future of free expression in America, for journalists and cartoonists and late-night talk show hosts. But we should also be concerned about the chilling effect all of this has on the rest of us.
The most effective tool to silence dissent is not force, but shame.
If your views don’t match that of the current administration or its favored political movement, you may have had an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. I know I’ve had. You might think your views might be offensive to some of your friends and neighbors. I know mine are. Your cheeks might sometimes become flushed when trying to explain yourself. I’ve been there too.
But the thing is that disagreeing with somebody isn’t the same as wishing them harm. Neither is refusing to act with what government officials and influential others may regard as the proper deference. If they take offense at your rational and nonviolent opinion, the fault is theirs and not yours.
You may not think your opinion counts for much, that you don’t have anything to add, or that engaging in the sober debate over the deep issues that divide us is important. You might even feel that saying what you feel is right might be disrespectful. Or you might just want to tell a joke a draw a comic with a political bent. But it is all the kind of free and unfettered exchange a functioning democracy requires.
We’ve all felt so much political cringe and stepped-up outrage that our collective hair is standing on end.
But don’t let a bullet fired in Utah make you silence yourself. Speak out against political violence, always. But don’t allow others to make you so afraid of retribution, so deferential to power and authority, or so ashamed of your own beliefs that you stifle yourself.
In other words, Keep on Truckin’.

But here are a few tips for making your next ride frictionless.  These tips are mostly about riding Acela, but many hold true for slower Northeast Corridor trains.


What’s a NextGen Acela? These are the new trains built by Alstom, previously known as Avelia Liberty.  They hold 25% more passengers than the existing Acela trains and can, at least for 32 miles with fast, straight track in New Jersey, travel up to 160 mph compared to the old Acela’s 150 mph.
Just a few of the new trains are running so far but 26 are more on the way, replacing the older Acelas which will be retired.
Book early:  We booked our Acela tickets about two weeks in advance and scored senior fares (10% discount) of “only” $204 one way from Stamford to Washington D.C.  Waiting at the station to board I heard the ticket agent startle a younger passenger seeking a ticket to DC by quoting her the same-day walk-up fare of $402 one way.  A minute later the helpful agent said she could make the same trip a half-hour later (on the slower train) for half as much.
Reserved seats: Seats on all Acelas are now reserved.  But don’t trust the seating chart you’ll see online.  When we boarded the train we found our seats faced backwards (not in the direction of travel) and had no window.  But a helpful conductor found us better seats right on his phone.  Consult a third-party seating chart to make sure you get the seats you want.
If you want the Quiet Car, be aware there’s only one such car with 59 seats.  Otherwise you’ll be enjoying the “finance bro” across the aisle making deals enroute by phone.
Boarding advice: The cars on the NextGen Acela are much shorter than the regular trains, so position yourself carefully on the platform to minimize walking once the train arrives.  I noticed Amtrak staff at each station helping minimize “dwell time” for the train by getting passengers off and on as quickly as possible.
Use the Red Caps: If your train originates at your station, like our return from DC, get priority pre-boarding with the help of the Red Caps.  Avoiding the throngs queueing to board is worth a tip, even with reserved seats.
How’s the ride? In a word, spectacular.  All the Acelas run no faster than Metro-North in Connecticut, but south of New York City it’s a whole different railroad.  True to its promise our train hit 159 mph on the straightaways in New Jersey and the ride overall was very smooth, unlike the 25-year-old Amfleet cars or the 50-year-old Amfleet cars on the slower trains.
Service: Enroute the cabin cleaning staff came around to collect trash and Café Car items were available (credit cards only) from a cart moving between the cars.  The Café Car itself looked great with self-serve windows displaying the food items. But there are no tables to sit down, just some counters where you can perch and munch.  The food offerings were “premium” and priced accordingly.

The on-board Wi-Fi was spectacular… truly 5G.
On time? Like many Amtrak trains, even the super-Acela tends to run a few minutes late in Connecticut because of Metro-North traffic.  We departed about ten minutes late from Stamford but, because the schedule is padded, were on time out of Penn Station and arrived early in Washington D.C.
Is it worth trying?  Yes, at least once.  Amtrak has a lot riding on these new trainsets, so try one soon and you’ll see what the future will be like.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acela-Engineer-runwaygirlnetwork-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-28 04:57:22.305214

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Democratic presidential nominating process may not begin in Iowa during future presidential nominating cycles, but politician Rahm Emanuel told a crowd of 400 Iowans Saturday the state will play an important role for Democrats in 2026 and beyond.
“I want you guys to have some confidence,” Emanuel said. “People bet on winners, and Iowa is where winners are made.”
Emanuel, who has served as former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, a U.S. representative, former mayor of Chicago and U.S. ambassador to Japan, spoke at a fish-fry fundraiser for Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines. The longtime Democratic operative has not officially said whether he plans to run for president in the next election cycle — although he has made several comments indicating he is considering a run — and he did not bring up the future role of the Iowa Democratic caucuses in 2028 or beyond.
However, Emanuel did speak about his vision for national policies while answering questions on issues such as President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, Medicaid and education. Emanuel said he has spent more than 30 years trying to “unrig a system that is rigged” while working on issues such as gun regulation and health care access.
“I’m here to tell you, in confession, I’m done unrigging it – I’m going to rig it for the people that work hard and play by the rules,” Emanuel said.
Iowa lost its first-in-the-nation status beginning with the Democratic presidential nominating cycle in 2024 due to concerns with the reporting of results from the 2020 Democratic caucuses and Iowa’s use of the caucus process rather than primaries. While the Democratic National Committee is reconsidering its presidential nominating calendar for 2028, it currently seems unlikely that Iowa will regain its position.
This has not stopped Democrats like Emanuel, as well as other potential presidential hopefuls like U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg from visiting the state in 2025.
On Saturday, Emanuel also said he believes Democratic candidates are in a good position heading into the 2026 midterms, highlighting the state’s gubernatorial, U.S. Senate and state auditor races, as well as congressional races. Emanuel joked that “I don’t want to put on my old Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hat, but I see two (competitive seats) … Okay, I’m not going to tell you which two, but I see it” — likely referring to Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts, which have been rated by political forecasters as potential flips for Democrats.
He also brought up the victory of Iowa Sen. Catelin Drey, D-Sioux City, who won with 55% of the vote in an August special election against her Republican opponent Christopher Prosch for a seat formerly held by Republican Sen. Rocky De Witt of Lawton.
“I want the rest of America to know what Iowa’s doing, not the other way around,” Emanuel said. “You guys are leading the way. So, congratulations.”
Drey also spoke at the event, calling for Iowans who are upset with the GOP-led state and federal government to speak out, run for public office, and support Democratic candidates.
“Together we can do extraordinary things, but not if we are focused on playing nice and following the rules and waiting our turn,” Drey said. “So, this is our turn, and I would like for us to take it together.”
Bagniewski begins event with acknowledgement of DMPS superintendent arrest

Bagniewski began the event by making a statement about the detainment Friday of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Ian Roberts. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said Roberts entered the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa and was not authorized to work in the country, in addition to being charged with illegally possessing weapons in 2020.
The DMPS school board placed Roberts on administrative leave during a special meeting Saturday. DMPS officials held a news conference Friday speaking about the incident, though they did not comment on the validity of DHS claims.
At the fundraising event, Bagniewski said his thoughts and prayers are with Roberts right now, as well as with teachers, parents and students across Des Moines. Bagniewski said after his son, Teddy, came home from school yesterday, he had a “hard conversation” about what occurred.
“Our community is grieving right now, and I hope we get to a better place on the other side of all this,” Bagniewski said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a statement earlier Saturday on the arrest where she spoke in support of enforcing immigration laws.
“The arrest on Friday of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts was shocking, particularly his attempt to evade authorities, and the loaded gun, knife, and large sum of cash found in his vehicle,” Reynolds said in the statement. “The investigation is still underway, so I won’t comment on details of the case at this time. But I want to be clear: We are a nation of laws that must be enforced. Those who believe immigration laws are optional are dangerously wrong. When laws are ignored, or when people are led to believe there will be no consequences, our communities are at risk. Iowans won’t stand for that. We must enforce the law, every time, to protect our families and our future.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/emanuel.9.27.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-27 22:57:01.718909

(Undated photo courtesy of Arkansas Department of Corrections)After pushback from members of her own party, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders late Friday changed the date of the general election to fill the vacant District 26 Senate seat from November 2026 to June.
The new general election date still comes after the end of the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session, giving rise to complaints from Republicans and Democrats that citizens of the district will be unrepresented in next springs legislative fiscal session
Republican candidate Ted Tritt of Paris posted on Facebook Saturday: “Any step to shorten the time our people go unrepresented is encouraging,” but the new date remains “unacceptable.”
Tritt is one of three Republicans who have announced their intent to run; the others are Brad Simon, also of Paris, and former state Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
The special election is being called to replace Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died Sept. 2. 
State law requires a special election be held not more than 150 days after a legislative seat becomes vacant, unless the governor determines it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
Tritt, Simon and Arkansas Democratic Party Chair, retired Army Col. Marcus Jones all criticized the election dates as unfair to residents of the district, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
Stubblefield was a vocal opponent of a proposed 3,000-bed state prison in rural Franklin County supported by Sanders, and Simon and Tritt expressed concerns Friday that the area’s residents will be left without representation during likely discussions of prison funding in the fiscal session.

In her original and updated proclamations Friday, Sanders declared that holding the election within the 150-day window would be impractical and burdensome.
She originally set the special primary for the District 26 seat for March 3 and the general election for Nov. 3, 2026, dates which coincide with the state’s regular election schedule.
The revised election schedule kept the primary election on March 3, but moved the general election to June 9.
In a press release announcing the revised election dates, Sanders said that “after receiving feedback from the community and getting confirmation from election officials that a change while difficult is doable, I have decided to move up the general election date to expedite representation for the River Valley.”
Arkansas Democrats, in a Saturday press release, said Sanders is still “ignoring the law.”
“This is nothing but a bandaid to the serious bipartisan backlash she’s receiving, but she is still openly and scandalously defying Arkansas law,” Jones said in the release. “The Governor has a legal responsibility to fill this vacancy within 150 days, and the updated election date is still 130 days after that deadline.” 
“This general election date still leaves more than 85,000 Arkansans without representation in the Senate for 280 days: not only does that take away their say in the 2026 budget, but that means there is no one to reach out to when they need resources or assistance from Arkansas’s highest legislative body,” Jones said.
Tritt wrote on Facebook that “the reality remains: District 26 will still go through the spring fiscal session without a senator and clock over 250 days without representation. That’s well beyond what the law calls for, and far beyond what our families deserve.”
“Budgets will be written. Priorities will be set. Votes on the Franklin County prison project will be taken. Decisions will be made that affect our schools, our hospitals, our farms, and our jobs. And through all of it, the people of District 26 will not have a seat at the table,” he said.
Simon posted on Facebook Friday that letting the seat remain vacant for so long is “unconscionable, unacceptable, and unconstitutional.”

Eastern State Hospital is one of two state-run psychiatric hospitals for adults in Washington and is located in Medical Lake, Washington, west of Spokane.
“Preliminary information indicates that this armed suspect is believed to have been acting erratically in Medical Lake and possibly involved in three incidents that occurred in the same general time frame,” the sheriff’s office said.
These reports described a man making “wild statements,” including about aliens.
Firefighters responded to a brush fire around midnight and encountered a man yelling and acting aggressively. They requested police assistance, but the sheriff’s office said the man left the scene before deputies arrived.
Around 1:40 a.m., police received a call about a man with a rifle who entered a home and fired several shots as uninjured occupants hid.
About 15 minutes later, a caller reported the Eastern State Hospital employee had been shot in the hospital’s parking lot. The suspect took the employee’s radio and began transmitting messages over it about “an army coming,” police said.
“We grieve the tragic loss of life of an Eastern State Hospital employee who was murdered by an active shooter overnight at work,” Washington Federation of State Employees President Mike Yestramski said in a statement. “Senseless acts of violence like this have become an all too common reality these days.”
The Department of Social and Health Services, which runs the hospital, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday morning.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EasternStateHospitalWA-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-27 16:57:29.103234

Tim Walz call a special legislative session to consider a ban on assault weapons.
The rally came more than a month after two children were killed and 21 other people injured, all of them children and senior citizens.
Brittany Haeg, whose six-year-old son David was injured in the shooting, urged lawmakers to act quickly and decisively. “I’m here to tell you as a Catholic, as a mother, as a human: prayers in place of action when you have the power to act are a betrayal of prayer itself.”

She described her experience testifying before a state Senate gun control working group, where she told lawmakers about her son’s injuries, “about the bullets that lacerated his spleen, about the shrapnel still scattered through his side, about the bullets that grazed his skull. Then I listened to other parents, to the doctors who saved David, to their anguish and their grief, to their fear.”
She then called out Republican Sen. Jeff How of Rockville.
“And then I listened to Sen. Howe tell me he couldn’t support a ban on assault rifles, or high capacity magazines,” she said, “because shooting guns with a 30-round magazine, like the one that nearly killed my son, is fun. Fun, he told us.”
Boos and hisses erupted from the crowd.
“Listen closely,” Haeg said, “Your silence is not neutral. Your silence is a choice.”

Republicans say an assault weapons ban is a violation of 2nd Amendment gun rights and won’t stop motivated killers from acquiring weapons.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter spoke about the bittersweet feeling of dropping his children off for their first day of school, saying that his wife made note of where his daughter’s seat was in relationship to the windows and doors. “We are being robbed of our peace,” he said.
Tess Rada, whose 8-year-old daughter survived the shooting, spoke about the trauma of hearing the 116 shots inside of the church where her daughter prayed.
She read the names of children killed in recent school shootings in the United States, ending with Harper Moyski, 10, and Fletcher Merkel, 8. It took more than a minute to read the whole list.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)County election officials are required to accurately report when  voters’ mail-in ballots have been set aside because of disqualifying errors and allow their votes to be counted on provisional ballots, Pennsylvania’s highest court ruled.
The state Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision Friday upholds lower court rulings that Washington County election officials violated voters’ rights by misleading them about the status of their mail-in ballots. 
This prevented voters from challenging the board’s decision to disqualify 259 vote-by-mail ballots or casting provisional ballots as a backup to ensure their votes were counted, the courts said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We must interpret the Election Code and its statutory procedures in a way that ‘favors the fundamental right to vote and enfranchises, rather than disenfranchises, the electorate,’” Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote for the majority, quoting the court’s 2020 decision resolving issues surrounding the then-new vote-by-mail law. 
“Reading the Code as allowing county boards to withhold readily available information from voters does not serve that goal,” Dougherty wrote.
Mimi McKenzie, legal director of the Public Interest Law Center, which represented voters and voting rights advocates in the case, said the right to vote is fundamental and the foundation of the nation’s democracy.
“Yesterday’s decision is a win for voters. Boards of Election cannot segregate mail-in ballots with disqualifying envelope errors and then withhold that information. Voters should be afforded an opportunity to cast a provisional ballot if they make a paperwork mistake on their mail-in ballot envelope,” she said.  
The Republican Party of Pennsylvania, which filed the appeal along with the Republican National Committee, and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party did not respond to the Capital-Star’s requests for comment.
The decision stems from a decision by the Washington County Board of Elections days before the 2024 primary to rescind a policy of notifying voters about disqualifying errors on their ballot declarations such as missing signatures or dates. 
The policy allowed voters to correct errors, request a fresh mail-in ballot or vote provisionally at their polling places on Election Day.

Instead, elections office workers were instructed to stamp ballots with the date and time they were received and make a decision whether to set aside ballots with obvious disqualifying errors such as a missing signature or date. All ballots were also scanned into the state’s electronic voting system and recorded as “ballot received,” regardless of whether they were segregated for errors.
This prompted the system to automatically generate an email stating that the ballot had been received, and that if the “election office identifies an issue with your ballot envelopes that prevents the ballot from being counted, you may receive another notification.” Otherwise, the email stated, voters would not receive any further messages and would not be able to vote at their polling locations on Election Day.
It also caused the poll books at voting locations to indicate that a voter had cast a mail ballot, preventing those whose ballots were set aside from casting provisional ballots.
A group of seven disenfranchised voters backed by the Center for Coalfield Justice and the Washington Branch NAACP filed a challenge in July 2024, claiming the board’s new policy violated voters’ constitutional rights to due process of law. A Washington County judge ruled in their favor and a 2-1 Commonwealth Court panel affirmed the decision on appeal.
In his opinion for the Supreme Court majority, Dougherty said the RNC and Pennsylvania Republican Party’s arguments that the board of elections should be allowed to “hide the readily ascertainable status of electors’ mail-in ballots” would punish voters for common errors. He added that their positions are at odds with both the Election Code and the commonwealth’s longstanding practice and policy of protecting the right to vote.
While the courts have affirmed that the Election Code does not provide for voters to “cure” defective ballots, Dougherty scolded the Republican Party for characterizing voters who make minor mistakes as “noncompliant” and “fingerwagging” that the legislature has “forbidden do-overs.”
“But this case is not about do-overs. It is not about correcting a defective mail-in ballot return packet. It is not about a “second bite” at the proverbial apple, and it is not about double-voting,” Dougherty wrote. 
“It is about allowing a voter who made a mistake on a mail-in ballot return packet — the kind of mistake that will likely disqualify the ballot and invalidate the elector’s attempt to vote — to avail herself of the remaining “fail-safe” attempt to exercise her fundamental right: completing a provisional ballot on Election Day,” he wrote.

Dougherty added that in that case, the state voting system is designed to ensure that only the provisional ballot would be counted, or if the mail-in ballot is counted, then the provisional ballot is thrown away.
“In both scenarios, however, the only way the elector gets her single vote counted is to be given the easily accessible information that was intentionally withheld in this case,” he said.
Justice Kevin Brobson issued a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice David Wecht, in which he cited a fundamental disagreement with the majority on whether a mail-in ballot with missing signatures or dates is actually void and whether provisional voting is allowed. He also expressed concerns about a lack of consistency across the state in whether voters should be allowed to correct such errors. 
“Like existing county-by-county “notice and cure” practices, the Majority’s decision here provides another data point upon which electors can reasonably question whether our elections meet the promise of equality and uniformity guaranteed by our state charter,” Brobson said.
Justice Sallie Mundy issued a separate dissenting opinion in which she added her concerns about the fairness of the state electronic election system notifying voters their mail ballots are disqualified because providing an email is optional when registering to vote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7447-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-27 11:57:27.993073

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Current reporter Alexander Castro won a first place A-Mark Prize at the New England Newspaper & Press Association (NENPA) fall publishers conference for his reporting on the RIBridges data breach. 
The prize for investigative journalism came with $5,000 cash for Castro and an additional $2,500 for Rhode Island Current. Funding comes from the A-Mark Foundation.
The awards ceremony occurred on the second day of the NENPA conference at The Hotel Northampton in Northampton, Massachusetts. This year’s conference was jointly hosted by the New York Press Association, and A-Mark Prizes were given to three reporters in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. There were not enough entries for A-Mark Prizes from Maine and New Hampshire news outlets, according to the event program, although NENPA hopes to award A-Marks in these states next year. 
“The Prize will reward ambitious, well-researched reporting that may expose a wrong, hold powerful individuals accountable, or explore a complex problem, issue, or subject,” the prize application read. The judging panel for each state consisted of journalists, editors, journalism educators, and investigative reporters. 
Castro’s winning entry on the RIBridges data breach spanned reportage published from December to May, when the state’s public benefits systems was hacked and the data leaked online. Around 650,000 residents were affected, according to state officials. After the initial wave of reporting on the breach had subsided, Rhode Island Current coverage revealed that a state request for proposals posted months before the hack contained a system architecture diagram — a blueprint for possible intrusion. Castro notified officials and Rhode Island Current delayed publication until after the documents were taken down. 
Providence Journal writers Mark Reynolds and Jack Perry placed second and third, respectively, in Rhode Island’s batch of A-Mark prizes. 
Rhode Island Current content partner Connecticut Mirror won first and third place A-Mark prizes in its state.
At last year’s fall publishers conference in Providence, NENPA named Rhode Island Current the region’s Online News Publication of the Year. That competition was judged by New England readers. NENPA announced there is no Online News Publication award for 2025 because judges did not receive enough entries to consider.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed Gov. Larry Rhoden’s bill designed to help homeowners get relief from the high cost of paying property taxes. Don’t expect that to be the last word on the subject.
Dramatic increases in property taxes have given rise to some strident calls for change. Owner-occupied dwellings, in particular, have seen their property tax bills increase. While the Legislature is certainly listening to those complaints, as yet it is still struggling to find relief for property owners who say they are seeing the ability to keep living in their homes slipping away.
The property tax problems in South Dakota were neatly summed up during an educational panel at Dakotafest, as noted in a story in the Mitchell Republic. South Dakota Retailers Executive Director Nathan Sanderson said that when the subject is property tax relief, the state has three choices: shift the burden to another class of property, ask schools and counties to spend less, or find another funding source.
None of those solutions have many backers, though finding another funding source is part of the solution offered by Rhoden. He has proposed allowing counties to voluntarily impose a sales tax of up to half a percent with the funds to be used for relief of residential property taxes. This is a stopgap measure at best and sure to have its detractors in the Republican-controlled Legislature, because it calls for a new tax.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

Rhoden already has one property tax win, with the passage of a complex law designed to offer homeowners some relief. The new law, which took effect July 1, limits the increase in owner-occupied residential assessments to 3% countywide for five years; sets a five-year, 3% cap on the amount taxing districts and school capital outlay budgets can increase as a result of new construction; exempts some home improvements worth less than 40% of a home’s value from affecting assessments; and expands eligibility among disabled and elderly people for property tax assessment freeze programs, including an increase in the multi-person household income limit from $45,000 to $65,000, and an increase in the maximum value of an eligible home from $300,000 to $500,000.
While that legislation has many moving parts, it represents only a portion of a tax system that lawmakers were admonished to study by another Dakotafest panel member. Former state senator Mary Duvall said lawmakers should do their homework, learning about the state’s tax system so they know what they’re talking about and have the expertise to assess the impact of their legislation.
The need for expertise in how the system works can be seen in a proposed constitutional amendment offered by former legislator Julie Frye-Mueller, among others. That amendment has not yet been approved for circulation to gather signatures.
If approved by voters, the amendment would scrap property taxes and instead levy a $1.50 fee on transactions of $15 or more and a 10% fee on purchases of less than $15. These fees would be charged over and above the sales taxes that are already on the books.
The Legislative Research Council, which has to review all proposed constitutional amendments, said its passage would change everything as it relates to the funding of counties and schools. Passage of the amendment would also rely on the Legislature to design a way to collect the tax, establish a distribution formula and manage a new property tax replacement fund.
Those blank spots in the amendment will certainly ask voters to take plenty on faith if they were to vote for the new system. The next step in the process of approving the amendment for circulation is creating a fiscal impact statement which will show if the new tax, at a buck-and-a-half a purchase, could actually generate enough money to keep schools and counties afloat.
The proposed amendment shows the folly of trying to fix the state’s tax system in a piecemeal fashion. Like the 18 property tax bills in the 2025 legislative session or the dozens that will likely show up in 2026, they only go to show that there’s no one solution to revamping the system.
As Sanderson pointed out at Dakotafest, the Legislature has been “schizophrenic” lately when it comes to taxes, cutting the sales tax and considering elimination of the sales tax on groceries. Lawmakers do this, all the while proposing legislation that’s supposed to “fix” property taxes, often without including a way to replace the funding.
According to Sanderson, the Legislature has conducted summer studies of property taxes three times in the last five years. With summer winding down, let’s hope that this year’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force can decide on a way forward that makes sense for the state.
That may be a lot to hope for since past summer studies apparently haven’t alleviated the pressure felt by the state’s property taxpayers. The scope of these studies is too narrow. It would be best for the state to widen the study and take on all taxes, rather than just property taxes. A comprehensive study is needed because it’s obvious that a change in property taxes is likely to have ramifications for the state’s entire tax system.

Alex Padilla visits San Diego immigration court: ‘This should not be a trap’,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/alex-padilla-visits-san-diego-immigration-court/,Sen. Alex Padilla observed immigration court in San Diego this week in order to get a better understand of the issues that people face in proceedings.,"In summary
Sen. Alex Padilla observed immigration court in San Diego this week in order to get a better understand of the issues that people face in proceedings. 


When Sen. Alex Padilla attended an immigration hearing at the federal courthouse in San Diego Wednesday, there were no confrontations with federal officials and no public arrests of people attending immigration check-ins. 
Instead, the visit revealed the confusion involved in legal proceedings conducted in multiple languages, over virtual platforms, amid a federal campaign of mass deportations.
Padilla, a member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Security, said he wanted to observe the issues that people face in immigration proceedings.
“In that capacity as part of our oversight responsibilities in the Senate I came to see firsthand what we’ve been hearing for months and months now,” he said at a press conference after the visit. “Not just the stops, the detentions, the arrests on the streets through this immigration enforcement activity by this administration, but even people who have been in the system coming in from periodic check-ins, trying to comply with the conditions of their status.”
In May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 11 people after their hearings at San Diego Immigration Court and placed them in a process called expedited removal, as part of a nationwide effort to fast track deportations.
This month, a San Diego law firm challenged courthouse arrests in a lawsuit filed on behalf of two asylum seekers. The complaint argues that those arrests are unconstitutional and erode the integrity of the asylum process.
There were no such detentions on Wednesday, but Padilla said he wanted to make sure no one was arrested while complying with the immigration process.
“Whether people are quote unquote ‘playing by the rules,’ they should not be penalized for them,” he said. “This should not be a trap.” 
Padilla made headlines in June after he entered a Los Angeles press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and was tackled by her security officers and forcibly removed. 
Noem said he barged into the room and interrupted the event, but Padilla said he attended peacefully and properly identified himself. Videos of the incident illustrate the tension between President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration raids and California officials’ efforts to oversee enforcement action within the state.
On Wednesday, Padilla highlighted his low-key appearance at the San Diego court hearing.
“I sat quietly in the back,” he said. “I want to make sure I emphasize that, because I was not disrupting, not recording, was not interfering with the procedures, and saw multiple people who were scheduled to be before judges today in person. The judge was not in person. The judge was remote.”
While the judge’s appearance over video is legal, Padilla said, it can limit their ability to observe and communicate with defendants.
“When a judge is not present in person to be able to read body language, and is remote and virtual, that also is not ideal,” Padilla said, adding that immigration courts need more judges to handle the volume of cases generated through increased ICE enforcement.

The first defendant Wednesday was a young Haitian man. Although the Wednesday hearing was simply an intake procedure that did not cover the substance of his immigration status or case, it included multiple miscommunications.
Judge Olga Attia appeared on screen, introduced herself and learned that he needed a Creole interpreter. The interpreter also logged in remotely, but poor audio quality made it hard to follow the discussion.
Attia learned that the defendant had recently moved, so she ordered a recess while he completed a change of address form. 
While he filled that out, she called the second defendant, who confirmed that he spoke English and Bengali, but did not need an interpreter and did not have legal representation. It turned out that he too had recently changed his address and needed to fill out the form.
Shifting back to the Haitian man, Attia tried to establish the basic details of his residence, educational status and guardianship. But the attorney representing him said the client had been “unresponsive and uncooperative” and had not returned calls. Because of that, he and his co-counsel asked to withdraw from the case. The defendant said his phone wasn’t working, so he couldn’t receive his attorneys’ calls or messages.
“I guess if I share a couple of takeaways it’s in some ways the inefficiency of the process, whether it’s the need for additional access to counsel in person, or whether it’s the need for translation services,” Padilla said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425_Padilla-SD-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-27 10:59:00.898233

By Ryan Colasanti
WILMINGTON — Sussex Central lined up in punt formation on their own side of the field trailing Salesianum by ten early in the third quarter. The Golden Knights appeared ready to punt the ball away after their first drive of the second half was halted by the Sallies defense. Instead, the snap went directly into the hands of senior William Harmon, shocking the Salesianum special teams unit.
Harmon flew down the right side of the field all the way to the Salesianum 24 yard line before he was taken down by a few Sallies defenders. The fake punt paid off a few plays later when senior quarterback Josiah Cannon connected with Harmon down the right sideline for a 20-yard score to draw within three points. That’s the closest the score would be the rest of the night.
Sallies scored 21 unanswered points following the Golden Knights’ successful third quarter drive defeating Sussex Central, 31-7, Friday night at Abessinio Stadium.
Sallies’ defense was strong throughout the evening holding a powerful Golden Knight offense under 30 points for the first time this season. Sallies was able to slow down Sussex Central’s mighty running game and force a couple of turnovers to earn their first regular season victory over Sussex Central since 2021.
One of those turnovers was a pick six from junior Jett Healy that he ran back 28-yards for his second of two touchdowns in the game. Healy’s pick six occurred with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter capping off a streak of three straight drives ending with Salaesianum points.
Healy’s first touchdown of the game started the scoring streak.
Following the Golden Knights score at the start of the third quarter, Sallies began their drive at their own 38 yard line. Salesianum marched down the field all the way to the Sussex two yard line where Healy took a wildcat snap into the endzone to restore Sallies’ lead to ten.
EstherVell Cotton followed Healy on Sallies next offensive possession, running outside the right tackle for a 23-yard score in the fourth quarter. Senior Devin Hasan was the only other Sallies player to record a touchdown catching a nine yard throw from quarterback Brady Nabb on Salesianum’s first possession of the game.
Sallies’ win boosts their record to .500 after a couple tough losses to two out-of-state powerhouses in LaSalle College High School and Malvern Prep High School. Sallies is undefeated this season when playing in state competition, beginning the year with a win over Red Lion.
Sussex Central’s loss is its second in as many games. The Golden Knights started the year with two straight victories over West Philadelphia High School in Pennsylvania and Woodbridge, but lost to Hodgson a week ago.

Watching the space between two nations shrink became a regular pastime for Detroiters over the past decade as the segments of the Gordie Howe International Bridge gradually grew, extending meter by meter from Ontario on one side and Michigan on the other.
The gap finally closed in July 2024 with the two halves coming together in a long-awaited kiss.
The official grand opening of the bridge was originally scheduled for fall of 2025, but it seems now likely to be delayed into 2026.
I’m a sociologist who has worked alongside neighborhood revitalization projects in Detroit for the past 15 years. I’ve observed the bridge project – and the many tensions around it – from the perspective of adjacent communities of Delray and Mexicantown, communities that are largely home to low-income Latino, Black and white residents.
The costs and benefits of this binational behemoth are complex and intertwined.
 Clearing a chokehold

Boosters on both sides of the border have spoken frequently of the bridge’s expected benefits.
Detroit and Windsor would finally be free of the perpetual chokehold produced by the privately owned Ambassador Bridge.
Auto parts will flow more freely over the border, according to the Cross-Border Institute at the University of Windsor. And the Detroit Greenways Coalition is celebrating that its advocacy led to the inclusion of free pedestrian and bike lanes.
People living close to the existing bridge will gain some relief from truck traffic and pollution. But this burden won’t simply disappear – it will be shifted nearby, where others will have to cope with increased traffic flowing over six lanes 24 hours a day.

 A political football

The costs and benefits of the bridge were contested from the beginning.
In the early days, the debate concentrated on who would own the bridge and who would pay for it.
Once just a concept known by the acronym DRIC, or Detroit River International Crossing, the project became real under former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. In July 2018, representatives from both Ottawa and Washington broke ground on the bridge situated in an area of Detroit empty enough to contain its significant footprint and bear its weight without fear of sinkholes from underground salt mines.
“Every Michigander should thank every Canadian,” said Snyder at the time, alluding to the agreement that Canadian taxpayers alone would pay for the bridge’s construction in exchange for collecting all the tolls.
The bridge’s designers attempted to honor the cultural and natural history of the region. It was named after the legendary Canadian hockey player who was also a longtime stalwart for the Detroit Red Wings. The bridge’s towers are adorned with murals by First Nations artists.
But serious questions remain.
Today the debates center on whether the Trump administration’s increased tariffs and trade conflicts with Canada could negatively affect the value of the bridge – and if it will ever pay for itself. Even before President Donald Trump took office for the second time, truck traffic on the Ambassador Bridge was down, falling 8% from 2014 to 2024.

 One bridge was always a bad idea, (nearly) everyone agreed

Residents and politicians have long agreed that having a single, privately owned bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor was a bad idea. This felt especially apparent after the 9/11 terrorist attacks laid bare the possibility of suddenly losing critical infrastructure.
For many years, travelers’ only other connection between Canada and Detroit has been a tunnel that runs underneath the Detroit River. However, the tunnel doesn’t offer direct access to interstate highways, making it less suitable for commercial trucks.
Adding another bridge makes it harder to disrupt trade and transport.
But the project has had one stalwart critic. Matty Moroun, the trucking billionaire who purchased the Ambassador Bridge in 1979, ferociously protected his asset against potential competition. He actively sought to thwart the construction, launching numerous lawsuits against the state of Michigan and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the entity managing construction of the new bridge.
Those lawsuits continued even after Moroun’s death in 2020, as his heirs asserted significant damages to the value of their property.
 Was enough done for nearby homeowners?

Others have criticized the attempts to compensate the residents of Delray, a once-vibrant neighborhood that has been impacted by industrialization since the 1960s.
Benefits negotiated for residents and homeowners affected by the construction have not increased as the project’s costs ballooned and the timeline to complete it stretched out.
The cost of the Gordie Howe bridge is now estimated at around $6.4 billion Canadian – or about $US4.7 billion. That is $700 million more than the original projected cost. The project is at least 10 months behind schedule.

Simone Sagovac, director of the SW Detroit Community Benefit Coalition, said they did not anticipate the immense scale of the development and its continued effects on the community.
“That scale affected health and quality of life significantly every day, with years of continuous industrial dust causing sinus problems, headaches, and increasing asthma, and then there will be thousands of daily truck impacts to come,” Sagovac wrote to me in an email.
A baseline health impact assessment, issued in 2019 by University of Michigan researchers working closely with the coalition, expressed concern about the heightened airborne pollution that would likely activate asthma, especially in children. Matching the findings of so many other epidemiological studies, the assessment found that residents living within 500 feet (152 meters) of a truck route reported a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing asthma or allergies affecting their breathing.
Sagovac wrote that the project took 250 homes, 43 businesses and five churches by eminent domain, and “saw the closing of more after.” One hundred families left the neighborhood via a home swap program funded as a result of the benefits agreement administered by a local nonprofit. Two hundred and seventy families remain, but most businesses have left the area over decades of decline.
The families that remain are often long-term residents wanting or needing a cheap place to live and willing to put up with dust, noise and smells from nearby factories and a sewage treatment plant.
“They constantly face illegal dumping and other unanswered crimes, and will face the worst diesel emissions exposure and other trucking and industry impacts,” Sagovac wrote.
Heather Grondin, chief relations officer of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, wrote in
that they have taken steps to minimize impacts from construction and that they regularly meet with the community to hear concerns.
“Construction traffic is using designated haul routes to minimize community impacts, traffic congestion and wear and tear on existing infrastructure while maximizing public and construction safety,” Grondin wrote.
According to Grondin, cars will be forced to follow a “no idling” rule on the American side to minimize pollution. Other aspects of the Community Benefits Plan included $20,000 in free repairs for 100 homes, planting hundreds of trees and investing in programs addressing food insecurity and the needs of young people and seniors, Grondin wrote.
An updated Health Impacted Assessment is expected to be released later in 2025.
 History lost

Lloyd Baldwin, a historian for the Michigan Department of Transportation, was tasked with evaluating whether local landmarks like the legendary Kovacs Bar needed to be preserved.
“Kovacs Bar was one among many working-class bars in the Delray neighborhood but stands out for its roughly eight-decade association as a gathering place for the neighborhood and downriver Hungarian-American community,” Baldwin wrote in one such report.
The bar was nonetheless demolished in November 2017.
This was not MDOT’s only loss. While the agency made some sincere efforts to leverage other benefits for residents who remained, dynamic factors at many levels were out of the agency’s control.
For one thing, the numerous lawsuits filed by the bridge company over parcels of contested land limited MDOT’s ability to talk openly to the public about the land acquisition process.
In the period of legal limbo, Baldwin said, “the neighborhood imploded.”
Baldwin gave the example of the Berwalt Manor Apartments, built in the 1920s and located on Campbell Street near the bridge entrance. MDOT committed to preserve the historic building and proposed to mitigate the environmental impacts on mostly low-income residents by paying for new windows and HVAC units once the bridge was built.
But the speed of development outstripped the pace of community compensation. The building passed through probate court in 2018 and has since , so it is now unclear whether there are any low-income residents left to benefit from upgrades.
 Benefits yet to be measured

On the brighter side, environmentalists have pointed to the expansion and connection of bicycle trails and bird migration corridors as long-term benefits of the Gordie Howe bridge.
On the Canadian side, the bridge construction falls largely outside of Windsor’s residential neighborhoods, so it caused less disruption. As part of the project,bike lanes, enhanced landscaping, and gathering spaces were added to an approach road called Sandwich Street.
Cross-border tourism spurred on by a proposed system of greenways called the “Great Lakes Way” may provide new opportunities for people and money to flow across the Detroit River, improving the quality of life for communities that remain.
But if the trade war between the Trump administration and Canada continues, observers may question whether the bridge is a graceful gift of infrastructure to two nations or one of the world’s longest and skinniest white elephants.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Gov. Bill Lee’s Friday press conference about deploying the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis was long on spectacle but short on substance. 
Troops are set to arrive as soon as next week, but the public was given no clear sense of what success is supposed to look like. Will crime fall by 5%, 10% or 15% in the next two weeks, two months, or two years? Without concrete metrics, there is no way to hold the governor, local law enforcement or federal partners accountable.
The lack of clarity stretched across every level of leadership. When the police Chief C.J. Davis and the representative of the U.S. Marshals Service were asked who would lead on the ground, their answers were evasive. Neither the governor, Mayor Paul Young nor Davis offered a straightforward response. 
Lee didn’t even specify how many National Guard members will be deployed. Will it be 5? 15? 50? 150? This basic question, which is central to any credible plan, was left unanswered. Vagueness became the theme of the entire press conference, leaving Memphians in a dangerous position: our city is being reshaped by policies that lack definition, direction or accountability.

This is not public safety! This is what the civil rights lawyer and author Alec Karakatsanis calls “Copaganda.” 
Copaganda is the performance of policing and punishment designed to give the illusion of safety while avoiding the work of justice. It’s a press conference without a plan, a parade of uniforms without a measurable goal, the deployment of soldiers without a clear mission. It reassures some in the public while distracting from the deeper failures of leadership. And too often, it leaves Black communities carrying the burden of mass incarceration.
The problem is bigger than one press conference. Earlier this year, the Trump administration redirected federal funds away from local intervention programs that were making an impact on the ground in Memphis. Instead of supporting community-based organizations working to stop the violence, those resources are now being shifted into heavier-handed law enforcement tactics. 
And in May, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced it would close its investigation into the Memphis Police Department and retract a December 2024 report addressing constitutional violations by police. 
What we are witnessing now is the outgrowth of that failure: an overreliance on police and military muscle while underinvesting in the people and programs that actually reduce crime.
Even the language being used is misleading. When elected officials refer to  the National Guard “resources,” they distort the truth. Memphis doesn’t need more armed patrols in our neighborhoods; it needs jobs, counselors, after-school programs, trauma care and sustained investments in our young people. Calling soldiers “resources” is the kind of rhetorical trick that Copaganda thrives on — it makes people believe help is on the way, when in fact the wrong kind of help is being forced upon us.
Lee’s maneuvers also reek of political calculation. Memphis — a majority Black, majority Democratic city — is being used as a pawn to appease President Donald Trump and bolster the governor’s national ambitions. Instead of addressing poverty, underfunded schools or inadequate healthcare, we are handed a militarized stunt with no exit strategy and no clear measures of success.



				The vagueness of Gov. Bill Lee’s press conference leaves Memphians in a dangerous position: our city is being reshaped by policies that lack definition, direction or accountability.			


And make no mistake: when the cameras leave, it will be Black Memphians left holding the bag. The likely outcome of this so-called “test case” is more police contact, more arrests, more incarceration — and none of the long-term safety or justice our city desperately needs. Copaganda creates the appearance of urgency while avoiding the accountability of results.
If Memphis is truly the stage for this experiment, then those responsible must be required to state plainly what they are testing, how they will measure progress, and who will take responsibility when the results fall short. Until then, we must call this deployment what it is: not a strategy for safety, but a spectacle of Copaganda.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The phrase ‘government shutdown’ is younger than most members of Congress.
Fifty years ago, government shutdowns didn’t exist. But now, each fall, the nation groans as Congress turns one of its most fundamental duties — passing a budget — into a manufactured crisis. As the deadline approaches, Congress stalls, and shutdown threats dominate the headlines until a stopgap measure is slapped together at the eleventh hour.
The calendar is no secret, yet Washington repeats the same frustrating cycle as though the budget deadline appeared out of nowhere. It appears to be high drama, but it’s a failure of legislative responsibility and an executive misstep that traces back to the Carter administration.
Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown

Shutdowns were never meant to be part of our constitutional system. They emerged in 1980, when a 19th-century law was unilaterally reinterpreted by the Carter administration to allow distinctions between “essential” and “nonessential” services and require agencies to close when appropriations lapse.
For nearly two centuries before that, the federal government continued to function during budget gaps. The founders designed a republic where Congress — through open debate and compromise — would set priorities and authorize spending, not one where the threat of chaos could be wielded as leverage.
A proposal is on the table to get us off this embarrassing and costly budget shutdown merry-go-round. The “Prevent Government Shutdowns Act” (S. 2721/ H.R. 5130) would ensure that the government remains open while forcing Congress to stay in session until the budget work is done. This puts budget pressure where it belongs: on Congress, not on families.
Services would continue uninterrupted, but no new business would be funded. Worker furloughs and backpay bloat would no longer be an issue. Ending shutdown brinkmanship removes the distraction of manufactured crises and requires lawmakers to fulfill their core duty: deliberate, transparent budgeting on behalf of the people they represent.
States have already shown the way. Rhode Island, Wisconsin and North Carolina have automatic continuing appropriations that keep last year’s budget rolling until a new one is passed. Just this year, Kansas joined them. If statehouses can manage it, Congress can too. This isn’t just about protecting programs from disruption — it’s about restoring accountability to the branch of government constitutionally charged with the power of the purse.
Why does this matter? Because the budget isn’t just another bill. The budget drives all policy.
Every decision, from defense to Social Security to small grant programs, flows through the appropriations process. Failure to pass a budget undermines public trust, disrupts services for veterans and families, and rattles the economy. It also leads to “continuing resolutions” that freeze priorities in place instead of encouraging thoughtful decisions about where taxpayer dollars should go.
The shutdown prevention bill would restore predictability, protect taxpayers, and reinforce the legislative branch’s constitutional role. It would also remove the leverage small factions currently hold when they threaten shutdowns. For those who value limited government, this is exactly what we should want: a Congress that does its core job of budgeting responsibly.
This is why Mountain States Policy Center recently joined an open letter led by Americans for Prosperity urging Congress to pass these reforms. It reads, in part, “Automatic continuing appropriations advance inclusive, effective, legislature-driven budgeting. We urge Congress to enact the Prevent Government Shutdowns Act as soon as possible. It would strengthen America’s fiscal democracy, help Congress succeed, and support a more timely and effective appropriations process. Americans deserve a government that works.”
Shutdowns are a modern invention that weaken public trust and create unnecessary turmoil. Theatrics make headlines; statesmanship makes history. It’s time Congress chooses wisely.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderWhat’s the best way to celebrate World Contraception Day?
For some reproductive health advocates, the answer is clear: By breaking out a whimsical, 20-foot-tall inflatable statue of an IUD, affectionately known as Freeda Womb.
The art installation, which belongs to the nonpartisan organization Americans for Contraception, was also part of a 2024 tour aimed at increasing public awareness about contraception that included state capitols, the Philadelphia LOVE statue and even Burning Man. Spokesperson Liz Ernst said the statue serves both educational and metaphorical purposes.
“Many people do not know what an IUD looks like,” Ernst said, adding that its appearance in Georgia aims “to draw attention to two converging crises: A national assault on contraception, and Georgia’s own health emergency.”
Outside Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta on Friday, advocates gathered alongside state lawmakers to call attention to what they see as growing threats to reproductive health access for Georgia residents. 
State Rep. Dr. Michelle Au. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
State Rep. Dr. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat and anesthesiologist who has been a longtime advocate of reproductive rights, argued that a lack of access to health care for Georgia residents can lead to riskier pregnancies.
“Here in Georgia, you have a much higher chance of not having health insurance before pregnancy,” she said. “So that means conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, depression were all much more likely to have gone untreated prior to you getting pregnant, and that makes pregnancy harder.”
Au said that existing health disparities for pregnant Georgians combined with the state’s six-week abortion ban make access to birth control all the more important.
“It is hard to be a pregnant patient in Georgia, so protecting access to contraception, protecting the freedoms and the ability to take personal responsibility for our choices should be something we can all champion unequivocally.”
In Georgia, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill earlier this year to protect access to in vitro fertilization treatment in the wake of an Alabama court decision that ruled frozen embryos are children under state law. But a push to expand those protections to contraception has not gained momentum in Georgia. 
Democrats have pushed measures that would protect access to contraception. Late in the 2025 legislative session, Georgia Republicans championed a bill codifying birth control access that did not advance but remains alive for next year.  
For reproductive health advocates, the lack of action on the state level to protect access to contraception is troubling, especially given the benefits that birth control provides for a variety of different health conditions. 
“For many people, birth control is about much more than preventing pregnancy,” said Alicia Stallworth, the Southeast campaigns director at the nonprofit organization Reproductive Freedom for All. “It’s about managing painful periods, something I myself have dealt with due to uterine fibroids.”
Dr. Mimi Zieman, an Atlanta-based OB/GYN, also criticized Georgia’s ban on abortions after six weeks, cautioning that rollbacks of birth control access could follow. She also urged political leaders to enact policies that protect reproductive freedom.
“Abortion bans and contraceptive restrictions are two sides of the same coin,” she said. “When lawmakers mislabel birth control as abortifacients as a motive to limit access to birth control pills, morning after pills, IUDs and implants — which they are doing right now — or propose fetal personhood bills, they make it harder for physicians to provide evidence-based care.”

(Jeremiah Ariaz)The Kansas Mirror might sound, dear reader, like a parody publication of our own publication: The Kansas Reflector. The name is so similar that it reads like one of those fake student publications, a prank newspaper duplicated on a high school photocopier meant to lampoon the principal, football coach and cool kids. 
In real life, the Kansas Mirror exists in 2025 as a handheld piece of art: an installment in an emotive, in-progress photo project that freezes our state’s community newspapers as they are — crumbling and charming, brave and steadfast.
Its creator, Kansas native son Jeremiah Ariaz, has zigzagged the state with his cameras to create large-format photographs of our Fourth Estate.

The front page of the first installment of the Kansas Mirror, a photographic project by Jeremiah Ariaz, about the newspapers of Kansas.

The photos reveal newspaper offices — barren and familiar — along with their people — noble and analog. Presses, sitting recumbent, placid and muscular. Desks, littered with notes, books and dust.
Ariaz will visit Kansas State University for a presentation and discussion of his work, which is being displayed at the Beach Museum of Art. The event, from 5:30-6:30 p.m. Oct. 2 at the Beach Museum of Art, is free and open to the public.
Since the last time that I wrote about Ariaz, he published the first edition of the Kansas Mirror. From a distance, the 36 pages that showcase his work resemble the tabloid format of many small newspapers. (The installment is available for purchase on Ariaz’s website.)
Up close, the images pop more crisply from the taut paper than any old-time newspaper photographer would recognize. Ariaz worked through four different press runs to get the photo reproduction dialed in for the carefully chosen paper stock. And it shows in the sharp and saturated images. 
The format and quality of the printing also invites you to remove a spread and display it on your wall, outside the confines of the folded publication. 
Poetry and prose accompany the photos as “dispatches from across the Sunflower State.” Susan Lynn, the editor and publisher of the Iola Register, describes the shrinking coverage from neighboring newspapers.
A poem, titled “This Just In,” by Dodge City Globe editor Whitney Hodgin, relishes the “almost defunct” life of a newspaper journalist. She writes, “Might as well go down with the ship! / The water feels fine!”
The Marion County Record’s Eric Meyer, famous for his newspaper’s encounter with local law enforcement who raided his offices, writes: “What’s really needed are journalists willing to take on the challenge of helping lead communities — especially small isolated ones like this.”
Meyer’s columns of text pair up with Ariaz’s photo of an American flag, seemingly laid to rest on a bed of white. In the background of the image, you might swear you see a coffin lurking under a white drape.  
“Flag, Montgomery County Chronicle, Caney, KS, 2023.” (Jeremiah Ariaz)
Ariaz, during an interview with me last week, explained how he simply photographed things as he encountered them. When a dictionary sat open in the sunlight of an office window, he didn’t turn a page. The book just happened to display a meaningful span of definitions, from “disinheritance” to “disparagement.”
“There’s no way that I could ever plan such a thing,” said Ariaz, a photography professor at Louisiana State University. “It’s just that you’re responding to what you see, but you’re hoping that it can try to tell a bigger story.”
Below are a few other excerpts of our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity. 
“William Allen White, The Real Issue, Former Emporia Gazette Office, Emporia, KS.” (Jeremiah Ariaz)
One of the things that symbolically comes through to me, through the austerity of some of the images, is a feeling of isolation, nostalgia and mourning. Is that a mood that you were hoping to establish with the photographs? 
These newspaper offices are, in most cases, the longest-running businesses in those communities. They tend to occupy really prime real estate. They’re kind of gorgeous architecture, and the Emporia Gazette embodied all of that. It’s a building they occupied for 122 years, and it was in operation until just weeks before I arrived. The newspaper is still in operation, but it’s now in another space, in a much smaller location.
It felt like through those images, I was able to speak not just about the specificity of Kansas, but the images were really a conduit to speak about this in a much larger way. So, when you’re seeing details in the photographs, maybe peeling wallpaper, you’re seeing something that becomes a metaphor for the denigration of truth and facts in the public sphere, and that felt really important to me. 
I’m not a photojournalist. I’m not a photojournalist. I’m not thinking about them in that way. I’m thinking about them both in their relationship to Kansas, but also in a way for these images to speak about a loss that is greater than the single place or state. I’m seeking to represent what happens when a community loses a newspaper, a voice, a mirror to their community.
One of the bigger stories that you’re documenting here is the idea that press freedoms are in jeopardy. You photograph what’s happening with newspapers in Kansas and the financial reality. Also, many press freedoms being targeted in 2025 are political — not so much financial. People might strive to separate those two. Or do you see those things as being related?
The problem seems so big, and it seems so abstract. How do you begin to make sense of it? How do you begin to make sense of two newspaper offices closing, on average, every week when the number of reporters across the country has been cut in half? How does someone begin to conceptualize that? And for me, the photographs are not there to say how we got here. One of the things they show is the consequences of that loss, and they provide a way to visualize that, to feel the impact of it.

“Jim, Great Bend Tribune, Great Bend, KS, 2024.” (Jeremiah Ariaz)

Besides the Kansas Mirror, are there any other showcases of this work that you have envisioned?
I’m hoping ultimately to work in a venue that would give me the opportunity to realize sort of a multifaceted exhibition that combines these various elements.
One part of an exhibition that I showed last year in Nashville, Tennessee, was the exterior newspaper offices, just as they exist on Kansas streets. I really love those photographs because they really convey the architecture of the plains, the utilities, often simplicity and a real beauty.
I have a large collection of those. And when I installed those, a selection of those in Nashville, I did it in such a way that they would occupy a grid on the wall. And from that grid, some images were missing. There was a missing component that was representative of the percentage of newspapers that had closed in a period of time.
And then on the opposing wall to fill in those spaces — like literally — kind of a mirror to those open spaces are the same kind of photograph from newspaper offices in Kansas that closed. 
Seeing those two on two opposing walls, that’s an example of something that I would like to do at a much larger scale. So I probably had about 20 or 25 photographs in that exhibition, but that’s something that could be really enlarged. 
There’s a lot of different facets of the project, and I hope to be able to bring them collectively all together in an exhibition.
What do you hear from people who see your images? What sort of reactions do you get from your audience?
I would say there’s a kind of a dual response. I’m mostly showing these images in invited lectures. For example, there’s a conference called “Radically Rural” that happens annually in New Hampshire, and a big focus of that conference is local journalism. 
There’s a real empathetic response because they recognize that this is not just a representation of one place, but it’s something they identify with through their often long careers in small town newspaper offices. There’s something that feels so recognizable. 
To some degree, a point of tension is when I’ve shared this with Kansas communities. There’s a concern that the photographs might feel disparaging to the places that I’m photographing, or to the Kansas press, which is not at all my intention.
The photographs are meant to be something more than the singular place in which they are being made from. They’re really a window to think about, an invitation to think about loss on a much larger scale.
And so there is a bit of tension now I’m doing it in Kansas, because it’s the geographic center of the country. It’s my home state. It’s a place that I have a strong sense that there’s more newspapers in Kansas per population of that state, compared to other states. I’m sensitive to how some of those photographs have been received by people within the Kansas press.

(Getty stock photo)The Moore administration is facing increasing pressure from activists and the head of the Legislative Latino Caucus to boot a discount airline from Thurgood Marshall Baltimore Washington International Airport because it has been flying immigrants targeted for deportation to a detention facility in Louisiana.
The activists are calling out Avelo Airlines, which signed charter contracts earlier this year with the Department of Homeland Security to carry immigrants rounded up by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency from airports across the country to a detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana, where detainees arrive shackled and in handcuffs.
Avelo operated about 20% of the deportation flights in the U.S. in August, according to data compiled by the website Travel and Tour World.
Avelo’s contract with the federal government has sparked protests across the country – including in Maryland, where it has offered a limited number of commercial flights out of BWI since 2021 and currently runs four round-trip flights a week from the state-owned airport.
So far, even as Gov. Wes Moore (D) amps up criticism of President Donald Trump (R) and his agenda, the state has not sought to block Avelo from doing business at BWI.
Maryland’s deal with Avelo allows either party to walk away from the commercial flight arrangement with 30 days’ notice. But Moore administration officials assert they are powerless to stop ICE from running detainee flights out of BWI.
Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), the chair of the Latino Caucus, wrote to Moore and state transportation officials in mid-September, urging them to end their contract with Avelo because the airline is abetting the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants – which often results in immigrants who have legal status being removed from the country.
“I really deeply feel like if we have any control of the business taking place at BWI, we shouldn’t be supporting businesses that don’t reflect the values of Marylanders,” Martinez said in an interview.
He said Moore has yet to respond. But over just a few weeks, the Maryland groups targeting Avelo have collected more than 8,000 petition signatures, urging Moore to cancel the state contract with the airline.
“The main thing is putting pressure on the governor,” said Ryan Harvey, a leader of the Baltimore Rapid Response Network, one of several progressive groups organizing protests over Avelo’s commercial flights at BWI.
But even if the Moore administration sought to remove Avelo from BWI’s lineup of commercial flights, it cannot prevent Avelo or other carriers from running immigrant detainee flights out of BWI or other state airports. That’s because those trips are arranged and overseen by the federal government, and the state is obligated to allow those flights to use airport runways and control towers. The state government has jurisdiction over the BWI terminal and associated businesses, but not airport runways or other flight operations.
‘Aiding Trump’s deportation campaign’
Avelo launched in 2021, just as the U.S. was beginning to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, offering low-cost flights in the U.S. and to nearby Caribbean islands. The carrier began providing commercial service to and from BWI in spring 2022.
“We are thrilled to welcome Avelo Airlines to our market,” Ricky Smith, who was then the executive director of the Maryland Aviation Administration, said at the time. “Avelo will offer low fares and convenient access, and will boost tourism to Maryland and the entire National Capital region. We remain committed to growing our air service portfolio and adding new travel options for our customers.”
Avelo’s financial journey since its launch has been tenuous, according to a recent account by Forbes, which may explain why the airline signed federal contracts worth an estimated $150 million to transport undocumented immigrants.
The blowback has been swift and vocal, with protests erupting across the country. Some call for passengers to boycott the airline, while others have urged government officials to eliminate financial incentives to Avelo for its commercial operations – or to block the operations altogether.
A New York Times article, noting that Avelo flies to several “liberal cities on the coasts,” suggested the airline is “aiding Trump’s deportation campaign.”
Harvey said Maryland activists were inspired when they heard about protests targeting Avelo in Connecticut, which have spread across the country.
“The national campaign is a bunch of local, grass-roots operations that got in touch with each other,” he said.
Similarly, Martinez said lawmakers in Maryland, responding to the concerns of their constituents, have spoken to their counterparts in other states about strategy and tactics.
“I’ve heard from constituents throughout my district,” he said. “They’re really concerned that their tax dollars are being used in some way to deport their neighbors.”
The 2022 deal struck between Avelo and Maryland transportation officials allows either party to terminate the contract for the airline to run commercial flights out of BWI with just 30 days’ notice – which means Moore could end the agreement in short order.
“There should be no repercussions if the state decided that Avelo should pack up in 30 days,” Harvey said.
Jonathan Dean, a spokesperson for the Maryland Aviation Administration and BWI, said the state provided no financial incentives to the airline when it arrived in 2022. He said information on what revenues the state is deriving from the arrangement with Avelo could only be obtained through a Maryland Public Information Act request. Commercial airlines typically pay the state landing fees and charges related to facilities and equipment rental at BWI.
Avelo is currently running a total of four round-trip commercial flights a week in and out of BWI, to and from New Haven, Connecticut, and to and from Wilmington, North Carolina, Dean said. Between July 1, 2024, and June 30 this year, Avelo flew 36,164 commercial passengers at BWI, he said, for a passenger market share of 0.14%.
Courtney Goff, a spokesperson for Avelo, told Maryland Matters that the airline is aware of the protests in Maryland and across the country. But she referred questions on the ICE flights to the Department of Homeland Security.
“We recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and assert their freedom of speech,” Goff said in an email. “Avelo’s main priority continues to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation that nearly eight million Customers across the country continue to enjoy.”
The ICE media office did not respond to an email with a series of questions about possible detainee flights out of Maryland airports in 2025.
But even if Maryland ended its arrangement with Avelo for commercial flights, that would not prevent Avelo or other carriers from running detainee flights out of BWI or other state airports.
Flights arranged by ICE “are part of a private contract between a flight operator and the federal government,” Dean said.
“A number of these flights have been arranged by the federal government and flown through a private fixed-base operator at BWI Marshall Airport. The national airspace, airline operations, and access to airports are regulated by federal law,” Dean said. “As a federally funded, public-use airport, BWI Marshall Airport is required by federal law to provide access to all certified air carriers without discrimination.
“The Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) does not schedule, inspect, or authorize these flights,” he added.
Dean said MAA officials are aware of one ICE flight that Avelo operated this year carrying immigrants from BWI to the detention center in Louisiana. That’s one of about 30 detainee flights that departed from BWI this year, he said. The others have been operated by GlobalX, a charter airline, and the U.S. Coast Guard.
These flights have yielded no revenues for the state, Dean said. Activists will continue to pressure state policymakers on Avelo, Harvey said.
“Marylanders would like to see leaders do more,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2205333267-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-27 07:56:30.775687

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)There is no bright flash or loud bang, no sharp crackling sound. But the rushing waters of the Potomac River have been electrified.
And for a moment, nothing changes.
But suddenly, they rise to the surface one by one, writhing briefly before they lie still — dozens and dozens of invasive blue and flathead catfish, previously hidden in the gray-blue depths beneath the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, connecting Maryland’s Oxon Hill to Virginia’s Alexandria.
The fish, with their white bellies and small fins pointed skyward, aren’t dead — just stunned. But the biologists aboard the small Maryland Department of Natural Resources jon boat only have a a few minutes before the fish come to their senses and descend once more.
In that time, the small group of scientists can’t hope to collect every fish — at least a hundred in all — in their handheld dip nets, even though extricating the invasive species from the Chesapeake Bay is the ultimate goal.
This experiment in electrofishing, as it’s known, is more to give scientists a snapshot of what is normally concealed: Just how many of the whiskered invaders lurk in one stretch of the Potomac, in a roughly 50-yard radius surrounding the tiny motorboat delivering the shock.

Electrofishing is just one strategy that Maryland policymakers have employed to do battle against the catfish, some of the more prolific invasive species to ever gain a foothold in the Chesapeake Bay after being introduced in Virginia waters in the 1970s.
Blue catfish in particular are known for their indiscriminate appetites, meaning they devour treasured native species from striped bass to blue crabs, and have essentially become a new apex predator in many reaches of the bay. Dozens of species have been found in the stomachs of a single blue catfish, including a variety of crabs, clams, mussels and fish.
Many of the tactics to suppress the bay’s catfish aim to grow a commercial and charter fishery — and encourage restaurants, grocery stores and diners to buy in. Recent changes in Maryland have included allowing charter boats to sell any excess fish that patrons don’t take home.
But Maryland Natural Resource officials and ecosystem scientists are also racing to “know thy enemy,” and uncover more intel about the fishes’ diet, behaviors and population density.
That’s where electrofishing comes in.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The DNR boat — emblazoned with warnings like “High Voltage, Keep Away” — is also outfitted with two outstretched metal arms, each with a set of slender prongs dipping into the water, which deliver the electrical current.
The method has been used for decades by marine scientists to capture and study a variety of species, but it can be customized to largely target catfish, by adjusting the frequency, said Branson Williams, invasive fishes program manager at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Catfish are particularly sensitive to low-frequency electrical pulses, around 15 hertz.
For other fish, the ideal frequency is higher, around 60 hertz. Northern snakeheads, recently renamed Chesapeake Channa in Maryland, respond best to higher-frequency 120 Hertz pulses, Williams said.
Researchers believe that blue catfish may be vulnerable to lower frequency electrofishing because they are electroreceptive — they possess organs called ampullae of Lorenzini, gel-filled pockets that can detect electric fields, which are more commonly associated with sharks and rays, according to a 2023 article in the North American Journal of Fisheries Management.

“They can detect electric currents like sharks,” Williams said. “When we shock the water, it seems like we kind of overload that system.”
The technology has its limitations. For instance, it can’t be used in saltier water due to its high conductivity, so it can be used in the Chesapeake Bay’s freshwater tributaries, but not in much of the bay’s main stem, which is largely brackish. While the upper bay is fairly fresh, it becomes saltier as you head south toward the Atlantic Ocean, reaching salinity levels of 25 to 30 parts per trillion.
“Two parts [per trillion], fish will come to the surface and go right back down,” Williams said. “It’s kind of a rodeo.”
The department has been using the electrofishing technique on catfish for several years. But now, officials are exploring ways to sharpen it.
Williams said the department is working with university and private partners to evaluate whether drones can effectively photograph the number of catfish lying belly-up in the water, hopefully making counting easier.
And this year, as part of a pilot program, the department commissioned a group of seven volunteer watermen to serve as “chase boat” operators during electrofishing trips, and scoop up as many catfish as possible before the effects wear off. The watermen are allowed to sell that catch.
The group has electrofished at 47 different sites on four different Maryland rivers: the Chester, the Choptank, the Patuxent and the Sassafras. The department plans to offer the program again next year, Williams said.

Williams said some of the watermen were surprised to see just how many catfish rose to the surface, and just how little time they had to capture as many as they could. And once an area is shocked, scientists don’t return again, because the fish become less susceptible to the electrical pulses, Williams said.
“You get one shot,” Williams said.
The September trip was for the benefit of a group of environmental advocates, gathered by Annapolis-based Choose Clean Water Coalition, who watched the demonstration from a nearby vessel.
“Ooh!” yelped some of the onlookers, as the fish squirmed to the surface. “Oh wow,” one said. “Do they feel it?” called another.
The coalition, which represents more than 300 local, state and national organizations focused on improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay region, turned its attention to blue catfish policy in 2023. At the federal level, the group is backing a bill from Maryland Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) that would explore using blue catfish in pet food.
But the coalition has also been among the groups pushing to remove a requirement that wild-caught blue catfish must be inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — rather than the Food and Drug Administration — a more stringent process that requires an on-site inspector.
The requirement came in the 2008 federal Farm Bill, supported by domestic catfish farmers who wanted to insulate their product against foreign competition. But the coalition believes it is slowing down the effort to catch and process the Chesapeake Bay’s wild-caught blue catfish.
Peter Marx, a federal affairs contractor for the coalition, said recent efforts to undo the rule exclusively in the Chesapeake have been stymied by the Mississippi delegation, which is wary of creating a “slippery slope.”
But Tom O’Connell, director of the Eastern Ecological Science Center for the U.S. Geological Survey, who joined the electrofishing trip, said its also important for fishery managers to think beyond developing and strengthening the commercial market for catfish in the region. That’s why studying strategies like electrofishing is so important, he said.
“If our fishermen are successful — which is great — they may knock down the population to the level which is no longer economically viable for them,” O’Connell said. “So, we need to be thinking about alternative strategy, more efficient gears, different techniques.”

During his remarks aboard the boat, O’Connell briefly mentioned changes to his agency amid President Donald Trump’s (R) tenure, which have included slimming down the agency’s staff.
“In the federal government, we’re seeing a lot of change, a lot of uncertainty,” O’Connell said. “We’re going to continue to provide the science to support the administration’s priorities, and hopefully Chesapeake Bay restoration.”
During the trip in the Potomac, the Maryland biologists netted a variety of blues and flatheads as the environmentalists looked on, including a blue catfish weighing 34.9 pounds, which elicited gasps from the crowd of advocates as biologists hoisted into the air.
Since they’re far from picky eaters, blue catfish can grow to extraordinary sizes. The Maryland state record for blue catfish is 84 pounds, a record that has stood since 2012, despite the species’ increased proliferation in Maryland waters.
The demonstration even attracted a bald eagle in search of an easy meal, which dipped its talons into the water and scooped up a fish of its own.
But the rest of the fish, including the 34-pounder, were bound for a local church’s fish fry, said Tim Groves, a 37-year veteran of Maryland DNR, who works as a biologist in the southern region.
Groves said that he developed connections with local churches and food pantries to donate the large quantities of catfish that the scientists collected during electrofishing operations, particularly during a study that occurred amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“People said ‘Oh, you just need to bury them,’” Groves said. “I can’t consciously do that when there’s hungry people.”

(Photo by Staff Sgt. Steven Adkins/U.S. Air Force)Earlier this summer, in a major win for Maryland gas customers, utility regulators at the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) made an announcement that will save gas customers $1 billion over the next decade.
Each year, gas companies, like Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) and Washington Gas, spend hundreds of millions of dollars connecting new Maryland homes to methane gas pipelines. The utility companies charge existing gas customers for some or all the cost of hooking up new customers to their sprawling network of methane gas pipelines through a policy called line extension allowances (LEAs), which is added to customers’ distribution rates.
Who profits from this spending? Gas utilities. These companies profit up to $3 for every $1 they spend hooking up new homes to gas. While corporate executives and shareholders earn substantial profits off this work, they take none of the risk because customers pay for the costs of the pipes plus interest—payments buried in your gas delivery charges on monthly utility bills.
But thanks to the PSC, this is about to change. Under the new rules, gas customers will no longer be on the hook to cover the cost of system expansion. New customers can still choose to connect to the gas system, but will be responsible for the cost of doing so.

This commonsense step maintains customer choice, while protecting customers from rapidly escalating costs. According to the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, ending this practice will save BGE and Washington Gas customers an estimated $150 million annually, and more than $1 billion over the next decade. Maryland is joining states like New York, Colorado, and Massachusetts who are ending gas line extension policies.
Outdated policies like line extension allowances have contributed to gas companies driving up customers’ bills and raking in record profits. In 2025, alone, BGE planned to spend $103.5 million on new gas hookups. After accounting for interest and utility profits, BGE will charge customers $397 million to cover those costs. Meanwhile, Washington Gas’ planned to spend $56.25 million on line extension allowances in 2025, and the company will charge customers $238 million, more than four times the initial cost.
The mounting cost of gas bills has put a strain on Maryland small businesses and families. In BGE’s territory alone, gas rates have tripled from 2010 to 2023, far outpacing inflation due in large part to excessive spending from BGE on gas line extensions, pipe replacements and other capital projects. This spending is a key factor in BGE profits more than doubling from $210 million in 2013 to $527 million in 2024.
The methane gas system also creates serious risk of explosions and puts our health at risk through polluting gas equipment in our homes, which is responsible for more than $1.3 billion in annual health impacts.
We’re grateful that the PSC and elected officials are responding to the gas affordability crisis in Maryland. The PSC decision leaves the choice to have gas in individual customers’ hands, while wisely ending an expensive, outdated policy that is contributing to escalating rates. And earlier this year, the Maryland General Assembly passed bipartisan legislation known as the Ratepayer Protection Act to rein in this gas pipeline spending to prioritize safety and protect consumers.
The Commission’s decision on gas line extension policy is part of a larger proceeding on the future of gas heat in Maryland. In response to rapidly escalating gas utility costs, the Commission is investigating options to protect ratepayers and ensure regulatory decisions align with state policy, and has appointed a Special Master to oversee the formal proceedings, which began on  Sept. 16.
We’re hopeful the legislature, governor and PSC will continue to work together to address rising gas utility costs by fully implementing the Ratepayer Protection Act and lower the utilities’ incentive for wasteful capital spending.
Instead of spending billions of dollars on expanding a gas system that locks us into burning polluting fossil fuels far into the future, we should make BGE and Washington Gas address pressing safety risks, stop needlessly raising our gas bills, and start taking meaningful action to transition to more efficient, clean energy homes.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/7055499-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-27 06:56:24.867178

(Photo by Senior Airman Cydney Lee/U.S. Air Force)Earlier this summer, the Maryland Public Service Commission issued a ruling that marks  a dramatic departure from decades of balanced energy policy. Under the new proposal,  Marylanders must pay the full upfront cost of connecting to natural gas – often hundreds  or thousands of dollars – rather than paying those costs over time.
This change is no minor technicality. By requiring new customers and homebuilders to  shoulder the full upfront cost of establishing natural gas service, the commission is  putting an affordable, reliable energy option out of reach for many families and  businesses. This comes as residents are already facing record-high energy bills and the  state’s electric grid is struggling to keep up with demand. And it means extra costs for  homebuilders and developers that will likely be passed on to homebuyers.
The commission pointed to Maryland’s climate goals to justify its decision. There’s no  doubt that the realities of climate change demand action around how we power our  lives. But those actions must be grounded in solid evidence, keep energy affordable for  customers, and take into account Maryland’s current and future energy supply and  demand.
The commission offered no explanation for how ending this policy will reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. Nor did it address how the state’s already strained power  grid will support the increased household electric demand likely to result from the  change. The lack of analysis on what this will cost families and businesses is also  unaddressed.

As the leader of the Maryland Building Industry Association, I represent more than  100,000 home builders, remodelers, developers and other building professionals. We  urgently need policies that promote homebuilding and expand access to home  ownership, not ones that drive up costs and put owning a home further out of reach.  Unfortunately, this policy does exactly that.
This is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a troubling shift in Maryland’s energy policy – one that risks higher costs to consumers, a less reliable power grid, and more difficulty  attracting industry and new jobs to our state.
From new building standards to restrictions on how we heat our homes, Maryland  leaders seem to be advancing a one-size-fits-all energy agenda that aggressively  supports electrification, regardless of consumer preferences, affordability or impact on  energy reliability. Natural gas is approximately three times more affordable than  electricity and is often the preferred choice for cooking and heating. Yet, the state is  making it harder to access through changes like the one proposed. The result: higher  utility bills and fewer options.
At a time when Marylanders are already stretched thin by inflation and rising housing  costs, these added burdens make it harder for families to make ends meet and for small  businesses to grow. This isn’t just energy policy. It’s a cost-of-living issue, a housing  issue, and a jobs issue.
Maryland’s electric grid is not suited for the weight of a fully electrified economy.  Already, during heatwaves and cold snaps, the system is pushed to its limits. Just this  month, thousands of electric customers in Maryland experienced outages. In the past  two years, wholesale electricity prices in the PJM market – the region’s grid operator – are up over 1000%.
By sidelining natural gas, the commission is jeopardizing energy reliability. A diverse,  balanced energy mix that includes natural gas is the smartest way to ensure residents  can keep the lights on and their houses cooled and heated during even the most high-demand periods.
We support a pragmatic climate and energy strategy rooted in facts, fairness, and  common sense. Maryland can take action to address climate change without closing the  door on affordability, energy resilience, and consumer choice.
It’s time for a more balanced, inclusive approach – one that honors what Marylanders want and puts people, not politics, at the center of our energy future. At the Maryland  Building Industry Association, we’re ready and willing to work with the state to find real  energy solutions.

(Photo by Thomas Quinn/University of Washington, provided by the Environmental Protection Agency)The commercial salmon harvest in Alaska’s Bristol Bay, site of the world’s largest sockeye salmon runs, held a mixture of good news and bad news this year.
The run of sockeye salmon, also known as red salmon, exceeded preseason expectations and totaled 56.7 million fish, the seventh highest since 2005, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game reported in its preliminary summary of the summer harvest. The commercial sockeye harvest was also bigger than expected, totaling 41.2 million fish. That was 18% above the preseason forecast and 23% higher than the recent 20-year average.
The total amount of money paid to fishers delivering their catches totaled $215.3 million, about 7% above the 20-year average of $200.7 million, the department said in its summary.
The bad news is that while Bristol Bay sockeye salmon continued what has been a streak of huge runs – and while sockeye dominate the commercial harvest — other salmon species there continued to falter. Bristol Bay’s harvest of Chinook, also known as king salmon, hit a 20-year low this year, totaling only 6,148 fish, compared to the most recent 20-year average of 33,469 Chinook, the department reported.
Chinook salmon runs have been weak across much of Alaska and the North Pacific, so the decline is not unique to Bristol Bay.

	The opposite trends of Bristol Bay sockeye and Chinook salmon have not been fully explained. One hypothesis is that climate change currently favors sockeye, which spawn in warming lakes where habitat may be expanding, over river-spawning Chinook.
Tim Sands, a Bristol Bay area management biologist, believes that warming has something to do with the sockeye-Chinook divergence.
He said warmer winters at the higher elevation lakes in Bristol Bay’s Wood River and Nushagak River systems have expanded the ice-free growing season for young salmon.
“These slightly longer growing seasons allow for slightly larger juveniles that are a tad bit more competitive when they enter the ocean and survive at a little higher rate,” he said by email. “The ocean environment is also more hospitable for juvenile sockeye salmon.”
Why that is true for sockeye but not Chinook is something he does not know, he said.
It is difficult to figure out what is happening to salmon after they return to the open ocean, said Bert Lewis, a regional supervisor for the department’s Division of Commercial Fisheries. “That is kind of a black box in our understanding,” he said.
To try to find some answers, the department operates a Salmon Ocean Ecology Program with some scientific partners.
Another important trend – the average size of Bristol Bay salmon – provided some mixed signals.
The harvested sockeye weighed in at an average of 5.1 pounds apiece, above last year’s record-small average size of 4.53 pounds and slightly above the 4.9 pound average of the past five years, according to the department.

	Still, Bristol Bay sockeye are significantly smaller now than they were decades ago, when fish typically weighed in at 6 to 6.5 pounds.
Sands said this year’s mix of fish ages account for the improvement in average fish size.
According to department surveys, 61% of the returning fish had spent three years out in the ocean, compared to 38% that had spent only two years. That was a big contrast with last year, when about 80% of the returning fish had been growing in the ocean for only two years, according to last year’s Fish and Game summary.
Last year’s big skew toward younger fish was an “outlier,” Sands said. He tied that to the hot and dry conditions of 2019, which inhibited reproduction of the salmon that would have normally returned in 2024 after spending three years in the ocean.
Lewis said the department has been monitoring the fish sizes closely. The trend to smaller sizes was first detected in Copper River Chinook, he said. While the trend is especially pronounced in Chinook, it is now happening in other species and around the state.
The relatively small size of individual fish in Bristol Bay might have something to do with the huge size of the runs, where “abundance has exploded,” Lewis said.
This was the 11th straight year with a Bristol Bay sockeye run exceeding 50 million fish, according to the department’s summary. And generally, bigger runs are made up of smaller fish, Lewis said.
 “The adage big run-small fish, small run-big fish seems to apply here,” he said.

Santiago/Getty Images)Nevada was removed from the Trump administration’s list of “sanctuary” states this week after Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed an agreement with the Department of Justice to fully collaborate on federal immigration enforcement — making Nevada the first state to be removed from the list.
Nevada was initially placed on the federal list of sanctuary jurisdictions on Aug. 5 following an executive order by President Donald Trump directing the Justice Department – in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security – to identify places where officials “continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws.”
Lombardo has denied Nevada’s status as a sanctuary state since making it on the list, and said the agreement “reaffirms our commitment to following federal immigration law in Nevada.”
In a statement announcing the agreement, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said “We applaud Governor Lombardo and Nevada for taking necessary steps to fully comply with the Trump Administration’s immigration policy. This should serve as a reminder to other jurisdictions: come to the table and work with us instead of going to court.” 
Nevada plans to use FEMA funding to upgrade Washoe County Jail for ICE

The agreement lists several commitments Nevada must make to remain off the list of sanctuary states in the future, including the continued use of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to assist in federal immigration operations. 
In August, Nevada agreed to use FEMA funds to upgrade detention facilities at the Washoe County Jail to include dedicated holding cells and office space for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Under the agreement, Nevada will also continue to use the state’s National Guard to provide administrative support in immigration enforcement operations. 
“DOJ will provide notice of further opportunities for Nevada to collaborate with the federal government on immigration enforcement including identification of laws and policies that impede federal law enforcement,” the agreement reads. 
The agreement points to several policies that lead the Justice Department to place Nevada on the list of sanctuary jurisdictions, including the state’s “Model Immigration Policies,” which offers guidance from the Nevada Attorney General to state employees on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
The non-binding policies were mandated by the Nevada Legislature in 2021 and include guidance for limiting immigration enforcement in public spaces, while also complying with federal law.
Lombardo accused Nevada’s Attorney General Aaron Ford of attempting to “implement sanctuary policies” through the model immigration policies.
“Despite the Attorney General’s attempts to implement sanctuary policies, Nevada is not a sanctuary state, has never been a sanctuary state, and will never be a sanctuary state under my leadership,” Lombardo said.
Lombardo hammered for authorizing Nevada National Guard to help ICE

The agreement also notes that “Nevada will take steps available in law to counter-balance any actions the Nevada Attorney General and Nevada Legislature may take to enact unlawful sanctuary policies.”
In response to Lombardo’s comment and the agreement, Ford emphasized that he has “never supported sanctuary for criminals.”
“The sanctuary designation from the Trump administration happened on Governor Lombardo’s watch — which is yet another failure of his tenure,” Ford said. “Unlike the governor, I have actually passed legislation to crack down on fentanyl being trafficked across our border, and have won more than $1 billion to combat the opioid issue right here in Nevada.”
The agreement outlines several actions Lombardo and state officials took to remove Nevada from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions, including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department rejoining the federal 287(g) program in June, which authorizes officers to perform some immigration enforcement functions.
Lombardo’s veto of a bill that would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school or provide student records without a warrant was also highlighted in the agreement.
The agreement also noted actions Lombardo took to stop Nevada’s Office for New Americans from providing legal assistance referrals for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and those seeking Temporary Protected Status or Legal Permanent Residency.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x6831758914118-1.jpg,,,2025-09-26 22:57:22.158240

NPM, previously known as Nebraska Educational Telecommunications, interviewed Neihardt, known for writing “Black Elk Speaks,” including by one of its best-known broadcasters, Ron Hull. Those discussions eventually led New York-based TV talk show host Dick Cavett to host Neihardt for a lengthier interview that Cavett — a Nebraska native — called one of his most memorable.
The group’s Wordsender Award honors people and organizations that share Neihardt’s writings, themes and how he wrote and felt about the frontier, Native Americans and more. “Wordsender” is how Black Elk described Neihardt, an author and poet who sent an accurate version his story to others.
NPM will receive the award Nov. 9, during the group’s “Laureate’s Feast” at Omaha’s German-American Society. Tickets are available at neihardt.org or the Neihardt State Historic Site at 402-648-3388.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game may allow personal watercraft, commonly called Jet Skis, in Kachemak Bay south of  Homer.
The unanimous decision by the five-member court overturned a lower-court judge who had ruled in 2023 that the state could not eliminate a Jet Ski ban once it was imposed.
The state of Alaska moved to allow Jet Skis in 2019 in Gov. Dunleavy’s first term after lobbying by personal watercraft groups, including the Personal Watercraft Club of Alaska.
Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox and ADF&G Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said by email on Friday that the ruling has broader implications than Kachemak Bay because the justices affirmed that if the executive branch imposes a regulation, it implicitly has the power to reverse that regulation.
“Today’s decision is a win for Alaskans who value access to our waters. It confirms the Department’s ability to remove outdated rules and ensure our parks and public lands remain open for responsible recreation. We’re pleased the Court recognized the importance of keeping regulations flexible and reflective of how Alaskans enjoy the outdoors,” Vincent-Lang said.
Four local groups — Cook Inleteekper, the Kachemak Bay Conservation Society, the Alaska Quiet Rights Coalition and Friends of Kachemak Bay State Park — had sued the state in 2021 after the Dunleavy administration lifted a Jet Ski ban that had been in place since 2001.
Attorney Sam Gottstein represented the four groups in court and said by phone Friday, “Although we are disappointed in the decision, I think it is fair to say that this ruling generally recognizes an agency’s authority to modify or repeal its own regulations.”
Earlier this year, Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued Administrative Order 360, which launched a yearslong, statewide effort to repeal “burdensome” regulations.
“This is a win for Alaskans. The Alaska Supreme Court affirms our authority to repeal outdated rules when the facts don’t justify them. That’s exactly the AO 360 playbook: take a hard look, cut red tape, protect what matters. More commonsense regulatory reform ahead,” Cox said by email.
In Friday’s 36-page order, Justice Jude Pate — writing on behalf of the court — said that the Fish and Game commissioner “had the regulatory authority to enact (a ban), and this authority necessarily includes the authority to repeal (the ban).”
Gottstein had argued unsuccessfully in court that state law only permitted regulatory changes for the purpose of environmental conservation, effectively allowing only a one-way door.
“It’s like a parent saying, ‘I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it,’” he told the court in 2024. “The reality is, no parent has that right, just like Fish and Game doesn’t have that right.”
But Pate appeared skeptical of that position during oral arguments and rejected it in Friday’s written order.
Citing other states’ supreme courts and federal court rulings, he wrote, “as other state and federal courts have noted, agencies generally have the authority to amend or repeal their own regulations. That authority is implied from the agency’s authority to promulgate rules in the first place.”
If agencies weren’t allowed to repeal regulations, it “would spawn zombie regulations, unslayable once promulgated, no matter the passage of time or change in circumstances,” Pate wrote.
The groups challenging the state had also argued that the Dunleavy administration’s decision to repeal the Jet Ski ban was predetermined. They submitted two internal emails as evidence, but the court determined that those didn’t help the groups’ case. 
The emails fell short of establishing that the governor’s office was certain that the repeal would occur, much less that the governor predetermined the outcome of the regulatory process, Pate wrote. 
The court concluded that the Department of Fish and Game appropriately took a “hard look” at available scientific evidence and facts before lifting the ban, including the fact that modern Jet Skis are less polluting and quieter than they were when the ban was imposed.
The Supreme Court ordered that the case be returned to Superior Court for final proceedings.

(Photo by Cam Byrnes)The Trump administration is planning to close some U.S. Forest Service offices in Alaska under a national reorganization announced this summer by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
Public comment on the reorganization is open through Sep. 30.
The Forest Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, currently has offices in Anchorage, Juneau, Cordova, Valdez, Girdwood, Seward, Craig, Hoonah, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, Thorne Bay, Wrangell and Yakutat. It isn’t clear how many of those offices will remain open after the reorganization. 
The status of the Forest Service’s tourist-focused visitor centers in Portage, Juneau and Ketchikan also isn’t clear.
Contacted for details, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said by email on Friday, “Some aspects of the reorganization will take place over the coming months, while others will take more time. We will continue to provide updates as the reorganization moves forward.”
They added, “We recognize this may be difficult, but we are hopeful that affected employees will remain with us through this transition as we work to improve and continue delivering benefits to the people and communities we serve.”
In a July memo outlining the basic details of the plan, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said she intends to close the Forest Service’s nine national regional offices “over the next year” but “will maintain a reduced state office in Juneau, Alaska, and an eastern service center in Athens, Georgia.”
Research stations, like the Juneau Forestry Science Laboratory in Auke Bay, will be closed and “consolidated into a single location in Fort Collins, Colorado.”
Nationally, Rollins said she intends to scatter more than half of the Agriculture Department’s 4,600 Washington, D.C.-based administrators to five regional hubs; one each in Utah, Colorado, North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana.
This follows prior actions by the federal Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which earlier this year fired about 3,400 Forest Service employees nationally, including more than 100 in Alaska. 
Before the firings, the Forest Service had about 700 employees in Alaska.

BURLINGTON — A federal judge sentenced the man who pulled the trigger in a fatal murder-for-hire plot to more than 16 years behind bars while ordering the man who recruited him to a lighter prison term. 
Judge Christina Reiss sentenced Jerry Banks and Aron Lee Ethridge on Friday for their roles in the death of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville more than seven years ago.
The hearings for the two men in federal court in Burlington came a day after the judge addressed the cases of two other men convicted for their roles in the same deadly scheme. 
During the Friday hearing for Banks, the man who carried out the murder, Reiss gave Banks 200 months, or just over 16 years, followed by five years of post-release supervision. The judge spoke about balancing the role each man played in the crime with the sentences they would get.
“One of my concerns in this case is disparity,” Reiss said.

The judge called Banks’ role in the crime “abhorrent” and “heinous” and emphasized he was ultimately the one who pulled the trigger. But Reiss also said she believed Ethridge had exploited Banks, who had a history of mental illnesses and substance abuse, into carrying out the crime at one of the lowest points in his life. 
Later Friday afternoon, Reiss sentenced Ethridge to 140 months, or more than 11 years, for his role in the murder.
Reiss said Ethridge’s cooperation with law enforcement, two days after he was initially questioned, was one of the most timely she had ever seen. She also recognized he did so without an agreement for a lesser sentence, other than the death penalty being taken off the table. 
“Your cooperation set the dominos in motion,” she said, adding that he helped investigators nail down the roles of the others in the murder plot.
Yet, the judge said, Ethridge still played a central role in the murder scheme that involved three other men.
“Nobody said no,” Reiss said.
The two sentencing hearings featured defense attorneys talking about their clients’ pasts and what eventually brought them together.
Banks, 38, grew up surrounded by violence, drugs and alcohol, facing housing insecurity without stable parental support after his father left when he was 4 years old. His mother struggled with addiction. When Ethridge — his closest friend at the time —- asked him to carry out the murder, Banks had just lost his dog and had recently broken up with his girlfriend after a decadelong relationship. 
“I will do better if I get out,” Banks said in court, apologizing to the Davis family for the crime and adding that, although he can never make amends for what he did, he wants to be a good person moving forward. 
Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ widow, also addressed Banks during the hearing. A photo of her with her seven children was projected on courtroom monitors as she spoke.
“This is the hardest of the four statements I must give because today I stand before my husband’s killer,” she said. 
Melissa Davis recalled how Banks kidnapped her husband from their home on a night in January 2018, and how months before, he had spied on them, watching their children run in and out of the house. 
“Yet you were not moved by the love of family you witnessed,” she said. 
“But after years of tears and prayer, I can stand here today strong enough to say, ‘I forgive you,’” Melissa Davis said, looking at Banks, who returned her gaze, nodded and whispered, “thank you.”
Banks, a former jail guard who had lived in Fort Garland, Colorado, pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors to charges of murder for hire, conspiracy to kidnap and money laundering. Under the terms of the agreement, he could have been sentenced to life in prison. 
Steven Barth, Banks’ attorney, asked the judge to impose a prison sentence of 12.5 years, contending that Ethridge “exploited” and “took advantage” of Banks’ vulnerabilities in convincing him to carry out the killing. 
Banks, Barth added, saw Ethridge not only as a friend, but as a father figure and mentor whom he wanted to please. 
Ethridge, in speaking to the judge later, denied that he ever pressured Banks.
Even if Banks had backed out at some point, his attorney said, it was “inevitable” that the other three men involved in the plot were going to make sure that Gregory Davis was killed.
“The parties were dead set, with or without him,” Barth said.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig disputed that the killing would have happened even if Banks had pulled out. He called on the judge to impose a prison term of 20 years. Stendig said that while Ethridge may have egged on Banks to carry out the killing, it was Banks who ultimately pulled the trigger. 
Stendig also outlined the “chilling” and premeditated nature of Gregory Davis’ killing. The prosecutor rattled off the string of states Banks had to drive through to get from Colorado to Vermont, stating that he could have backed out any time along the trip, but he didn’t.
Pretending to be a U.S. marshal, complete with a badge, Banks told Davis he was under arrest and presented him with a phony arrest warrant, Stendig said. Banks then placed Davis in handcuffs and drove him away before shooting him repeatedly in the back and leaving his body in a snow-covered pull off along the road only a few miles from his home.
Stendig said Banks reported that he carried out the deadly hit on behalf of a “Turkish prince” – a title fraudulently used by Serhat Gumrukcu.
Gumrukcu, whose sentencing hearing started Thursday but was then delayed until November, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Berk Eratay, a former close friend of Gumrukcu, was sentenced Thursday to a little more than nine years for his role in Gregory Davis’ killing. 
Prosecutors argued during Gumrukcu’s trial in April that he masterminded the plot because he was concerned that Gregory Davis, with whom he had been involved in a failed oil deal, could expose his fraudulent business dealings.
On Friday, the prosecutor and Ethridge’s attorney Mark Kaplan asked for a 150-month prison term for Ethridge, a former railroad conductor from Henderson, Nevada. 
“Eight years ago I made the worst decision of my life,” Ethridge said. He apologized to the Davis family for the “terror and sadness” he caused, and to his own family for not being there for them, particularly his 5-year-old daughter. 
“I sincerely hope that my actions and behaviors brought some closure to the family,” he said, with his voice breaking in sobs. 
As Melissa Davis approached the prosecutor’s table to make her statement, Ethridge turned his body toward her and listened carefully. 
Melissa Davis offered Ethridge her forgiveness, thanking him for his cooperation with investigators.
“Your choices brought harm, but your daughter can still see a father who chooses the way of truth,” she said to him. 
“I’m so sorry,” a tearful Ethridge said when she finished speaking.
The judge set hearings for November in all four cases to determine the restitution they will have to pay to the Davis family.
Reiss, near the end of Friday’s hearing, pointed out that the recurring theme in all the cases was that the four men involved had many talents and abilities, from strong computer skills and leadership qualities to disarming charisma.  
“When you have good gifts,” she said, “it’s important not to use them in the wrong way.”

Jim Pillen listens during a summit of the governors of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska with business leaders in the Sioux City area. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen on Friday rejected proposed regulatory changes he said had been pushed by a former director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission facing federal charges alleging public corruption involving two Lincoln strip clubs.
Pillen, in posts Friday morning on social media sites Facebook and X, said he would not allow a man accused of taking “bribes and sexual favors” to lift the ban on customers touching the employees at such establishments that also serve liquor. 
The language the governor targeted would have removed labeling any contact like kissing or touching of the breast, buttock or genital areas as a “disturbance” that requires automatic reporting. He also rejected the other changes proposed under the former director’s watch for this year. The regulatory process started last November and was sent to Pillen in February.
“My team caught it, stopped it from proceeding, and today I am formally rejecting this immoral, inappropriate and profoundly misguided policy change, as well as terminating all pending rule changes out of the Liquor Control Commission,” he wrote.
Ex-Liquor Commission director, strip club co-owner each plead not guilty

But the Governor’s Office, responding to questions Friday from the Examiner, clarified that Pillen does not want to shift the independently run Liquor Commission under the governor’s direct control as he did with the Nebraska State Historical Society.
The Legislature in 2024 placed governance of the state history agency under the governor after the State Auditor’s Office flagged some privately raised money it alleged was mishandled and a former director faced criminal charges.
That’s why Pillen’s Friday post alarmed some who prefer to keep the Liquor Commission, a governor-appointed board whose members serve six-year terms and must be confirmed by the Legislature. It also raised hackles among advocates for medical cannabis.
They care because members of the Liquor Commission also serve on the voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, so some worried that efforts to redesign the Liquor Commission might give the governor more control over cannabis, too.
Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple on Friday afternoon said the governor was not attempting to change the governance of either board. She said he was simply rejecting any potential rule or regulation changes proposed by the indicted former director.

“The governor’s action today does not affect any Cannabis Commission rules,” she said, adding. “We support the Liquor Control Commission remaining an independent agency.” 
Hobert “Hobie” Rupe has pleaded not guilty to seven felony charges, including three counts of honest services fraud — a charge that a public official or employee deprived the people of their honest work or services. 
The Liquor Commission suspended him in May. It replaced him starting next week with Micah Chaffee, an attorney who worked with the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee and State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the committee chair. 
The interim director told the Omaha World-Herald on Friday that the commission fully supports Pillen’s decision to reject the touching language change. Bruce Bailey, the Liquor Commission’s chair, did not immediately return a call Friday seeking comment.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — When John Thune disagrees with people, he tries to do it “in a respectful way,” he said Friday.
So what he said about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might be as close as Thune gets to a put-down.
“He’s got some very interesting views,” Thune said.
The Republican U.S. Senate majority leader from South Dakota made the comments in response to an audience member at the Black Hills Forum and Press Club. The question came from Sherry Bea Smith, who identified herself as a nurse from Nemo, a small Black Hills community.
Trump and RFK Jr. are making claims about autism. What do medical experts say?

Smith said “Americans have been placed in harm’s way” by Kennedy, the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Smith asked Thune — who voted for Kennedy’s confirmation — if he has a plan to “provide oversight and take action to ensure the health and safety of the American public.”
Thune replied that the Senate is exercising its oversight role and will continue to do so. He referenced a “fairly argumentative and explosive and combative” Senate Finance Committee hearing with Kennedy earlier this month, and said he expects more hearings like that if Kennedy takes actions that senators view as out-of-step with science.
“I think that’s where a majority of my colleagues are,” Thune said. “And I think if RFK veers off too much one way or another on that, I’m guessing he’ll be brought back into a zone that’s more consistent with that overall philosophy.”
Kennedy sparked controversy recently with his assertion that Tylenol is one potential driving factor behind autism, despite the medical community describing the link as inconclusive. Kennedy’s critics responded with concern, including for pregnant women. Medical professionals worry that if pregnant mothers avoid using Tylenol to treat fevers, they could increase their risk for miscarriage and other complications.
Thune, who has two daughters and three granddaughters, indicated he shares that concern. He said recommendations and decisions about public health should be made by “medical professionals, by people who are grounded in science, grounded in medicine, and have done the research.” Kennedy is a lawyer, not a physician or scientist.
“Especially on an issue like Tylenol,” Thune said, “that ought to be something that your doctor gives you advice about.”
Another controversial Kennedy move was his firing and replacement earlier this year of everyone on an influential vaccine advisory panel. That panel has since moved to change recommendations concerning childhood vaccines, COVID-19 immunizations and more.
Before Kennedy was appointed to the Trump administration, he was known for spreading false and misleading information about the safety of vaccines, including a repeatedly debunked claim that some vaccines lead to autism.
Thune said he’s had discussions about vaccine safety with President Donald Trump.
“The president believes in vaccines,” Thune said. “He’s made that very clear.

(Washington State Parks)The price to visit state parks in Washington will rise on Oct. 1, with a $15 hike to the annual cost of a Discover Pass.
State lawmakers approved the increase from $30 to $45 earlier this year. It marks the first time the pass’ price has gone up since they were introduced in 2011. 
Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites. 
The Discover Pass provides one year of unlimited entry to all Washington state lands managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Natural Resources.  
Under the rules going into effect Oct. 1, off-road vehicles transported to a recreation site by another vehicle don’t need to display a Discover Pass so long as the other vehicle has a valid pass and is parked on site. 
Also going into effect Oct. 1 are changes to the Lifetime Disabled Veterans Pass, allowing passholders access to lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources and Fish and Wildlife. The pass previously only granted access to State Parks lands. 
These changes were approved by the Legislature last year as part of Senate Bill 5390.
Revenue from pass sales goes to Washington State Parks, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of Natural Resources, with State Parks receiving the bulk of the money.  
State Parks says these funds are critical to supporting recreation and conservation opportunities, keeping bathrooms cleaned and trails maintained, and supporting forest health. 
Revenue from the Discover Pass and other fee-based funding accounts for about 71% of Washington State Parks’ budget for the 2025-27 biennium — up from about 65% in the last budget cycle. 
State Parks’ operating budget, like many agencies, saw cuts this year as lawmakers dealt with a budget shortfall. 
The agency’s two-year operating budget for the 2025-27 cycle is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for 2023-25. 
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget. 
With projected state revenue falling short of expectations, State Parks kept its 2026 budget asks to a minimum.
The agency’s largest request from the Legislature is $189,000 to hire a staff person to work on meeting the requirements of a settlement the agency reached with the U.S. Department of Justice last year over Americans with Disabilities Act violations. 
As part of the settlement, the state must provide the U.S. Attorney’s Office with a list of noncompliant facilities and make a timeline for bringing those facilities into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
State Parks has seven years to work on the updates and must report its progress to the federal government every six months.

(Courtesy of Lamp Rynearson) OMAHA — After more than two years of study and often controversial neighborhood meetings, developers of a planned North Omaha area business park fueled by a $90 million state grant have announced a major pivot: No longer will they pursue the purchase of residential properties for the project site.
The possibility of homeowner dislocation ignited public backlash early on. Controversy calmed over time as public officials and developers assured property owners they would not be forced out and that any move would be voluntary and compensated. 
But the development team led by the Omaha Economic Development Corp., which has been immersed this year in negotiations with residents of a preferred site, announced Friday that it is dropping the prospect of buying any homes.
Homes, urban farm stand at site of proposed Omaha business park buoyed by $90M in state funds

Instead, the team that also includes Burlington Capital and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce said it will acquire vacant and abandoned sites to carry out its goal of creating shovel-ready land to attract jobs and industrial users to one of the more disinvested areas of the state. The OEDC-led group in January 2024 was awarded the business park grant from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. Before that, the team was awarded a smaller grant to assemble a planning document.
 Multiple sites possible

George Achola of Burlington said the team is now focused on three site options. He said the end result could be one, two or even three spots.
The group has not ruled out developing a smaller chunk within the larger 160-acre tract that the team had eyed as its priority site, west of the Omaha airport and north of Carter Lake — the area in which many of the early opponents to the plan live. Any chunk would not include occupied residences, though, Achola said.
While some residents had expressed interest in voluntary relocation — and the compensation that would have accompanied it — the overriding thought was to respect the broader community’s desire for “stability and continuity,” a statement from the development team said.
“The decision reflects the voices of the community, many of whom shared a strong desire to remain in their homes,” said OEDC president and CEO Michael Maroney.
The announcement comes about nine months after the Omaha Inland Port Authority Board, which oversees the business park process, approved the release of nearly $7.4 million of the larger state grant so that the OEDC-led team could conduct pre-development research. Key to that was a deeper dive into whether the priority site was viable and that the developer could amass enough private property to make it work.
Garry Clark, executive director of the Omaha Inland Port Authority, commended the development team for “listening deeply and responding with integrity.”

“Prioritizing underutilized land not only respects the wishes of our residents, it also opens new pathways for innovation and investment,” Clark said. “It’s a thoughtful recalibration that keeps people at the center while driving forward the transformative potential of the Airport Business Park.” 
Melissa Youngblood, who is on the port authority’s Community Advisory Board, said she doesn’t have a personal home in the priority site but grew up with some who do. She said many residents with deep roots there did not believe monetary compensation would be enough to start over in similar circumstances elsewhere in Omaha. 
Plus, she said, many wondered why the developers didn’t set their sights on vacant or run down areas where people did not live. 
In some cases, Youngblood said, “They would be taking away not just somebody’s home but their whole life.”
 Developers ‘relieved’

The business park project is an anchor of the port authority district that was formed to nurture growth across about 3,000 acres of the North Omaha area near Eppley Airfield, which has seen disproportionately higher rates of unemployment and disinvestment than most parts of the state.

State law recently changed to enlarge the area in which the business park could be developed, dropping an earlier requirement that the park be located within two miles of the airport and instead allowing it to be within the broader boundaries of Omaha’s inland port authority district. That opens up different opportunities and an area that stretches as far west as North 30th Street and Ames Avenue.
Achola declined to comment on the current frontrunner sites or possibilities, saying real estate prices could jump.
Earlier, a top site the OEDC team identified near 16th and Locust Streets was found to require costly environmental cleanup, but a port authority official said that area had not been ruled out.
The $90 million set aside for the business park was part of the Economic Recovery Act approved by the Legislature in 2022 and updated in 2023, built originally off of federal pandemic recovery funds. The OEDC-Burlington-Chamber team won the grant, saying it planned to use the funds to prepare a shovel-ready site and to market the area to businesses that would build a job-producing industrial hub.
The port authority board was established after the Economic Recovery Act laid out parameters for the business park. 
Achola said the goal is still to have a site or sites pinpointed later this year and to see construction begin the early part of next year. He said chamber officials, meanwhile, continue to seek potential tenants for the park.
“It’s never a straight linear line,” Achola said of developing real estate projects in populated parts of a city. “We’re relieved things are starting to take more shape.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — A trial that could determine whether state-imposed abortion restrictions can remain in Kansas began Friday with testimony from the abortion providers behind the challenge.
Traci Lynn Nauser, an OB-GYN who owns a clinic in Overland Park, told a small but full courtroom about the burdens of state legislation requiring abortion providers like herself to comply with a litany of anti-abortion rules.
The bench trial in Johnson County District Court examines the Kansas Women’s Right to Know Act, which was passed in 1997 and modified several times by the Kansas Legislature over the years.
Nauser said many of the state’s requirements broke down trust from the beginning of her patient interactions. Iman Alsaden, the chief medical officer for Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified that the state’s restrictions undermined informed consent and relationships with patients.
The trial’s outcome could impact how abortion providers and lawmakers do business. Attorneys for the state dissected Alsaden’s and Nauser’s expertise on medication abortions, abortion reversals and the experiences of patients.
The Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy organization, brought the lawsuit in 2023 on behalf of Nauser, her practice and Planned Parenthood, challenging the 1997 law and its amendments. The lawsuit came nearly a year after Kansas voters in 2022 rejected an attempt to eliminate the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, which the Kansas Supreme Court established in a 2019 ruling on a case brought by Nauser and Herbert Hodes, Nauser’s father.
That vote made Kansas one of the few states in the region to cement abortion rights, but Republican lawmakers found ways through additions to the Women’s Right to Know Act in 2024 to couch those rights with new mandates for abortion providers.
Among them, lawmakers created a requirement that physicians must tell patients at least five times that medication abortions can be reversed, a procedure Nauser has never performed, calling it “experimental,” unproven and potentially dangerous for patients. It also created the “reason mandate,” which requires physicians to ask patients to disclose the most important factor in deciding to obtain an abortion. Some reasons given ask whether the patient has too many children already or if the patient cannot provide for the child.
The center asked a judge in 2024 to add the new laws to its lawsuit, which was allowed, and in October 2023, Judge K. Christopher Jayaram granted a temporary injunction, halting the implementation of those laws
“We are now able to get patients the care they need when they need it,” Alsaden said.
The lawsuit also challenges requirements that providers disclose state-sanctioned anti-abortion language, including the false claims that abortion poses a risk to future pregnancies and increases the risk of breast cancer. Physicians have to present the information in a specific typeface, font size and color. And patients have to wait 30 minutes after meeting with their provider before they can receive abortion care.
Nauser said during testimony Friday the state’s requirements were “the antithesis of informed consent.” She said the state’s materials contained misinformation, burdened the patient-physician relationship, required patients to jump through hoops and necessitated what Nauser described as long, confusing conversations.
She said she is unaware of any patient of hers that did not get an abortion because of the state’s mandates.
Alice Wang, attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, asked Nauser if she had ever come across a patient who regretted getting an abortion.
Nauser said patients have mixed feelings, including grief or sadness, but not regret. Wang asked Nauser to give an example.
Nauser began to cry.
She was one of those patients, she said.
Roughly 25 years ago, Nauser said, she became pregnant with quadruplets after struggling with infertility. Nauser and her husband decided to abort two of the fetuses with a procedure in Detroit to increase the likelihood of survival for the remaining two. At 20 weeks, pregnancy complications arose. One of the remaining fetuses was stillborn, and the other was born alive but didn’t survive. She said she basically had four abortions in one pregnancy.
The lead attorney for the state, Lincoln Wilson, of the conservative Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, pointed out while cross-examining Nauser that around one-third of patients don’t schedule a follow-up appointment following an abortion, and of the two-thirds who do, they frequently don’t show up, according to previously disclosed information from Nauser.
Nauser inherited her medical practice and clinic, Center for Women’s Health, from her father, who is a retired OB-GYN and abortion provider. Her first memory was her father performing surgery on a teddy bear, she said. Later, she said she remembered pickets outside her family home on Sundays, which was how she learned her father performed abortions.
During Wang’s examination of Nauser, Wilson repeatedly interrupted with objections, which Jayaram had little patience for.
Teresa Woody, an attorney on the case in her capacity as a private practitioner rather than in her role as litigation director for the advocacy organization Kansas Appleseed, said in an interview with Kansas Reflector that she believes the plaintiffs have very sound grounds in the trial. She said the temporary injunction is a good indicator for their arguments.
“None of us can read the future, but based on those things and the case law that is there now, we feel confident that these requirements and restrictions are unconstitutional,” Woody said.
Kansas solicitor general Anthony Powell, a former state representative and appeals court judge, is overseeing the team of attorneys for the state.
The trial is scheduled to continue with witness examination Monday and Tuesday, which will be followed by a nearly monthlong pause until it picks up again Oct. 14.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250926_nauserwang-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-26 19:57:15.306263

School district officials and politicians spoke out Friday about the arrest of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, with some calling for empathy and others appalled that someone with “a prior weapons charge and an active deportation order” was placed in charge of Iowa’s largest school district.
Initially, online information from ICE indicated Roberts had been placed in the Pottawattamie County Jail after his arrest. Later on Friday, however, Roberts’ name and information were no longer searchable on the ICE locator website.

According to a press release from ICE, Roberts was in possession of a handgun, a hunting knife and $3,000 in cash when he was detained. Agents had approached Roberts in his vehicle during a “targeted enforcement operation,” the release stated, after which he allegedly sped off. Officers later found his car abandoned, the agency stated.
The Iowa State Patrol assisted ICE in locating the vehicle after Roberts allegedly drove off, according to a release from the Iowa Department of Public Safety. The release stated that Roberts was in the custody of “immigration authorities.”
In its press release, ICE said Roberts has “existing weapon possession charges” from February 2020, which the Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to independently verify. Roberts did plead guilty to unlawful possession of a loaded firearm in a vehicle after a November 2021 offense, a fifth-degree penalty, according to court records from Erie, Pa.
Roberts was also given what ICE called a “final order of removal by an immigration judge” in May 2024  after coming to the United States in 1999 on a student visa.
“This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson in the agency’s press release. “This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats. How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”
Mason Mauro, deputy communications director for the office of the governor of Iowa, said Gov. Kim Reynolds was “made aware” Roberts had been arrested, and added that she was “in contact with the Iowa Department of Public Safety and federal authorities.”
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said in a social media statement he stands with law enforcement, adding that Friday’s incident emphasizes the need to “fix our broken immigration system.” Nunn’s office has opened more than 800 cases since 2023 to “help Iowans navigate immigration issues,” he said online, and that work will continue.
“An individual with a prior weapons charge and an active deportation order should never have been placed in this position of public trust,” Nunn said in an online statement.
The school district had little information to share at a Friday afternoon press conference, with school board president Jackie Norris saying “there is much we do not know.” She acknowledged that new information has come to light in the wake of Roberts’ arrest, but added that the district has not been able to independently verify that information.
The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners granted Roberts a license to serve in Iowa as a superintendent in July 2023 when he started in his job at Des Moines Public Schools.
“It seems fitting to take a page out of Dr. Roberts’s book and ask the community to engage in radical empathy as we work through the situation together,” Norris said Friday. “Radical empathy is the recognition that we can disagree and still empathize with each other. The respect of others’ humanity — this concept will be essential as we wait to learn more.”

 Comentario invitado escrito por 

 Trena Turner
 Trena Turner sirvió en la Comisión de Redistribución de Distritos de Ciudadanos de California en 2020. Es ministra ordenada y pastora ejecutiva de la Iglesia Victory In Praise en Stockton. 


Como ex-comisionado de redistribución de distritos de California, he presenciado de primera mano el proceso cuidadoso, deliberado y transparente que definió nuestras divisiones en el Congreso para reflejar la realidad de nuestro estado. El trabajo no fue fácil, pero fue honorable y salvaguardó el principio de que cada comunidad merece una representación justa.
 Es por eso que me siento alarmado y profundamente decepcionado por la forma en que las conversaciones en torno a la Proposición 50 , la medida de redistribución de distritos de mitad de ciclo de California, a menudo se han reducido a una única pregunta superficial: “¿Cuánto costará?”.
 Sí, estas elecciones especiales tienen un costo financiero . Pero si las analizamos solo en términos de dólares y centavos, ignoramos los riesgos mayores. Se estima que 3.4 millones de californianos podrían perder su cobertura médica debido a los recortes a Medicaid , y otros 3.1 millones de personas —niños, veteranos y familias— se enfrentan a la pérdida de la asistencia nutricional vital a través del SNAP.
 Este momento tendrá consecuencias mensurables que transformarán la salud y la estabilidad de nuestro estado, al tiempo que erosionarán constantemente los cimientos de nuestra democracia.
No podemos ignorar la realidad de que la reestructuración de los mapas de este año en Texas y otros estados , a instancias del presidente Trump, ha sido ampliamente cuestionada como manipulación racial de los distritos electorales. Esto continúa un modelo generacional en muchos estados, donde se trazan límites para debilitar las voces de las personas negras, morenas, inmigrantes y de la clase trabajadora, para que los políticos puedan elegir a sus votantes.
 La Constitución es clara: la función del Congreso es promulgar leyes y actuar como contrapeso del poder ejecutivo. Sin embargo, el Congreso, liderado por los republicanos, no ha cumplido esa función. En lugar de actuar como garante, el Congreso ha eludido su responsabilidad y se ha convertido en un simple sello de aprobación para los caprichos inconstitucionales del presidente.
 La responsabilidad de frenar este abuso de poder recae ahora en los estados y en la propia ciudadanía. Por eso, California debe hacer todo lo posible para contrarrestarlo. La redistribución de distritos electorales a mitad de mandato es una necesidad moral. Necesitamos aprobar la Proposición 50 y hacer todo lo posible para mantener la línea.
 El verdadero costo de la inacción se hace evidente cuando los niños pasan hambre porque sus comunidades son apartadas del poder político y sus necesidades son ignoradas.
 El costo real se hace evidente cuando las familias trabajadoras son silenciadas, mientras los donantes ricos y los políticos arraigados redibujan los mapas para protegerse.
 El costo real aparece cuando generaciones de lucha por una representación justa son borradas de un plumazo que divide barrios y disuelve comunidades de interés.
 Y, en última instancia, el mayor costo lo asume nuestra propia democracia. Si nos negamos a actuar por temor al costo de unas elecciones especiales, somos cómplices de pagar un precio mucho mayor en dignidad humana y erosión democrática.
 Ser comisionado de redistribución de distritos significó escuchar a miles de californianos: padres, trabajadores agrícolas, empresarios, pastores, estudiantes, personas mayores y más. Compartieron historias sobre quiénes son y cómo funcionan sus comunidades, desde el Valle Central hasta la costa, desde las ciudades hasta los pueblos rurales.
 Honramos la Ley de Derecho al Voto estatal , respetamos a las comunidades de interés y elaboramos mapas públicos para que todos los vieran. Fue la democracia en acción. Fueron los californianos quienes demostraron que la redistribución de distritos independiente y transparente no solo es posible, sino necesaria.
 Ahora, frente a la manipulación racial deliberada de los distritos electorales en otros estados y a los excesos sin control del ejecutivo en su país , California debe responder con la misma determinación.
 La democracia nunca es gratuita. A cada generación se le pide que invierta en su supervivencia. Pero la pregunta que nos ocupa no es si la redistribución de distritos electorales a mitad de mandato es costosa. La pregunta es si seguiremos permitiendo el coste descontrolado de leyes inhumanas, abusos inconstitucionales y órdenes ejecutivas de gran alcance que afectan a los californianos comunes.
 Hemos visto a esta administración presidencial desmantelar los programas de DEI y enviar a la Guardia Nacional a nuestras ciudades bajo falsas acusaciones de “crimen desenfrenado”, mientras recorta los mismos programas que lo redujeron . Ha atacado y criminalizado a personas vulnerables bajo el pretexto de la “seguridad pública”.
 Es una falta de visión que los californianos solo piensen en California en este momento. Quedarse de brazos cruzados y permitir más de lo mismo es rendirse al autoritarismo a cámara lenta. Las garantías que una vez creímos que nos protegerían simplemente no se sostienen.

El 4 de noviembre, los votantes de California decidirán si el estado debe adoptar temporalmente un nuevo mapa electoral demócrata para combatir iniciativas similares en estados republicanos, o si opta por retirarse. A continuación, un excomisionado de redistribución de distritos afirma que la Proposición 50 no es el modelo de gobierno responsable que los californianos merecen. La opinión contraria: Otro excomisionado de redistribución de distritos argumenta que es una falta de visión que los californianos solo piensen en California en este momento.

 Comentario invitado escrito por 

 Juana Raya
 Jeanne Raya dirige una agencia de seguros y reside en San Gabriel. Fue presidenta de la primera comisión independiente de redistribución de distritos de California. 


 En 2008, la Ley de Votantes Primero creó la Comisión Ciudadana de Redistribución de Distritos de California, un organismo independiente integrado por personas que reflejaban la diversidad del estado. Grupos de buen gobierno impulsaron la iniciativa electoral, buscando asegurar que los votantes fueran, como lo indicaba el nombre de la ley, priorizados. Dos años después, formé parte de la primera comisión.
La aprobación por parte de los votantes de una comisión independiente puso fin de manera efectiva a la manipulación partidista que caracterizó la redistribución de distritos en California durante décadas.
Los miembros de la comisión dedicaron casi un año a elaborar nuevos mapas , lo que permitió a los ciudadanos acceder a más de 100 reuniones públicas y a diferentes formas de presentar comentarios por escrito. Los votantes pudieron describir sus comunidades, y determinar su infraestructura y su economía. Esto proporcionó a la comisión una visión general de California y ayudó a crear distritos que ofrecían a los votantes una oportunidad justa de elegir representantes responsables.
 La comisión de California se considera ahora el estándar de oro para la redistribución de distritos en Estados Unidos, libre de intereses partidistas y llevada a cabo totalmente a la vista del público.
 Ojalá Texas aprendiera de California. Allí, los legisladores adoptaron nuevos mapas en agosto en un intento de manipular las elecciones de 2026 a favor de los republicanos, a instancias del presidente Donald Trump . Sus acciones representan las motivaciones más viles de políticos tan temerosos de perder el poder que solo se les ocurre hacer trampa.
 Su determinación de manipular las posibilidades del Congreso impulsó al gobernador Gavin Newsom a implementar una redistribución de distritos electorales a mitad de ciclo electoral en California para elegir a más demócratas. Ahora está en manos de los votantes en una elección especial el 4 de noviembre. La Proposición 50 reemplazaría los mapas trazados por la comisión independiente del estado con distritos trazados por los legisladores únicamente para obtener o proteger escaños demócratas. Y esa protección se extenderá a lo largo de tres ciclos electorales.
 No se trata precisamente de un cambio temporal.
Como demócrata registrado, celebraría el reemplazo de los miembros del Congreso que han olvidado su juramento de servir a sus electores y proteger la Constitución. Pero no puede ser a costo de la Constitución de California, ni de sus votantes que exigieron una redistribución de distritos justa e imparcial.
 Newsom afirmó que la acción de los republicanos texanos justifica un ataque de represalia . Pero a diario presenciamos el caos y la desconfianza que genera la política de venganza en Washington. Ese no es el modelo de gobierno responsable que merecen los californianos. Los californianos tampoco quieren gastar millones de dólares de los contribuyentes en la apuesta de que diferentes distritos congresionales producirán el cambio deseado, mientras que los problemas reales siguen sin resolverse.
 Nadie conoce la cantidad mágica de escaños demócratas necesarios para ganar esta guerra electoral, especialmente a medida que más estados republicanos se suman a la contienda, además de Texas. ¿Está dispuesto el gobernador a arriesgarse a perder a los titulares en distritos californianos más competitivos? ¿Aceptará el fracaso si los demócratas se quedan cortos a nivel nacional?
 Este no es un momento sin precedentes. Llevamos décadas viendo cómo la manipulación partidista de los distritos electorales suprime la capacidad de decisión de los votantes, socavando la confianza y alimentando el cinismo. Sabemos que, una vez que reciben el poder, los políticos lucharán por conservarlo con la confianza de que una declaración de crisis es la única excusa que necesitan.
 Newsom debería buscar una respuesta diferente a la guerra de redistribución de distritos.
El representante Kevin Kiley, por ejemplo, propuso una legislación para prohibir la redistribución de distritos a mediados de década en todo el país . No sé qué llevó a Kiley, republicano del condado de Placer, a este punto. Quizás fue instinto de supervivencia ante la amenaza de perder su escaño . Pero considerar una solución nacional a un problema nacional sería una iniciativa bienvenida.
 Newsom afirma que los demócratas pueden recuperar el Congreso si se les da al pueblo estadounidense una oportunidad justa, voz y opciones. En California, la gente ya tiene esa oportunidad, y es la comisión independiente de redistribución de distritos.
 Los californianos pueden enviar un mensaje claro a Newsom y a los líderes legislativos el 4 de noviembre para que respeten la voluntad del pueblo y no sacrifiquen la comisión independiente de redistribución de distritos, ni los recursos financieros limitados del estado, por ganancias políticas a corto plazo.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090625-CA-GOP-OC-JAH-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 19:57:15.306263

Lauren Boebert speaks to supporters during an election night watch party on Nov. 5, 2024 in Windsor, Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican, is one of just four Republicans in Congress supporting efforts to force a floor vote on releasing U.S. Department of Justice case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
Legislators leading the effort have said a petition that would force a vote on a resolution requiring the full release of the Epstein case files has enough signatures to pass, but allies of President Donald Trump continue to oppose a floor vote on the issue.

The resolution, led by U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, was introduced before Congress went into recess, but House Speaker Mike Johnson let the members go early to avoid a vote on the resolution. 
Boebert, the only Colorado Republican to sign the petition, has long sought an aggressive Epstein investigation and called for a special counsel to take the case this summer. The four Republicans who signed the discharge petition are Boebert, Massie, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.  
All four Colorado Democrats in the House — U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood — signed the petition.
The government’s investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse has dogged and splintered House Republicans since July, when Trump’s administration declared it would not share any further information on the powerful and well-connected financier, with whom Trump was friends. Epstein died in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. 
Boebert’s office did not respond to a Newsline request for comment.

Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, in an opinion letter dated Thursday, recommended Hoskins reject the petition because the law describing the form says the petition must refer to “laws” passed by the General Assembly.
In the opinion letter, which has not yet been published on the attorney general’s website, Hanaway wrote: “A bill passed by the Missouri House of Representatives and Senate does not become ‘a law’ until it is either ‘approved by the governor’ or until the bill is not ‘returned by the governor within the time limits prescribed by this section.’” 
The redistricting plan, she wrote, “has not been signed by Governor Kehoe.”
In a statement to The Independent, Hanaway’s office said proponents should have waited.
“State law only allows a referendum on measures that have been enacted into law,” the statement provided by spokeswoman Abigail Bergmann read. “The referendum petition was thus premature.”
The redistricting plan seeks to flip the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, to Republicans. President Donald Trump began pushing for Missouri to redistrict in late July.
Richard von Glahn, leading the committee People Not Politicians in its quest to put the plan on a ballot, immediately called shenanigans and his attorney, Chuck Hatfield, wrote a letter demanding a revision.
“It is a matter of public record that the governor has announced his assent to the bill and intends to sign it on Sunday of this week,” Hatfield wrote in a footnote to his legal analysis. “Delaying review of the referendum forms on that basis is simply silly. Nothing allows you to do so.”
To be successful, a referendum petition must have signatures equal to 5% of the vote for governor in six of the state’s eight congressional districts. The petitions must be submitted within 90 days of the adjournment of the legislative session that passed the new law.
Lawmakers concluded the special session on Sept. 12, giving von Glahn’s group until Dec. 11 to submit the signatures.
“People Not Politicians has continued to face obstinance from politicians who refuse to perform their administrative duties and adhere to legal deadlines around processing the legally submitted referendum petition,” a news release from the campaign stated. “The group continues to gather signatures to put the issue before Missouri voters.”
If the decision is not reversed, the issue will go to the courts, von Glahn said.
“We are confident the courts will side with Missourians constitutional right to a referendum, as they always have,” he said in the news release.
In his letter challenging Hanaway’s legal analysis, Hatfield wrote that her constitutional references are inaccurate and she missed important sections that control the referendum process.
“Your letter ignores (the referendum clause), which guarantees to the people the ‘power to approve or reject by referendum any act of the general assembly,’” Hatfield wrote. “That is exactly what Mr. von Glahn seeks to do and the constitution is extremely clear.” 
In 2022, the Missouri Supreme Court found two laws that impeded the referendum process were unconstitutional. In that decision, the court found that signatures gathered before the ballot language for the petition had been written were valid.
In that case, administrative delays by the attorney general and the secretary of state were found to be improper barriers when opponents of a law banning abortions attempted an initiative in 2019.
“This is the same stuff we went through on the abortion case,” Hatfield said, “and the courts of appeals told them you can’t do that.”

(iStock photo/ Getty Images Plus)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Friday she has joined attorneys general from 22 states in urging the Trump administration to oppose environmental policy from the European Union. 
The letter points to two elements of the European Union’s corporate sustainability directive and says they impose “sweeping” requirements tied to diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental, social, and governance practices, also known as DEI and ESG, that would place “severe burdens” on American businesses. 
Led by Florida and West Virginia attorneys general, the letter says the reporting requirements would cost American companies financially, create disincentives for American companies that use or invest in fossil fuels, “and worse, it creates potential liability for companies who do not wish to partake in this climate radicalism.” 
Bird, in a news release about the letter said the EU directives would be “bad for Iowa” and for the country. 
“I’m thankful we can bring this very urgent concern to the Trump Administration and know they have our country’s best economic interests at heart,” Bird said in the release. “The EU’s radical green agenda attempts to gut our energy industry and all the industries that rely on them, including agriculture, trucking, and manufacturing.”
The European Union is set to implement the “Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive” and the “Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive” both of which require companies that do a certain amount of business in the EU or globally to file reports on their environmental and social impacts. 
The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, according to the EU, requires companies to publish reports detailing the “social and environmental risks they face, and on how their activities impact people and  the environment.” 
“This helps investors, civil society organisations, consumers and other stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability performance of companies, as part of the European green deal,” the EU stated on its website explaining the directive. 
The letter from the Republican attorneys general says these reports would require an “inordinate amount of time and expense” to create and would put “conflicting pressure” on companies that have changed their environmental, social, and governance practices “in response to (President Donald Trump’s) electoral landslide.” 
The letter says these reports would also make companies susceptible to “green-washing lawsuits.” 
According to the EU the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive’s core elements are “identifying and addressing potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts” from business operations, subsidiaries and through the value chain. This directive also requires companies to adopt a climate mitigation strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 2050 climate neutrality objective. 
The letter calls this directive “a demand that ESG and DEI be incorporated into companies.” The letter also objects to the “aggressive” enforcement mechanisms of the “unconstitutional and immoral requirements.”
The attorneys general end the letter asking Trump to sdirect U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to oppose the EU’s directives.

The highly pathogenic form of bird flu is contagious and may cause high mortality in poultry and wild birds. 
“Commercial turkey facilities in the northern U.S. and here in Utah have been the most impacted by HPAI this fall. With migratory bird season just beginning, we may see a greater impact as the season progresses,” State Veterinarian Amanda Price said in a statement, urging poultry producers to maintain strong biosecurity measures. 
The reported case involved a single round of birds from a facility in Sanpete County. The birds on that site will be “depopulated to prevent further spread,” the department of agriculture said in a news release. 
The state agency is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the response to the outbreak and will conduct additional surveillance and testing in neighboring areas.

“The loss of this flock is a significant hardship for the producer and their community,” Utah Department of Agriculture and Food Commissioner Kelly Pehrson said in the release.
However, he said the case “is not expected to cause a notable impact on the availability of turkeys in Utah or across the country leading up to Thanksgiving.”
“Consumers should feel confident that turkey and poultry products remain safe and readily available,” Pehrson said.
While the virus is a serious disease for birds, it currently doesn’t present an immediate risk to public health, the department said. 
Domestic flocks can get the disease from direct contact with wild birds, contaminated equipment or people moving between flocks. Signs of highly pathogenic avian influenza include frequent death in flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption and lack of coordination in birds. 
“Owners of birds experiencing any of these signs should immediately contact the State Veterinarian’s Office at statevet@utah.gov,” the release advised. Resources to protect flocks can also be found on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website.

Martin Heinrich on Sept. 26, 2025 in Las Cruces discussed the impact the loss of Affordable Care Act health insurance rebates would have on NM. (Leah Romero for Source NM)As a possible federal government shutdown looms, so does the chance that thousands of New Mexicans will see significant increases to their health insurance premiums.
The health insurance credits have become a sticking point in negotiations over a spending bill Congress needs to pass to avoid a government shut-down at the end of the month.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) spoke in Las Cruces Friday alongside representatives of BeWell, the state’s health insurance marketplace; La Clinica de Familia, a private, federally qualified health center; and New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, a social justice advocacy organization.
Heinrich explained that if passed, the GOP-led government funding bill will mean the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits will expire at the end of the plan year, and people insured under the ACA will see their monthly insurance premiums increase between $300 and $500.
Democratic governors rally Congressional Republicans to extend health care tax credits

“I don’t know about you, but after the last few years of increased costs, when you think about how inflation and tariffs have impacted everything from beef to coffee to what you buy at the hardware store, I don’t know New Mexicans who can afford another $300 or $400 a month in their health care premiums,” Heinrich said during the news conference. “This is going to be absolutely dire for the state of New Mexico… In addition, the president has basically directed his leadership in the Congress not to negotiate.” 
Victoria Hernandez, outreach and eligibility specialist for BeWell, explained that BeWell currently provides assistance to more than 75,000 New Mexicans to pay monthly premiums — about double the enrollment from several years before. With premiums increasing, “We’re going to have our families, our individuals, our fellow New Mexicans making some tough decisions,” she said. “Do I pay for health care, do I pay for rent, do I pay utility bills and my car payment?
NM Center on Law and Poverty Policy Director Arika Sánchez explained that the state has made significant progress in reducing the number of uninsured residents over the last decade – from 22% in 2013 to 12% in 2023.
“With nearly 810,000 New Mexicans currently accessing Medicaid and enrollment of about 75,000 on BeWell, the impact of coverage losses will be devastating, especially for our rural communities, low-wage workers, caregivers, hospitals and clinics,” Sanchez said. “And we know that when people don’t have health insurance, they’re forced to skip checkups and testing and the care they need. They wait until things get really bad before going to the doctor, and they often end up in the emergency room where services are the most expensive.”
She added that six to eight hospitals will be at risk for closing their doors within the next two years, if assistance is discontinued.
John Andazola, chief medical officer for La Clinica de Familia, said while his clinic will continue seeing patients regardless of their ability to pay, the loss of assistance will mean patients may not be able to pay for tests, X-rays, vaccines and other preventative care. It also could mean that the clinic will have to reduce its staff, cut services or close completely.
“Health care costs will rise due to delayed care, but also access to basic services will diminish if we are forced to reduce programs or worse, cut care and again, close our doors,” he said. “These cuts will not only threaten the physical health of our patients, it’ll threaten our patients’ financial stability.”
The New Mexico Legislature is slated to convene for a special session beginning next week, where health care coverage is included in the agenda. Fernandez said BeWell will be asking for  additional funds to support people in paying their increased premiums. 
“Our concern is that the state can’t sustain this forever,” she said. 
Heinrich added that while he appreciates the state’s willingness to step up and fill the need left by the federal government, it doesn’t have the financial capability to take on the large scale of need by New Mexicans.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heinrich-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118
,DC,2025-09-26 22:11:56+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Supreme Court allows Trump to cancel $4B in foreign aid already approved by Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-allows-trump-cancel-4b-foreign-aid-already-approved-congress,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday reaffirmed its ruling from earlier this month that the Trump administration can withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, though the order notes the decision “should not be read as a final determination on the merits” of the case.White House budget director Russ Vought wrote on social media shortly after the order from the emergency docket was released that it represented a “Major victory.”The new nine-page order doesn’t provide any additional details about why a majority of the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to rescind the funding without congressional approval. But it does include a dissent written by Justice Elena Kagan that was supported by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, highlighting the stakes in the case. “This emergency application raises novel issues fundamental to the relationship between the President and Congress,” Kagan wrote. “It arises from the refusal of the President and his officers to obligate and spend billions of dollars that Congress appropriated for foreign aid.”The case, she wrote, brings up an issue the Supreme Court has never addressed.“Deciding the question presented thus requires the Court to work in uncharted territory,” Kagan wrote. “And, to repeat, the stakes are high: At issue is the allocation of power between the Executive and Congress over the expenditure of public monies.”Kagan noted that since the case came to the justices on the emergency docket, they had less than three weeks to consider it. “In a few weeks’ time—when we turn to our regular docket—we will decide cases of far less import with far more process and reflection,” Kagan wrote.She goes on to disagree with the majority of the justices, saying the Supreme Court “should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves.”Trump administration actions found illegal by watchdogThe ruling the Supreme Court posted Friday is similar to the one it released in mid-September when Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. overturned a district court ruling that would have required the Trump administration to spend the money. The case now largely revolves around whether the White House budget office has the authority to send Congress a rescissions request during the last 45 days of the fiscal year, a maneuver the Government Accountability Office has called illegal. When the White House asks Congress to cancel previously approved spending through a rescission, lawmakers are supposed to have 45 days to approve, modify, or ignore the request. But Vought believes that any rescissions request sent up during those 45 days allows the White House to unilaterally cancel the funding, regardless of whether lawmakers agree or not. The Trump administration asked lawmakers to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs this summer through a rescissions request.Lawmakers mostly approved that proposal after preserving full funding for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.The White House budget office then sent lawmakers a second rescissions request in late August, proposing they claw back billions of additional foreign aid dollars. Neither the House nor the Senate has yet to vote on that proposal. But the Supreme Court’s ruling allows the White House budget office to withhold the funding anyway. Democratic members of Congress reactHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., issued a joint statement after the court’s ruling calling on their GOP colleagues to protect the institution’s power over spending decisions. “Congress can—and absolutely should—promptly reject President Trump and Russ Vought’s illegal effort to do an end run around the people’s elected representatives by passing a bill like the one we introduced last week,” they wrote. “Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse, rather than allow a president and an unelected bureaucrat who do not respect Congress or the Constitution to continue attacking our power to fight for the people back home that we represent.”",,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118

(U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Jeanette Mullinax/Released)The U.S. Department of Defense has quietly extended the timeline to clean up “forever chemicals” at more than 100 military sites around the country, including Montana’s largest military outpost. 
Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls is among 140 military sites with a delayed investigations and remediation timeline for chemicals known as PFAS — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — which can take thousands of years to break down and can be present in water, soil and even food. 
The chemicals are found in waterproofing material, food packaging and in fire-fighting foam. The last source, used in emergency response training at airports and military bases, makes the Department of Defense one of the most prolific users of the chemicals. 
Studies have linked exposure to the chemicals with increased risks of cancer, immune disorders, problems with child development, and other adverse health effects, according to an EPA health advisory.
A Government Accountability Office figure showing the cleanup status of current and former DOD military installations, as of June 30, 2024.
The Defense Department has identified more than 700 military installations where PFAS was used or may have been released. Since 2017, the Department has spent $2.6 billion investigating and cleaning up the substances, according to a recent report to Congress. 
A spokesperson for Malmstrom could not immediately address Friday the extent of the cleanup that’s needed at the base. He estimated the population at the base to be from 4,000 to 5,000 people based on residential units and dorms.
The delays to cleanup timelines were first reported by the New York Times on Tuesday. The Times cross-checked a list of contaminated sites, only publicly released by the Pentagon in recent weeks, with a timetable released in December 2024, in the final days of the Biden administration. Roughly 140 sites have listed dates to complete preparatory work and begin cleanup pushed back several years. 
The Daily Montanan’s analysis of a progress report from Sept. 30, 2024, found that Malmstrom was slated to have its remedial investigation and feasibility study completed by September 2026. That date has now shifted to June 2032, according to the departments’s new progress report.
Estimated dates for two U.S. Army locations — Helena’s Fort William Henry Harrison and Helena Aviation Readiness Center — to investigate and complete feasibility studies for cleanup have not changed, with investigation and feasibility studies estimated to end in March of 2026 and September of 2028 respectively.
Nolan Lister, a spokesperson for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, said work on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process at Malmstrom is currently in the remedial investigation phase, and confirmed that the process has been extended for five more years, a decision that is “supported by DEQ.”
Lister said that the  report is expected to be submitted to DEQ in Spring  2026, and that data will then be incorporated into a feasibility study to determine the best actions for remediation. 
While no clean-up has yet been completed at the base, Lister said “best management practices” have been implemented to reduce PFAS in stormwater discharges and a “sundown” of aqueous film-forming foam in fire suppression systems. Fire and emergency vehicles are also in the process of switching to a fluorine-free foam, Lister added. 
“The Air Force has contracts in place to properly dispose of all (aqueous film-forming foam) collected from hangars and vehicles by end of 2025,” Lister wrote in an email. “In addition, at known (foam) release sites, any construction projects are required to coordinate with remedial project managers, and PFAS-contaminated soil is managed to minimize runoff. Any PFAS-impacted groundwater from dewatering is required to be treated or disposed appropriately as well.”
The New York Times reported that while the delays in site-specific cleanup operations were announced quietly, it comes amid debates about the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which in its current form would undo a ban on purchasing and using firefighting foam made with PFAS and shrink funding for toxic site cleanups. 
However, the NDAA also contains provisions to “accelerate remediation” of PFAS-contaminated sites, and provides for the department to create a publicly available online dashboard to track response efforts at each military installation. 
According to a 2025 Government Accountability Office report to congress on PFAS cleanup, the Department of Defense, referred to by the Trump administration as the “Department of War,” says that costs for investigation and cleanup have skyrocketed. 
“The department’s estimated future PFAS investigation costs more than tripled since 2022, while estimates for future pFAS cleanup costs have increased 15-fold,” the report states.
Lister, with Montana DEQ, said the department is “not aware of any funding delays regarding our PFAS investigations at Malmstrom or the Great Falls National Guard site,” but that if funds were shifted away from remediation efforts it could “slow progress along the CECRLA path, resulting in additional time passing before implementation of cleanup.”
“The Department of War has not communicated any potential funding delay,” Lister said. 
A Department of Defense PFAS progress update from March, 2025.
At the Montana Air National Guard Base in Great Falls, also listed on the DOD list of contaminated sites, remedial investigation work was expected to begin in September. Lister said that the remedial investigation is planned and “will be sequenced for funding alongside other ANG and Air Force enterprise-wide locations.”
The state’s cleanup efforts are funded through the Defense and State Memorandum of Agreement program on a two-year funding cycle. 
“DEQ is currently working through the process of generating work plans known as Joint Execution Plans with our federal partners for work that will be conducted 2027 to 2032,” Lister added.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 released new drinking water standards for certain PFAS compounds. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality says they are still reviewing the new information and will look to adopt the standards into rule during a two-year process. 
According to EPA’s new recently released standards, public water supplies have three years to meet the PFAS sampling requirements and then two additional years to implement a remedy if the water quality results exceed the new standards.
The Department of Environmental Quality has sampled public water systems in Montana for PFAS contamination in recent years. Only one location, in Kalispell, was found to exceed EPA advisory levels.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/30564504860_7b53442c15_k-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)There are many closed doors at the state Capitol in Olympia. 
Sometimes it’s understandable. Confidentiality can be necessary in politics and policymaking. There are also meetings and conversations among public officials where it is not. Where the doors should remain open.
Meetings we’ve pressed for information about and access to in recent days provide examples of this latter category. 
One was on nuclear energy. The other Gov. Bob Ferguson called with fellow statewide elected officials. 
Both are reminders of the reflexive lack of transparency and inclination to tightly control the flow of information, that are now deeply ingrained in today’s politics and reflected frequently in Ferguson’s administration.
Exhibit 1
On Thursday and Friday this week, the National Governors Association convened a two-day Nuclear Energy Policy Retreat in the Washington state Capitol building. The association’s description of the program indicated the meetings would conclude “with a state strategic plan to pursue their Governor designated objectives” around nuclear policy.
There were panels on nuclear waste and the economics of nuclear power, among other topics. Representatives from the nuclear industry, utilities, companies like Amazon and Microsoft (which both have an interest in nuclear power for their data centers), and state agencies were all set to attend, according to the agenda.
A Friday session was moderated by Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, who is a Ferguson appointee, and featured state legislators and others.
State officials discussing the future of nuclear energy at the state Capitol. It seems like a matter of public interest. We inquired with Commerce and the governor’s office to see if the event would be open to press. And so began the runaround.
A Commerce spokesperson told us it was not and that she had no information about who at the state level helped organize the event where the agency’s leader was speaking. 
The spokesperson referred us to the governor’s office — not unexpected given Ferguson’s efforts to ensure responses from agencies to the press are routed through his staff.
The governor’s office deferred questions about press access to the National Governors Association, offered no assistance with gaining access, and ignored queries about who’d organized the event. Though they said the governor would not attend.
The National Governors Association, which gets money from taxpayer-funded dues that states pay, then denied us access. The group’s press secretary described the event — featuring an agency director, lawmakers, and more than 100 attendees, including some from the nation’s most powerful companies — as “a small group of state staff and specialists.”
Exhibit 2
When Ferguson’s office sent out its last schedule update for the governor, on Sept. 17, it showed a meeting this past Monday between him and the other eight statewide elected officials. We asked for information last week about what would be discussed and who would attend.
The governor’s office didn’t provide any, even though an agenda had been sent to those invited. After further follow-up, we got a short statement late Wednesday from the governor’s office summarizing the meeting.
It largely mirrored social media posts Ferguson made the next morning, complete with a glossy-looking photo of him speaking. He said the group discussed litigation, a new report “showing the devastation of Trump’s tariffs,” and protecting Washingtonians’ data from federal overreach.
“All of your statewide elected officials are working very hard to be extremely coordinated in dealing with what’s coming at us from Washington D.C.,” he wrote on X and Facebook.
Not mentioned in Ferguson’s recap are mounting state budget troubles that are not directly related to anything the federal government is doing.
We’d like to ask the governor about his views on the state’s fiscal health, like his positions on approving more tax increases in 2026, and some of the significant budget requests that have emerged this month from state agencies.
But he continues to shun interviews. So we’re stuck prying written statements from his communications staff — like the one he issued this week on the state’s weakening revenues, where he again focused on Trump.
As for the Monday meeting and Ferguson’s subsequent social media posts, it seems more like spectacle than governing, with the governor framing the sitdown in a way that underscores a core tenet of his political platform: He’s standing up to the president.
If it felt different in the room, we couldn’t tell you. The doors were closed to us.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/governors-office-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s 2026 Teacher of the Year said she’s excited to advocate for her profession and shine a light on challenges educators are facing.
“Sometimes we have the people who are the furthest away from the classroom making those classroom decisions with policy,” said Frannie Tunseth, a reading and math teacher from Mayville. “I think sometimes it’s on us educators to make sure we’re giving them better information as to what’s actually happening so they can make some better choices.”
Tunseth, who teaches at Mayville-Portland-Clifford-Galesburg Public School, was recognized Friday during a ceremony at the North Dakota Capitol. She was selected for the annual award out of 48 county Teacher of the Year candidates, which were narrowed down to four finalists.
“It feels so surreal to be honest,” Tunseth said after the ceremony. “Being up with all of these amazing educators is so inspiring. I’m almost awestruck.”

Tunseth works as a math and reading interventionist for grades 4-8, helping students struggling to keep up with their peers in those areas.
She said she hopes to promote more sustained professional development for teachers and wants to ensure that teachers have the ability to control their own classrooms without being constrained.
During the ceremony, North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler said Tunseth’s love for teaching was evident in her award application. She added the application included numerous letters of support and examples of how she supports students who struggle with learning. 
“Teachers have the opportunity to change the world by lifting up the next generation, and Mrs. Tunseth understands this as well as anyone,” Baesler said. “Mrs. Tunseth’s teaching is truly inspirational.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong called teaching “the most noble profession we have in North Dakota.”
“Nobody affects the future of North Dakota more than our teachers,” said Armstrong, who presented Tunseth with a personalized North Dakota license plate that reads “NDTOY26.” 
He added teachers like Tunseth are inspiring the next generation of law enforcement, doctors, accountants and other professions each community in the state relies on.
Tunseth previously taught in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, Grand Forks and Hillsboro and served as principal for three years at Griggs County Central School in Cooperstown.
She holds both bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of North Dakota and is expected to receive a doctorate in teaching in 2027, according to a Department of Public Instruction news release.

Emily Dawes, a K-5 literacy specialist at Lake Agassiz Elementary School in Grand Forks
Hannah Sagvold, a business education teacher at Lisbon Public School
Leah Wheeling, sixth grade physical education and digital literacy teacher at Simle Middle School in Bismarck

Tunseth will represent North Dakota in the National Teacher of the Year competition that will be held in spring 2026.

The companies suspended the program over remarks the comedian made in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing. 
The move means “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will return to local TV on Nexstar’s ABC affiliates, including WTNH in Connecticut, along with the 38 stations where Sinclair agreed to restore the show. 
[RELATED: Protesters target WTNH over Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension]
Disney-owned ABC suspended Kimmel on Sept. 17, following threats of potential repercussions from the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission. Sinclair also condemned the host — confirming that it would stop airing the show the same day.
The Maryland-based broadcast giant, which is known for conservative political content, called on Kimmel at the time to apologize to Kirk’s family — and taking it a step further, asked him to “make a meaningful personal donation” to Turning Point USA, the nonprofit that Kirk founded.
On the day Kirk was killed, Kimmel shared a message of support for Kirk’s family and other victims of gun violence on social media, which he reiterated during his Tuesday return to ABC. He had also called the conservative activist’s assassination a “senseless murder” prior to being taken off air.
Kimmel’s original comments didn’t otherwise focus on Kirk. He instead lambasted President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the killing. The comedian did not apologize on Tuesday, but did say “it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man” and acknowledged that to some, his comments “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”
He also used a blend of humor and pointed messages to emphasize the importance of free speech.
Even after Disney brought Kimmel back to its national airways, both Sinclair and Nexstar continued to preempt the show.
New episodes of the show air Monday through Thursday. Friday night’s rerun will be of Tuesday’s show — so viewers of Sinclair stations can see Kimmel’s emotional return to the air.
In its statement Friday, Sinclair pointed to its “responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming.”
The company, which operates 38 ABC-affiliated stations, added that it had received “thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,” and noticed “troubling acts of violence,” referencing the shooting into the lobby of a Sacramento station.
“These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important,” Sinclair added.
As a result of Sinclair and Nexstar’s boycott, viewers in cities representing roughly a quarter of ABC’s local TV affiliates had been left without the late-night program on local TV. The blackouts escalated nationwide uproar around First Amendment protections — particularly as the Trump administration and other conservatives police speech after Kirk’s killing. They also cast a spotlight on political influence in the media landscape, with critics lambasting companies that they accuse of censoring content.
Ahead of his suspension, Kimmel took aim at the president and his “MAGA gang” of supporters for their response to Kirk’s killing, which Kimmel said included “finger-pointing” and attempts to characterize the alleged shooter as “anything other than one of them.”
These remarks angered many supporters of Kirk — as well as FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who accused Kimmel of appearing to “directly mislead the American public” with his remarks about the man accused of the killing. Ahead of Kimmel’s suspension, Carr warned that Disney and ABC’s local affiliates could face repercussions if the comedian was not punished.
He later applauded Sinclair, as well as Nexstar, for their decisions to preempt the show.
On Sept. 17, Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith called Kimmel’s comments “inappropriate and deeply insensitive” and said that ABC’s suspension wasn’t enough. Smith added that Sinclair appreciated Carr’s comments — and called for “immediate regulatory action” from the FCC “to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”
Still, in Friday’s announcement, Sinclair maintained that its decision to preempt Kimmel’s show was “independent of any government interaction or influence,” Sinclair’s statement Friday read, adding that broadcasters had the right to exercise their own judgment.
While local TV affiliates broadcast their own programming, such as local news, they also contract with larger national broadcasters — and pay them to air their national content, splitting advertising revenue and fees from cable companies.
Sinclair said “constructive” discussions with ABC were ongoing, and said its proposals to the network to strengthen accountability, feedback and dialogue and appoint an ombudsman had not yet been adopted.
Representatives for ABC declined to comment on Friday.
Matthew Dolgin, senior equity analyst at research firm Morningstar, said he wasn’t surprised by Sinclair’s decision.
“The relationship with Disney is far too important for these firms to risk,” Dolgin said. And setting aside legal rights from either side, he added, “Disney would’ve been free to take its affiliate agreements elsewhere in 2026 if these relationships were too difficult. That scenario would be devastating to Nexstar and Sinclair.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267236103074-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

And any agreement, they said, is likely weeks away.
Lawyers for a Calhoun County voter appeared before Judge Daniel Coble in a downtown Columbia courthouse Friday, asking the judge to temporarily block the South Carolina Election Commission from sharing the personal data of the state’s 3.3 million registered voters.

The U.S. Department of Justice last month asked for the information — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.
South Carolina voter Anne Crook, a former president of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, filed the lawsuit in response, citing privacy concerns.
“I’ll tell you what people are worried about,” Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is representing Crook, told the judge.
“They’re worried the DOJ is going to get this and they’re going to give it to DOGE. They’re worried DOJ is going to get this and they’re going to create a national database,” said the Orangeburg Democrat. “They’re worried DOJ is going to get this and give it to Homeland Security.”
Lawyers for the Election Commission argued there was no need for a temporary injunction blocking the information’s release because state law bars the agency from sharing it without an agreement in place.
Lawyers for Gov. Henry McMaster went further, asking the judge to throw the suit out altogether.
SC elections agency faces ongoing legal challenges over voter rolls amid directors’ firings

South Carolina already swaps voter information with other states, though that does not include driver’s license numbers, said Elizabeth Crum, an attorney for the Election Commission.
In all, the state shares its information with 32 states and Washington, D.C., election agency spokesman John Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette.
Most of that goes through a partnership organization known as Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC). The ERIC partners include both Democratic and Republican leaning states.
South Carolina also has freestanding agreements with Virginia, Ohio, and most recently, a nine-state agreement led by Texas.
And it has previously shared information with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Crum said in response to a question from the judge.

That information was used by DHS as part of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, which is related to immigration. The Election Commission did not immediately provide details about when and what data was shared as part of that program.
Crum pointed to those agreements as examples of how the state plans to approach any agreement with the federal Justice Department.
“They say what the purpose is that they’re used for. It also says who has access to them. It says how they’re transmitted,” she said. “And there are several other security requirements in each of them.”
“There is no reason to believe and every reason to be assured that the Election Commission is not going to share anyone’s data unless and until they have a (memorandum of understanding) that protects the security of confidential information,” Crum added.

Acting agency director Jennifer Wooten testified the Election Commission expects the Justice Department to send a draft of the agreement in the next few weeks. The two agencies will then negotiate further on what the final document includes.
Crum also told the judge the Election Commission will hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed agreement before voting on whether to approve it.
In arguing that the case should be thrown out altogether, Grayson Lambert, the governor’s lawyer, said it’s the constitutional right of the federal government to regulate federal elections.
Because the state does not maintain separate state and federal voter rolls, he said, the federal government has a legitimate reason for wanting access to the information.
Hutto commended the Election Commission for making its assurances.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

“We all want safe elections,” he said. “We all want fair elections. We don’t want any fraud in elections.
If DOJ has the purest intention of using this information only for the security of the voter database, I don’t know that anybody objects to that,” he continued. “They have failed to say that. They will not answer that question.”
For that reason, Hutto said his client asked the judge to “maintain the status quo until such time as these assurances are in place, so that she can have the comfort and everybody in South Carolina can have comfort that their personal identifying information is protected from misuse and abuse.”
Judge Coble said he will rule on the matter at a later date.

(Photo via Google Earth)A second group of Keokuk residents have filed a potential class-action lawsuit against a corn-processing plant in the city, claiming noxious odors from the plant have created a public nuisance.
The lawsuit, filed this week in federal court, is the second of its type to be filed against Roquette America, a corn syrup and corn starch producer.
In June, two individuals who own property within 1,000 feet the plant, David M. Dye and Steve L. Andrews, sued the company and claimed they’ve been damaged by a “significant” increase in odors emanating from the site. That lawsuit is still pending.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The new lawsuit, based on similar claims, has been filed on behalf of two other Keokuk residents, Anne-Marie Helenthal and Debra Hunter.
The two lawsuits allege the plant features a wastewater treatment system to treat corn-processing byproducts and industrial waste, and that the company has failed to install, maintain and operate adequate odor mitigating strategies.
“The foul odors emitted from the defendant’s facility are offensive, would be offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary health and sensibilities, and have caused property damage,” the newly filed lawsuit claims.
The lawsuits have yet to be granted class-action status, but the most recent filing quotes putative class members Lana and John Jefferson as saying the smell “sometimes gets so thick in the air you almost puke,” and that despite building a new porch to sit outside they sometimes “just go back in ’cause of the smell and noise,” leaving them feeling trapped in their own home.
Court records indicate the plant was built about 122 years ago. However, the wastewater treatment facility on the site wasn’t constructed until 1977. In 1991, Roquette purchased the plant, and in 2013, Roquette allegedly began expanding its wastewater treatment system. According to court records, Roquette created an “overflow tank” in 2023 that resulted in a near-constant “foul and offensive odor” once it became operational.
The lawsuits allege the plant’s wastewater treatment is subject to separation-distance requirements that legally restrict its operations if there are habitable structures within 1,000 feet of the plant, unless a waiver has been signed by the nearby landowners.
Dye and Andrews claim they don’t recall signing any such waiver. “The odor far exceeds any typical normal operating procedural smells,” their lawsuit claims, adding that the smell is so severe that Dye and Andrews have had to leave their homes and stay in hotels, avoid using air conditioning or heating in order to prevent outside air from entering their homes, and avoid outdoor activities at home.
The odor, they allege, “contains harmful gases” that endanger their physical and mental health.
Federal records show that in October 2024, Roquette agreed to pay $207,488 in civil penalties for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act related to the Keokuk plant. The company also agreed to donate emergency response vehicles to the Keokuk Fire Department as part of the settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
According to the EPA, the company stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, on site and failed to comply with regulations intended to protect the surrounding community from accidental releases.
In addition, the lawsuits claim, Roquette previously entered into a consent decree with the EPA over alleged violations at the plant.
The lawsuits allege negligence in the construction and use of the plant; the creation of a nuisance that has deposited silt upon homes and vehicles and destroyed vegetation; and trespassing in the form of air contaminants that have “physically invaded” the plaintiffs’ property.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as an injunction permanently barring Roquette from diverting odor onto the plaintiffs’ property or interfering with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their property.
An attorney for Roquette America has declined to comment on the litigation, but in response to the lawsuit filed in June, the company denied any wrongdoing and asserted that it “operates as a reasonable corn milling plant” that is “currently in compliance with all applicable permits.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — Kansas hospital leaders sent a letter to the state’s congressional delegation urging members to extend premium tax credits for those who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.
Republicans in Congress, including the state’s two senators and three of the four House members, stripped the tax credits from low-income families as part of a tax and spending bill earlier this year. As the federal government approaches a possible shutdown next week, Democrats are refusing to support a short-term spending plan unless Republicans make the tax credits permanent.
Health care providers say the loss of tax credits will especially hurt families and hospitals in rural parts of the state.
“The reality is that for a rural hospital like ours, every dollar counts,” said Preston Sayers, CEO of Kingman Healthcare Center. “A failure to extend the tax credits will cause Kansans to lose their coverage, and they often won’t qualify for Medicaid. This will lead to a surge in uncompensated care and make it even more difficult to keep our doors open and provide the care our communities depend on.”
More than 160,000 Kansans benefit from the tax credits that are expected to expire. They can expect to see a 77% increase in premiums.
That means a hike of $2,500 per year for a family earning $64,000 per year, or $18,000 for a 60-year-old couple making $82,800 per year, according to a news release from Ascension Via Christi, which operates hospitals in Wichita.
“As health care providers on the front lines of patient care, we know firsthand the devastating impact that a loss of affordable coverage would have on our communities,” said Kevin Strecker, CEO of Ascension Via Christi. “This is a direct threat to the financial well-being of Kansas families and the stability of our health care system, particularly our rural hospitals, which serve as a lifeline for their communities.”
In the letter sent Thursday to all six members of the state’s congressional delegation, the hospital leaders said as Kansans lose coverage, hospitals will face rising costs from uncompensated care. The letter was sent to Republican Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, and Republican Reps. Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Tracey Mann.
It was signed by leaders of Ascension Via Christi, Caldwell Regional Medical Center, Children’s Mercy Kansas City, Greenwood County Hospital, Hillsboro Community Hospital, Kingman Healthcare Center, NMC Health in Newton, Patterson Health Center in Anthony, Salina Regional Health Center and Wesley Healthcare.
“Allowing the premium tax cuts to expire will directly affect our ability as a rural health care provider to care for the community where we live, work and serve,” said Vallerie Gleason, President and CEO of NMC Health. “I urge our Kansas congressional delegation, who care deeply about rural Kansas and rural hospitals, to support extensions of the premium tax cuts.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has begun to reimburse Florida law enforcement for acting as federal immigration enforcement by arresting and detaining undocumented immigrants.
And though they presented Gov. Ron DeSantis Friday with hefty checks signed by President Donald Trump totaling more than $38.4 million for transportation and equipment costs, the federal government has yet to cover the at-minimum $245 million price tag for the Everglades detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The clock is ticking. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it will award the grant Florida requested weeks ago by Tuesday, Sept. 30 — now just five days away.
But DeSantis isn’t worried.
“What I said from the beginning on this is we will get reimbursed eventually,” he said at a press conference Friday afternoon, standing alongside ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. 
“I saw [White House Border Czar] Tom Homan the other day and he’s just like, ‘Send us your reimbursements. We got a lot of money now, we want to help you guys.’ So that’ll happen,” the governor continued.
He added that the only people detained at the site are “military-aged males,” and that the “cadence” of deportation flights out of the “Deportation Depot” center in Baker County is going so well, the state will be up to five flights per week starting next week. 
The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) applied to be federally reimbursed for the Everglades site sometime in mid-September. The timing is iffy, although the Florida Phoenix confirmed it happened shortly after a federal appeals court ruled that a federal environmental law did not apply to the facility — keeping it open — because it hadn’t received federal dollars.
Less than eight days later, FDEM asked for federal reimbursement. The money, if approved, would come from FEMA’s new Detention Support Grant Program, which has roughly $608.4 million in its coffers. 
ICE’s $1.7B state partnership push
On Friday, DeSantis spoke from the Florida Sheriffs Association building alongside law enforcement, ICE officials, and Uthmeier, who brainstormed Everglades site in mid-June alongside the Department of Homeland Security.
ICE announced that $1.7 billion will go to various states with ICE partnerships, called 287(g) agreements. This money will fund the costs of equipment needed to transport undocumented migrants. Florida accounts for $38.4 million of that total, or roughly 2.26%.
$28.4 million will go to state law enforcement and $10 million to local law enforcement. The overall breakdown is $2.7 million in transportation funding for local agencies, $7.3 million in equipment funding for 974 local officers, $1 million in transportation funding for state agencies, and $27.5 million for 3,676 state officers.
These are all officers or agencies that have entered into a 287(g) agreement, which deputizes state and local law enforcement as federal immigration actors and empowers them to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants.
Florida mandated all counties and all county sheriffs to sign 287(g) agreements through a controversial new law in February. Lawsuits immediately began to crop up, one of which included a federal judge blocking officers from making these arrests. Uthmeier, who instructed law enforcement to do so anyways, was held in civil contempt (though it was later overturned).
That case has ping-ponged to a federal appellate court, to the Florida Supreme Court, and is now back in the appellate court pending oral arguments in October. Other cases included the city of South Miami questioning whether cities must enter into 287(g) agreements, Democrats arguing humanitarian violations at the Everglades site, and environmental groups trying to shut down that facility over concerns of harming the Everglades.
“Our state agencies are going to be reimbursed,” DeSantis assured Friday. “Some people tried to say that wasn’t gonna happen, and I think today with these checks, this is just the beginning.”

In a ruling earlier this week, the panel of three appellate judges said that Gabriel Metcalf’s conviction should be overturned because he offered a plausible interpretation and understanding of federal gun law, even while acknowledging that federal district court judge Susan Watters had a more straightforward and traditional definition of the law.
The majority opinion, written by Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke, a former Montana Solicitor General, noted that Metcalf appears to be the only person to test whether Montana’s open carry gun law complied with the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. In his appeal, Metcalf also raised concerns that his conviction also violated his Second Amendment rights, but the appellate court stopped short of deciding that issue, ruling instead that Metcalf’s interpretation of the law was plausible, and therefore he could not have known he was violating federal law.
Judge Mary M. Schroeder issued a dissenting opinion in the case, saying that VanDyke and Judge John B. Owens had reached their conclusion “by means of a tortured application” of judicial principles, even while acknowledging that Watters had the better and more traditional interpretation of state and federal law.
VanDyke was appointed by President Donald J. Trump to the appellate court during Trump’s first term, and before that served as Assistant Solicitor General for Texas, Solicitor General of Montana and Solicitor General of Nevada. Owens was appointed by President Barack Obama.
However, VanDyke, writing the majority opinion, said that because Metcalf had provided a “plausible” reading of the law, and that there was no case law that could have possibly helped him understand the nuances of Montana’s gun laws and how they interact with federal law, the court was obligated to overturn the conviction.
“Our decision is a narrow one,” the ruling said. “Metcalf was the first, and to our knowledge, only person in Montana to have raised the license exception in response to a charge for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act.”
  Scaring kids vs. verifying eligibility 

Metcalf lived across the street from Broadwater Elementary, which sits on the busy thoroughfare of Broadwater Avenue in the heart of Billings.
Residents and school leaders, as well as local law enforcement, had become alarmed when they saw Metcalf “patrolling” the neighborhood with guns, just across the street from the school’s playground.
Billings Police officers had been dispatched many times to talk with Metcalf, but concluded that state law offered no remedy. Still, school officials for a time abandoned part of the playground, moving students to the back side of the building and putting a black tarp up that blocked the view of the elementary students as a precaution.
Meanwhile, Metcalf claimed that a former neighbor, since convicted of felony, had been harassing he and his mother with whom he lived, and that he was simply patrolling his property, defending himself and protecting his mother whom he walked to work and back. Metcalf’s mother had a restraining order in place against this former neighbor, and court records confirm that the man had indeed been actively bothering Metcalf and his mother.
Metcalf had grown so weary of visits by local law enforcement that he called federal authorities to report that his Second Amendment Rights had been violated. However, officers with the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agency instead found that he was violating federal law by carrying a gun in a gun-free school zone.

But the appeals court in its review noted that Montana’s gun law was unique and ambiguous. While state law allows a person who has not been convicted of violent felony to carry a gun in a gun-free school zone, the state law also says that the person must be “verified.” However, Montana doesn’t specify a verification process or a special licensing process; instead, the Legislature has granted broad gun rights to all citizens who haven’t been convicted of a violent felony.
“The Montana Legislature has made clear that it enacted its state license to comply with federal law, and it did so by directly licensing individuals by statute, rather than by delegating authority to separate state or local agencies,” the ruling said. “Because Congress did not make a clear statement prohibiting Montana’s decision to act, the legislature, rather than through delegated authority other than state officials, Metcalf’s proffered interpretation finds support.”
However, the appeals court also noted that Watters may have correctly determined that Montana’s gun carrying laws may not comport with the federal gun-free zone act. It also said that there was no way — no case law — that Metcalf could have relied upon to make that determination.
“Per the district court, ‘Montana Individual Licensure does not meet this requirement because it automatically considers every person in the state to be licensed then claws back licensure from those who have committed violent felonies or are disqualified by the Montana Constitution,’” the decision said.
But because of the law’s ambiguity, the appellate court found Metcalf could not have known what was lawful.
“Both the government and the district court seemed to equate the act of ‘verifying’ with conducting an individualized background (or qualifications) check,” the court’s opinion said. “A background check is certainly one way of verifying that an individual is qualified to hold a license. But, it is not the only way of doing it.”
While the district court judge found that Metcalf had not been verified to carry a gun in the area, Metcalf’s belief that he didn’t need to go through a formal process was “plausible.”
“Metcalf lacked the appropriate notice to be convicted of violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act. Affirming Metcalf’s conviction would be inconsistent with the principles of fair notice and of not punishing innocent conduct,” the appeals court ruled.
Schroeder, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, balked at the other two judge’s conclusions, saying they adopted the judge’s reasoning as a correct and the more credible interpretation, but twisted the law to favor Metcalf.
“The majority stretches these principles in Metcalf’s case because it apparently views him to be a sympathetic person who has been unjustly treated,” she said. The result leaves him free to pick up arms and continue to frighten the neighbors, that include the school across the street.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG-7188-scaled-e1733786147380-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY —  Oklahoma’s mental health department hasn’t met the required benchmarks of a consent decree settling a 2023 lawsuit, according to a report published Friday. 
The agency has produced “incomplete and internally conflicting” data, submitted plans missing essential information, and has not demonstrated “true urgency” in dealing with the consent decree, the report found.
While the leadership of recently appointed Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic has led to a “new approach” to the consent decree, “hard work and good efforts do not necessarily equate to best efforts,” the report written by a team of court-appointed consultants found. 
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has made improvements in its communication with consultants, workplace culture, leadership and on some of the benchmarks, according to the report. 
The landmark consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. 
It’s expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. Failure to comply could result in financial penalties. 
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, said the agency continues to work closely with the court-appointed consultants and values their guidance. 
“We appreciate the consultant’s recognition of our progress,” she said in a statement Friday. “Change of this scale doesn’t happen overnight, but the court consultants’ advice has been crucial to our progress. (The Mental Health Department) is working to implement all recommendations and is committed to satisfying the best efforts requirement of the consent decree.”
The report revealed inconsistencies in data and a lack of a carefully considered plan to carry out the consent decree. For example, the consultants wrote they received conflicting reports of how many people are currently awaiting competency restoration services and the average time spent on a waitlist. 
The consultants said the agency failed to meet benchmarks across multiple categories, which could result in either financial or injunctive remedies. 
They offered guidance for the issues throughout the report and said financial penalties will only be incurred in this instance if other “recommendations and deliverables are not first satisfied.”
“While we offer no excuses for (the Mental Health Department), we also believe that the Department’s administrative forensic service continues to operate with a shoestring staff and limited funding,” the consultants writing the report wrote. “Important changes have occurred, but the Department needs more resources, including a senior official in charge of the Decree with exclusive responsibility for its implementation, as well as the infusion of additional funding for staff salaries, new hires, and additional resources.” 
Slavonic’s leadership has created a new “tone” within the agency that allows for staff to work more freely with the consultants and steps have been taken to change critical leadership, the report found. But the Mental Health Department is still far behind in its efforts to comply with the consent decree, the report said. 
Allie Friesen, the former commissioner, was originally tasked with carrying out the terms of the consent decree and was named in the lawsuit. Friesen was fired by state lawmakers in May following weeks of uncertainty about the agency’s finances. 
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the report was “alarming” and it will take “tremendous effort” to get the agency on track with the consent decree’s required timeline. 
“The consent decree that my office helped broker will save the state untold millions of dollars, but it is critical that the Department of Mental Health actually comply with the plan,” he said in a statement.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state heath insurance plan is going to help members who use Duke doctors find alternative medical providers, as protracted negotiations over payments drag on. 
Duke Health and Aetna, the health plan’s third-party administrator, have been locked in negotiations for months. The contract between Aetna and Duke Health expires Oct. 20. State Health Plan trustees approved a resolution Friday that will have offer “white-glove service” to beneficiaries who use Duke in helping them find new doctors.
Aetna insures about 1.5 million North Carolina residents, including about 750,000 through the state employee health plan. If there’s no agreement by Oct. 20, Duke Health will no longer be part of Aetna’s provider network, and most patients who continue to see its doctors will pay higher costs. That means thousands of state employees and teachers would pay higher medical bills if they remain Duke patients. 
Adopting a contingency plan is unprecedented move, and state Treasurer Brad Briner said he is holding out hope for an agreement by the contract deadline. 
“If we end up out of network, Duke is the one who made that choice,” he said. “They will have made that choice that their financial goals are more important than their mission to serve.”
He criticized what he called Duke’s “aggressive tactics” – radio ads and letters to beneficiaries – which he said were meant to scare them and convince them to argue on the health system’s behalf. 
Briner said the public pressure campaign was beneath one of the state’s preeminent non-profit hospitals. 
In a prepared statement, Duke Health said it is continuing good-faith negotiations with Aetna to ensure patients covered under the insurer’s plans can continue uninterrupted access to Duke primary care doctors and specialists. 
“We have a responsibility to our patients to communicate about potential impacts to Duke Health care access,” said the statement attributed to Duke Health officials.  “They may need more time than the required notice period allows. We’ve sent communications to our patients to provide them with context on the negotiations, continuity of care and how they can provide feedback to both negotiating parties, Duke Health and Aetna.”
Despite rising costs, Duke Health has not received a rate adjustment from Aetna in four years, the statement said, adding that the increases it is requesting are below the rate of inflation. 
“We recognize and understand the pressures facing the State Health Plan,” the statement said. ”Less than 6% of State Health Plan members receive care at Duke Health and the modest increases we’re seeking from Aetna would have minimal to no effect on premiums.”
The 22,000 people on the state health plan and who have a Duke primary care doctor, and about 40,000 members who have filed a claim through Duke this year will be contacted about finding new medical providers. 
About 2,800 people on state health insurance who use Duke Health for treatments are protected under the continuity of care law. They will be able to continue to use Duke Health as an in-network provider after the contract expires, but need to fill out paperwork. These are mostly patients receiving maternity care or cancer treatments.
Duke Health came under blistering criticism from Dr. Brian Miller, a health plan trustee, who recited figures from Duke Health’s financial audits, and noted its $4.3 billion in investments. 
“This does not sound like a health system that is in financial distress,” he said. “Duke is choosing to prioritize its investment portfolio instead of the heath of local citizens who work as custodians, help take care of parks, local teachers. They would rather pad their investment portfolio off the backs of these workers. I find that a fundamental moral failure, and I am sincerely disappointed.”
Health Plan Executive Director Tom Friedman said after the trustees meeting that the plan asked every provider to either hold the line on costs or even take less next year as the plan moved to close its financial hole. It cannot now give one provider a lot more after asking others to sacrifice, he said. 
“How are we going to look them straight in the eye and say ‘Yes, this was fair,” Friedman said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4769-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Wyoming’s public records ombudsman is trying to get the word out about a task force that seeks to improve the law that gives citizens access to government work.
The post Little public notice of Monday’s critical public meeting regarding Public Records Act appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s public records ombudsman says there’s been little public notice of a public meeting regarding the Public Records Act scheduled for Monday, and she’s trying to get the word out.
An appointee in Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, Darlena Potter, agreed to chair a legislative committee’s working group on Monday to hash out changes to the law. The goal is to make improvements sought by the public, state and local agencies and governments — changes that could be adopted by the Legislature in early 2026.
But lacking the official status that would allow her working group the public-notice resources and reach of the Legislative Service Office, Potter is scrambling to let policy wonks, reporters and even the odd town-council gadfly a chance to weigh in.
“A lot of folks are requesting things such as how their local entities’ monies are being used.” Darlena Potter
Public records requests have increased significantly in recent years, Potter said.
“A lot of folks are requesting things such as how their local entities’ monies are being used,” she said. Citizens are “trying to get a grasp on the transparency issue of what sort of items their taxpayer dollars are going towards.”
She called the increase in public records requests “a huge shift, which is kind of encouraging.”
Citizens are trying to educate themselves, she said, but “they’ve run into a few hurdles.”
The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions that considered two draft bills at its Aug. 14 meeting also encountered bumps. Scheduled for an hour and 45 minutes of discussion, the public records deliberation lasted more than five hours before lawmakers assigned Potter the task of shaking things out through a working group.
The group will meet for the first time at 10 a.m. Monday in Room W-113 of the Wyoming Capitol. People can participate remotely through this Zoom link.
‘Any information…’
A public record is “any information in a physical form created, accepted, or obtained by a governmental entity in furtherance of its official function and transaction of public business,” according to the law. Wyoming Statute 16-4-201 through 205 requires that “all public records shall be open for inspection by any person,” with some obvious exceptions for privacy reasons. Records custodians can charge a reasonable fee for copies.
Three topics are foremost among Potter’s worries. One is the timeline for responding to and delivering public records sought through a request.
“Currently, the statute mandates a seven business-day acknowledgment of a public records request and production of documents within 30 calendar days,” Potter wrote in a memo. One proposal suggests a three-day acknowledgment and 10 calendar day production of documents, but that framework remains under debate.
Another issue is the cost of obtaining copies of public records. Because laws prevent some private information from being released, some requests require costly review by lawyers.
“There was some discussion of standardizing these,” Potter said of the August committee meeting discussion. “Some areas of the state are more expensive than others to produce the same types of documentation and, in the state statute, it just says ‘reasonable’ [fees].”
Finally, there’s the issue of data mining. Potter said she’s seeing lots of requests from out-of-state entities for a large volume of information.
Consider, for example, all the gear companies and outfitters who might want a list of addresses of the holders of Wyoming elk licenses. Imagine an entrepreneur’s 2025 pitch: “Want to buy a corner-crossing ladder?”People who want to learn more about the corporations committee’s struggles and draft legislation can access meeting materials and a recording of the August session on the LSO website.

In addition to sunsetting a 30% residential solar tax credit for homeowners at the end of this year, the Trump administration has terminated investment tax credits for clean energy technologies.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Sept. 25, 2025.
This week, Catamount Solar technicians are expected to power up Randolph’s Community Solar 2 project, a recently completed, net-metering array on Beanville Road that may be the last of its kind in Vermont, at least for a while.
The future of such arrays, wherein community members buy shares and reap a reduced electric bill for years to come, has taken a hit from the state. Vermont no longer allows new group net-metering projects.
“We had to really hustle because after December 31, just passed, there were going to be no more permits approved,” said Jerry Ward, a retired physician who serves as the lead community organizer on CS2. “So we, in December, got that permit filed. And as of now, there will be nothing like this again until the law changes again.”
Still, during a visit to the CS2 site last Friday, the mood was celebratory.
“It’s definitely an exciting moment,” said Kevin McCollister, co-founder of Catamount Solar, as he walked down to the array, checking to make sure Green Mountain Power had delivered a meter.
GMP had, “so now we’ll get our guys back here to commission it.”

McCollister explained the basics of what’s next: the array will be turned on and start making power, and the credits from the power will be shared among the project’s subscribers according to the number of shares that they purchased.
CS2, a member-owned LLC, has 22 subscribers from the greater Randolph area. Typically an array of this size — it consists of 324 solar panels — benefits about 25 average households, Ward explained, but a few of CS2’s members are “pretty big.”
Ward and McCollister noted two more entities who will benefit from the array. Thanks to two anonymous shareholders, one in Brookfield and one in Royalton, the food shelves in Randolph and South Royalton will receive renewable energy credits on their utility bills.
The cost of buying into CS2, for an average household — about 4% of the array — is about $25,000, said Ward.
“It’d be about like buying it (for) your roof, a little bit cheaper.”
Over the first year, shareholders can expect to save about $172 per kilowatt; a 5-kW share would amount to savings of about $860 a year.
CS2 takes up about three-quarters of an acre on a 1.5-acre patch of land owned by Matt and Sarah Murawski on Beanville Road. CS1, Randolph’s first community solar project, on South Randolph Road, was developed about 10 years ago.
Completion of CS2 comes at a time when the federal government is darkening the future of solar, with energy policies that push costs higher for consumers.
In addition to a 30% residential solar tax credit for homeowners going away at the end of this year, the Trump administration has terminated investment tax credits for clean energy technologies — with various effective dates — and ordered the Internal Revenue Service to revise a safe-harbor provision that would have protected some project timelines for clean energy developers.
“What we’re seeing on the federal level is atrocious,” said McCollister, who is set to retire later this year. “It’s terrible, for so many reasons and on so many levels. And for whatever reason, this administration really doesn’t like renewables, especially wind and solar, and they’re really trying to do everything they can to stop it.”
While expressing his dismay over federal actions, McCollister noted that solar is not going away, “especially in Vermont,” where “people understand that it’s important.
“We need to do something. People want to do something to address climate change. It’s something that’s very practical that individuals and homeowners can do to make a difference. And on top of it, our electricity rates are only going up,” he said, noting that, historically, GMP had about 3 to 3.5% rate increases annually.
This year, the rate increase is 7.4%.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Air National Guard/Master Sgt. Megan Floyd)COLUMBIA — The state is under a state of emergency as a so far-unnamed tropical disturbance potentially heads toward the coast, Gov. Henry McMaster declared Friday.
A state of emergency frees up the resources and state employees to prepare for the possibility of landfall, along with allowing state and local authorities to apply for federal emergency reimbursements if needed, according to a news release.
It also triggered the state’s anti-price-gouging law.
Meteorologists are predicting a 90% chance the disturbance, designated Friday as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, will become a tropical storm over the weekend. If that happens, the disturbance will be named Imelda.
South Carolina residents, especially along the coast, should prepare for high winds, potentially causing power outages, along with heavy rainfall and storm surge early next week, according to the National Weather Service.
“While the storm’s arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,” McMaster said in a news release. “We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations.”
The disturbance’s path remains uncertain, according to a mid-day National Weather Service briefing. The system could strike the Carolinas early next week or linger just over the ocean near South Carolina, dumping rain on coastal cities, meteorologists wrote.
Or, the disturbance could approach the coast before veering back out to sea, like Hurricane Humberto, another approaching storm, is expected to do.
The proximity of the two storms is part of the reason for uncertainty.
Meteorologists are unsure whether the two might collide, forming another system, or send each other spinning off onto different courses, according to the briefing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/8574450-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(File photo NC Newsline)  Former North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse will oversee county boards of elections in a new role with the State Auditor’s Office, Auditor Dave Boliek announced in an email to county board chairs.
“To assist in your efforts to ensure election integrity while encouraging maximum participation in our elections, I have appointed Dallas Woodhouse as my liaison to the local and state board of elections,” Boliek wrote. “Mr. Woodhouse will serve as my eyes and ears on the ground in our elections process.”
Woodhouse’s responsibilities as election liaison, a new role in the auditor’s office, will include shaping early voting plans, election policy, and oversight, according to the email. He declined to comment, referring the request to a spokesperson for Boliek.
He served as executive director for the state GOP from 2015 to 2019, after which he held roles in the John Locke Foundation and the Civitas Institute, prominent right-leaning think tanks in the state. Woodhouse has served as North Carolina executive director of American Majority, a conservative training nonprofit, since 2023.
Randy Brechbiel, a spokesperson for the state auditor, wrote in a statement that “election liaison is his current and only role,” indicating he would not continue to work for the nonprofit. He wrote that Woodhouse will focus on efforts to “ensure election integrity” and support “maximum participation in elections.”
Gerry Cohen, a member of the Wake County Board of Elections, said he spoke with Woodhouse soon after the announcement and believes he is “serious about it” and “has the knowledge base to perform the role,” though added that “doesn’t mean I agree with everything.”
“I’ve known Dallas for like 15 years or so and had a good working relationship with him, and I think it’s good to have somebody who knows something about elections in the process,” he said.
In his role with the state GOP, Woodhouse pushed GOP county board members to limit early voting to deter same-day registration, eliminate Sunday voting and block early voting sites on college campuses.
“We believe same-day registration is ripe with voter fraud, or the opportunity to commit it,” Woodhouse wrote in a 2016 memo. “Same-day registration is only available during early voting. We are under no obligation to offer more opportunities for voter fraud.”
Ahead of the 2024 election, Woodhouse voiced greater openness for early voting, urging conservatives to “vote as soon as possible or be prepared to lose” in a column for The Carolina Journal. He said he planned to complete his own mail-in ballot at the earliest opportunity.
Cohen cautioned against reading into statements Woodhouse made as a party official.
“I just wouldn’t assume that positions that Dallas took 10 years ago when he was executive director of the state Republican Party, I would not assume that has anything to do with how he will handle this job working for the state government assisting in administration of elections,” he said.

Thanks to a federal judge’s order, the 27-year-old DACA recipient was released Wednesday from the Otero County Processing Center in New Mexico. (Courtesy ACLU-NM)A federal judge in New Mexico this week ordered the release of a 27-year-old man held in federal immigration detention in Chaparral for 42 days, a detention that occurred even though he had previously received a federal promise of deferred deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira at his home in Horizon City, Texas on Aug. 13, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. Agents then took Gamez Lira to the Otero County Processing Center in Southern New Mexico, where he was held until Wednesday.
Gamez Lira has lived in the United States since infancy, according to the ACLU, and he successfully secured Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status after President Barack Obama signed an executive order granting deportation protections in 2012. Gamez Lira, a father of four who works as a forklift driver, had valid DACA status when ICE agents detained him, according to the ACLU.

The civil rights group and private law-firm Singleton Schreiber, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence, sued Sept. 3 in federal court, alleging Gamez Lira’s constitutional rights were being violated. 
In response, acting United States Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison said the government did not oppose Gamez Lira’s release, according to a Wednesday court filing, though he wrote that the government’s lack of opposition to his release does mean it accepts factual or legal allegations his lawyers made in the lawsuit. 
Shortly after Ellison’s filing, federal judge William P. Johnson ordered Gamez Lira’s immediate release Wednesday. 
“This has been the most difficult time of our lives, but we never lost hope that justice would prevail,” said Alejandra Gamez Lira, the detainee’s wife, in a statement provided by the ACLU. 
ICE previously declined to comment about the lawsuit in a statement to Source New Mexico, citing the federal litigation. 
Gamez Lira’s lawyers celebrated his release and criticized ICE for arresting a DACA recipient. 
“This case shows that the government absolutely should refrain from detaining DACA recipients, and we are grateful that swift legal action here has resulted in Paulo being reunited with his loved ones,” said Becca Sheff, a lawyer with the ACLU-NM, in a statement.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp_image_2025-09-02_at_5.27.41_pm_5-e1758921002646.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Ron DeSantis (right), Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees (at the podium), then-Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, (left) and then-Deputy Secretary for Health Shamarial Roberson (far left). (Photo by Issac Morgan/Florida Phoenix)Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo has dismissed concerns that not enough research was done before he and Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last month that they intend to dismantle school vaccine mandates, saying this is an issue of “parents’ rights.”
But his predecessor — Dr. Scott Rivkees — says the matter has “nothing” to do with parental rights.
“This is part of an organized strategy to undermine vaccinations in Florida,” said Rivkees, who was Florida’s surgeon general from 2019-2021.
“This is a string of different policies and different statements that [Dr. Ladapo] has made to undermine vaccination. As far as this notion about personal freedom, I get that. But on the other hand, we can talk about personal freedom for one group of individuals who actually will impinge on the personal freedom of other individuals,” he continued.
“If we don’t have enough population protection, which means vaccinating children, individuals who may be immunocompromised, people who have been treated for cancer, people who are older, they’re actually going to have their rights and liberties trampled on by not being able to go out in public when outbreaks occur.”
Speaking on WMNF 88.5 FM radio to a Phoenix reporter on Friday, Rivkees, now a professor of medicine at Brown University, said the proposal offered by Ladapo and DeSantis to make Florida the first state in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements “is a predetermined ideology that is not based on science.”
“Vaccines have prevented hundreds of millions of deaths. For vaccinations to work, you need two things to happen: Parents need to vaccinate their children. But also, because some individuals vaccines are not 100% effective — you know, people are immunocompromised — people [who] have cancer are also dependent upon other people being vaccinated for their children so that we have population safety.”
mRNA vaccines
Speaking on a podcast called “On Call” with Houston physician Dr. Mary Talley Bowden earlier this month, Dr. Ladapo said he didn’t want mRNA Covid-19 vaccines available in the state. “The goal with the mRNA is for that not to be available to anyone, because no one should be using that one,” he said.
If Ladapo wants to rid the state of mRNA vaccines, he should provide other options, Rivkees said.
“Last year, Dr. Ladapo said no one should have mRNA vaccines but did not propose any alternatives for people. What are they going to do instead?” he asked, adding that the opposition to mRNA vaccines makes no sense.
“This is something that has been looked at extensively,” he said. “There’ve been just under a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines that have been given in the U.S. They’ve been incredibly effective. … The notion that they get into the human genome [and] affect our genes is absolutely not true. So, these are vaccines that are safe. They’re effective. During the pandemic they are estimated to have saved anywhere between two and three million lives.”
Ladapo already has the power to remove some vaccine requirements by simple rule changes. That means that starting in early December (taking effect 90 days after the Sept. 3 announcement) school vaccinations will no longer be required for hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus type b (Hib), and pneumococcal conjugate virus. That’s according to a statement sent by the Florida Department of Health that was reported by ABC News.
Others, however, including poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, and rubella are still in place and won’t be removed unless the Legislature opts to do so when it convenes for its 2026 session in January.
Rivkees was a practicing pediatric endocrinologist and working as a professor and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine when the governor picked him to lead the Florida Department of Health and serve as surgeon general in April 2021. He had also served as associate chair of pediatrics for research at the Yale University School of Medicine and was on the faculty at Harvard Medical School.
In his first year as surgeon general, Rivkees declared a public health emergency and encouraged vaccinations in Florida after more than 2,000 cases of Hepatitis A were registered in the state. He then led the efforts to vaccinate more than 200,000 people against the virus.
DeSantis ‘pivot’ on vaccines
When COVID-19 emerged early in 2020, Rivkees led the effort once the mRNA vaccine was available to administer. Florida had one of highest vaccination rates against the novel coronavirus and lowest death rates per capita in the country because the governor “embraced Covid vaccines,” he said.
“There was a major pivot by Gov. DeSantis about halfway through the pandemic,” he now says.
“We went to a situation where all of a sudden he stopped supporting vaccines. Vaccination rates fell and then, when the Delta wave hit in the summer of 2021, Florida went from having among the best vaccination rates and lowest mortality rates to among the worst. We see the painful consequences of changes in these policies.
“Being a pediatrician, having seen severe cases of childhood meningitis, chicken pox, hepatitis B, it breaks my heart that again we can be relieving these horrible diseases that cause so much harm to children and are vaccine preventable. “
A survey of 631 registered Florida voters conducted by Bendixen & Amandi International taken Sept. 7-9 found that 60% opposed ending vaccine mandates and just 37% supporting it.

A new report ranks states on extreme weather and air quality risks.
(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine have the best combination of relatively low environmental risks and robust environmental policies, according to a report released this week.
West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi ranked lowest on the 50-state scorecard produced by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that advocates for health care improvements.
Researchers at Northeastern and Yale universities ranked states based on risks from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, natural hazard risks to health care facilities and greenhouse gas emissions by the health care sector. The authors of the report also analyzed states’ clean energy policies and climate change mitigation efforts.
Climate change poses a severe threat to public health, leading health organizations have warned. Poor air quality, for example, contributes to between 100,000 and 200,000 excess U.S. deaths per year. Communities of color, low-income people, outdoor workers, people  with disabilities and homeless people are  more vulnerable to health harms associated with climate change.

In Florida, for example, nearly 15% of hospital beds are in high-hazard flood zones, according to the report — the highest share of any state. Coastal states Louisiana and Mississippi, where around 10% of hospital beds are in flood zones, also fared poorly.
West Virginia, Wyoming, and North Dakota had the highest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions from the health care sector in 2020. That year, West Virginia’s health care sector emitted 2,570 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent —- a measure of greenhouse gases’ warming effects —- per capita.
The report comes two days after President Donald Trump rebuffed the scientific consensus on climate change in his address to the United Nations General Assembly. “This ‘climate change’ – it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said in his Tuesday speech. The assembly included leaders from highly vulnerable nations and islands around the world that are suffering drought, threats to water security and increased flooding that scientists tie to climate change.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

The Trump administration has fired numerous officials and scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and has rescinded environmental justice grants awarded to states, nonprofits and universities. The administration also shut down the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
In July, the EPA announced a proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards. These are based on scientific findings over decades that tie greenhouse gas emissions to public health dangers and serve as the basis for regulations under the Clean Air Act.
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called the proposal “negligence” that will “cause great harm to the American people.”
Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona faced the greatest extreme heat-driven health risks, according to the scorecard. These states have significant Indigenous and Latino populations. Previous reports have shown American Indian and Alaska Natives have seen the greatest per-year average increase of heat-related deaths, and outdoor workers are disproportionately Black and Latino.
Arizona and California had the poorest air quality, most likely driven by ground-level ozone, wildfire smoke and dust, the researchers said. They used the federal air quality index, which estimates levels of five main air pollutants, to score the states on air quality.
Alaska and Hawaii ranked highest in air quality. Alaska’s low population density contributed to its score, while Hawaii, situated in the Pacific Ocean, benefits from winds that disperse air pollutants, the authors wrote.

(Logos)The union representing workers at Rhode Island’s ABC affiliate is urging a boycott of the station and its NBC counterpart to pressure new operator Sinclair Inc. to keep the two channels separate after it recently acquired ABC6’s non-license operations.
Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which already owns NBC 10 (WJAR), took over the infrastructure and operations for ABC6 (WLNE) on Sept. 12, putting the Maryland-based media company known for its conservative political content in control of two of the three TV stations covering Rhode Island and parts of Southeastern Massachusetts. CBS affiliate WPRI-12 is owned by Nexstar Media Group.
WLNE’s acquisition by Sinclair came as 20 unionized station employees organized under the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians of the Communications Workers of America in March 2024 were negotiating their first contract with Standard Media Group.
The union is calling on Sinclair to invest more in the station, rather than make cuts as it has done in other markets. 
“Viewers deserve journalism that is supported and invested in, not stripped for parts,” the union said in a press release. 
The union also demands Sinclair offer those it has laid off the ability to return, such as fan-favorite meteorologist Kelly Bates. Bates, who previously worked for NBC10, said ABC6 staff were alerted about the local market share agreement between Sinclair and Standard Meida during a staff meeting Sept. 11.
“I asked if everyone was going to walk out of here with a job and they said no,” she said in an interview Friday with Rhode Island Current. “Then they ended the meeting and told me I needed to come upstairs.”
Bates said she was told her position was redundant, which she said was puzzling as the initial statement from Sinclair “committed to producing distinctive content.”
“If you’re maintaining two distinct voices as they claim, then how am I redundant?” she said.
Jessica Bellucci, a spokesperson for Sinclair, did not respond to request for comment Friday.
Bates also worries what market consolidation will mean for the quality of news Rhode Island TV viewers receive.
“When you drop a source of information, it makes you less informed,” she said. “When these large corporations are buying these small stations, they lose their sense of community.”
Also off the job at ABC6 following the acquisition is sports reporter Nick Coit, who announced his departure from the station on Facebook Sept. 12. Daytime meteorologist Tyler Hughes, who joined the station in June, confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday he is no longer at the station.
The Boston Globe has reported that WJAR eliminated nine jobs from its master control department, the final point before a station’s signal is transmitted over the air. 
To show support for workers across both stations, the union is asking viewers to call NBC 10 General Manager Vic Vetters and support workers and local programming. Public figures are being asked to decline interview requests from Channel 10 or Channel 6, and for advertisers to shun the stations. 
Vetters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sinclair owns and operates 182 television stations nationwide, including 25 NBC and 39 ABC affiliates. It entered the Providence-New Bedford market in 2014 when it bought WJAR after the station’s former owners, Media General, merged with another company.

Lindell has been accused of domestic violence; admitted to filing a “fake bankruptcy”; has made and lost fortunes; claimed to have spent 14 days awake on cocaine before his drug dealers staged an intervention; and once made a $5 million challenge to anyone who could disprove his claim that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump, only to have a computer programmer meet the challenge, leading to years of litigation.
Lindell’s current financial status is mostly opaque because his companies are private. He’s acknowledged financial struggles, both personal and corporate. He’s blamed the money issues on being “canceled” by mainstream media and retailers for his close ties to Trump.
The Strib reports that “Lindell is on the hook for $2.3 million, pending appeal, following a defamation verdict related to his election-fraud claims. He said in testimony during that case he is $10 million in debt.”
If the second Trump presidency has brought him financial relief and he can put up money for the campaign, he could become a top-tier contender for the Republican nomination for governor given his name recognition and daily production of media content selling himself and his products.

During the Idaho Legislature’s Legislative Council meeting Friday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, legislative leaders said they will convene the 2026 legislative session Jan. 12 and hope to adjourn for the year March 27, though there is no official deadline to end the session.
If they hit the nonbinding adjournment target, the legislative session would run 74 for days, which would be the shortest session since 2014.
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said he expects the session to be short because of budget cuts and the 2026 election, where all 105 seats in the Idaho Legislature will be up for election. 
“Generally, when we have years like this where the budgets are tight we’ll get things done faster because we don’t fight amongst ourselves as much,” Moyle said. “There’s nothing to fight over. So hopefully we can move that date up. This is an election year, and I assume that everybody around this table is going to be a target of somebody.”
High-stakes party primary elections take place in May, and legislators generally look to wrap up legislative sessions early in election years so they can return to their districts and campaign.

 Revenues are lagging behind projections in the state budget

State budget and revenues are also likely to be a major issue during Idaho’s 2026 legislative session. 
Through the first two months of the current fiscal year 2026, state revenues have come in $22.6 million, or 2.8%, below the state’s revised forecast.
The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Idaho Legislature cut state revenues by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for eligible expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money state officials have to spend in the state budget, and the Idaho Constitution prohibits expenses exceeding revenues. 
Taxes are the largest source of state revenue in Idaho. 
Idaho state revenues continue to lag behind budget projections

To prevent a budget deficit, Gov. Brad Little announced that all state agencies – other than public schools – must cut 3% from their budgets in the current fiscal year. Little then made the 3% budget cuts permanent moving forward. 
Aside from the revenue shortfall and budget holdbacks, there are still other unresolved budget questions. 
There are about $109 million in general fund supplemental funding requests for the state of Idaho’s current fiscal year 2026 budget, said Keith Bybee, division manager for the Idaho Legislative Services Office’s budget and policy division. 
The Idaho Legislature gets the final say on supplemental budget requests, which will be discussed during next year’s session.
Additionally, Idaho’s latest revenue and budget projections do not take into account the cost of conforming to the tax changes made in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. 
“This is going to be an interesting year, because we’re going to be in a year where we’re going to be reducing budgets, and probably will be reducing taxes too because of some of the federal implications with the Big, Beautiful Bill,” Moyle said.
The nonprofit Tax Foundation estimated it could cost Idaho $167 million to conform to tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those tax changes include no tax on workers’ tips and no tax on workers’ overtime.
Because of the cost of revenue shortfalls, the supplemental funding requests and the cost of implementing the federal tax changes, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said the state could be facing a potential budget deficit of $200 million or more.
“This is not a disaster on the horizon; this is a disaster right now,” Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month.

PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillett announced her resignation last Friday after facing several legal challenges to her leadership from utility companies along with calls for her removal from Republican state lawmakers. Her departure leaves the authority with just two sitting members — Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron — less than half of its statutory size of five.
Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to name Gillett’s successor as chair of PURA, and his promise to lawmakers to fill the remaining vacancies at the authority by the end of this year now faces even more urgency.
“I need some folks with really strong analytical capabilities,” Lamont said earlier this week, adding that recent headlines and turmoil swirling around the agency had complicated his recruiting effort. “People are worried about lawsuits and impeachment, so there’s some hesitancy. But we’re going to get it done as soon as we can.”
“It’s not for lack of will, it’s just trying to get the right person there,” he added.
The shakeup also opened new questions about whether PURA, with just two members, can vote and issue final decisions on rate cases or other pending matters. Currently, the authority is scheduled to issue final decisions later this year in three major cases: requests to raise utility rates by United Illuminating and Yankee Gas, as well as a proposed sale of the Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
While Gillett initially announced that her resignation will take effect on Oct. 10, she later agreed to recuse herself from those pending cases after facing pressure from utility officials to do so.
A spokesperson for PURA did not respond to requests for comment this week.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for the governor’s office, called the issue “a bit of a gray area.” Lamont’s staff have sought additional clarification on the law from the Attorney General’s office, he said, but are operating under the presumption that three members are needed for a quorum and that the governor will have to appoint at least one new member by Oct. 10. 
A spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong’s office said Thursday it has yet to weigh in on the matter. 
Representatives of both of the major utility companies with cases before PURA, meanwhile, urged the authority’s remaining members to resolve those matters through negotiated settlements that could make the questions around the quorum issue moot.
“The conduct of agency leaders, including the chair, remain significant issues in Connecticut state courts,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in statement. “The circumstances of the past few days are unique and are unfolding as critical decisions affecting gas, water, and electric customers are being adjudicated before the agency. It is important that this work continues. We are ready to collaborate and discuss resolutions to these matters, including negotiated resolutions, in order to avoid additional litigation and to move the state forward.” 
In addition to its electric utility, Eversource owns both the Yankee Gas Company and Aquarion Water Company. 
Cheryl Kimball, an attorney representing United Illuminating, made a similar plea during oral arguments in the company’s pending rate case on Thursday. The arguments were heard by the two remaining commissioners, Arconti and Caron.
“This is a significant factor counseling toward a consensus resolution,” Kimball said. “If there is a consensus resolution, there is no appeal and the questions on quorum are avoided.”
UI’s request for a $105 million rate increase is currently at the front of PURA’s pending docket. Before Gillett’s resignation, the authority released a draft final decision on UI’s request that would instead increase the company’s revenues by $28.6 million.
In response, UI’s Chief Executive Frank Reynolds publicly warned that PURA’s proposal could force the company to cut its investments in the local electric grid, resulting in worse reliability and longer outages during storms. In a filing with PURA, the company also said it would have to lay off 71 employees due to the loss of revenues.
During arguments on Thursday, Kimball went even further to attack the authority’s proposal, which she said was “fully compromised” by Gillett’s leadership. “Signing off on any part of this decision will simply buy PURA more new litigation,” Kimball said.
In order to avoid such an outcome, Kimball said the company was willing to negotiate a one-month extension to PURA’s Nov. 1 deadline to issue a final decision on the rate case to allow for more time to reach a settlement. A UI spokeswoman said Friday the company planned to file a motion for such an extension as soon as next week that would allow the utility to collect any new rates retroactively.
If no extension is agreed to or PURA does not issue a final decision in the rate case, then UI’s original request for a $105 million increase would take effect on Nov. 1, according to the spokeswoman, Sarah Wall Fliotsos.
Such an increase would raise utility bills for UI customers by almost 10%, according to estimates from the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which represents utility customers before PURA. 
The head of that office, Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman, said on Thursday that she was open to having discussions with UI and other interested parties — which include the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and cable companies that utilize UI’s utility poles — about a possible extension. Absent such an agreement, however, she said the remaining two commissioners still have the power to render their own decision. 
“In the face of all then noise around this decision, we’re hoping that the authority is able to focus on the legal standards and the evidence,” Coleman said. 
In additional to the UI rate case, PURA is also considering Yankee Gas’ request to increase revenues by $192 million, or more than 26%. That is the largest such request by any gas company in the state over the last two decades, according to PURA.
In a draft decision released days after Gillett announced her plans to step down, the authority instead proposed a more modest increase of $41.5 million, or about 5.7%.
Ratliff, the Eversource spokeswoman, said in statement that the company is continuing to evaluate the proposed decision. 
“It’s our obligation and responsibility to make sure that the system remains safe and reliable, and in order for that quality of service to continue, we must be able to make the necessary investments,” she said. “Certain aspects of this rate decision hinder our ability to continue to provide the same level of service.”
PURA has yet to issue a draft decision on the third major pending utility case involving the proposed sale of the Aquarion Water Company. Critics of the sale, including Tong and the Office of Consumer Counsel, argue that the sale could result in higher water rates for the utility’s 685,000 customers in Connecticut.
Those cases included thousands of pages of briefs, public comments and financial documents submitted by the utilities and other interested groups.
Gillett’s departure has also renewed criticism of Lamont’s decision to avoid making additional appointments to PURA during her tenure.
Lamont appointed Gillett in 2019 and since then has made one additional appointment, Arconti, to fill the seat left by the retirement of former Democratic Commissioner Jack Betkoski. Caron, the board’s only Republican, is serving out a term that formally expired in 2022.
“We’ve reached a point where that authority can no longer operate, and electric rates are no lower, and in fact they are higher than they’ve ever been,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. “And I think a lot of this is by the governor’s own doing.”
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, who co-chairs the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, said he was unsure whether the law would allow PURA to operate with just two appointed commissioners.
But Steinberg was also an ardent support of Gillett’s leadership, and he said that her loss had “effectively hobbled” the authority. 
“I don’t like the look of it,” Steinberg said. “With decisions that are as important as the ones before them, I don’t think with only two commissioners we are looking at the kind of accountability that Connecticut residents are counting on.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GILLETT-HEARING-0220-01-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Next week, Judge Daniel Green will decide if it is a ball or a strike.
Last Friday, Green ordered Hoskins to rewrite the ballot language approved by lawmakers after finding it was “insufficient and unfair” because it failed to mention the amendment would repeal abortion rights. 
In his ruling, Green wrote that the original ballot title “fails to adequately alert voters that it would eliminate” the constitutional right to reproductive health care that Missourians approved last fall.
Under a law passed this year and upheld this week by Green, Hoskins had seven days to submit his revisions. Now, the two sides in the case have three days to submit analysis.
If Green rules Hoskins failed, he will have five days to try again.
The new ballot language written by Hoskins states in full: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and
miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Amend Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allowing abortions for
medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; and
Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

The reproductive rights amendment that Missourians narrowly approved last fall legalized all abortions up until the point of fetal viability. Access to the procedure remains limited as Planned Parenthood affiliates have sued the state over a series of abortion regulations that remain on the books. 
“My main focus has been protecting Missouri’s families and the Constitution,” Hoskins said in a statement Friday. “This ballot title and language reflects my commitment to upholding the values Missourians hold dear. My office remains dedicated to ensuring voters are presented with clear and accurate information as they consider this important measure.”
The ACLU of Missouri, which is leading the case challenging the ballot language, did not respond to a request for comment.

Green also told Hoskins to rewrite the “fair ballot language” summary posted to the secretary of state’s website, calling the old language misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases.
Hoskins’ new summary states that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors. 
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
After the Republican supermajority of legislators voted in May to put the amendment on next year’s ballot, the ACLU of Missouri sued, arguing that the ballot language was unfair and that the amendment illegally included unrelated subjects to be used as “ballot candy.”
Green in his ruling last week concluded that lawmakers did not err in combining bans on gender-affirming health care for minors with reproductive rights.

Scanlan, shown here on Oct. 29, 2024, said New Hampshire state law does not allow the voter registration list to be shared with a federal department. (File photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is suing New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, arguing he is illegally withholding the state’s voter file from federal officials. 
In a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, federal attorneys say Scanlan is violating the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by not turning the voter file over to the federal government. The department argues it needs the file to ensure that New Hampshire is carrying out necessary maintenance of the list to prevent voter fraud. 
The department is also suing California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania over the same request for the voter file. 
Scanlan has refused to hand over the state’s voter registration list. In a letter to the federal Department of Justice in June, Scanlan said New Hampshire state law does not allow the list to be shared with a federal department.
“New Hampshire law authorizes the Secretary of State to release the statewide voter registration list in limited circumstances not applicable here,” Scanlan wrote in the June letter.
He referred to RSA 654:31, the state law that allows the list to be given out to political parties, political committees, or candidates for elected office, upon request.
“That said,” Scanlan continued, “each municipality’s public checklist can be obtained from their respective supervisors or clerks.”
After federal officials again asked for the list, Scanlan sent a second letter on Aug. 28 that reiterated the arguments of the first.
In the lawsuit, Trump administration lawyers note that HAVA requires each state to have provisions in its election system “to ensure that voter registration records in the State are accurate and are updated regularly.” The Department of Justice is empowered to enforce that, which can include requesting the voter file, they argue. 
They also point to an unusually low percentage of duplicate registrations in New Hampshire, according to the “Election Administration and Voting Survey 2024 Comprehensive Report.” New Hampshire identified 0.1% of registrations as duplicates, and the national average was 12.7%, the lawsuit notes. 
The lawsuit asks the federal court to “declare that any state law that prohibits Secretary Scanlan from providing the requested statewide voter registration list is preempted by federal law,” and to order Scanlan to comply.
“The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is tasked with ensuring that states conduct voter registration list maintenance to prevent the inclusion of ineligible voters on any state’s voter registration list for federal elections,” the lawsuit states. “This action seeks to remedy the State of New Hampshire’s violations of federal voting laws.”
Neither Scanlan nor the New Hampshire Department of Justice commented on the lawsuit Friday. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State’s Office, Anna Sventek, confirmed that the office had received the lawsuit but said Scanlan would not comment further. 
Michael Garrity, director of communications for the Department of Justice, had a similar message. “We have received the complaint and are reviewing it,” he said Friday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5328-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Weston County voters want more exclusive representation in the Legislature, but several court cases have said otherwise. 
The post Lawmakers hear pitch on redrawing Wyoming’s legislative districts to give rural counties more say in the statehouse appeared first on WyoFile .","NEWCASTLE—Last year, Weston County attempted to send additional lawmakers to the Wyoming Legislature under the theory that one of the state’s least populated counties was underrepresented in the statehouse.
That effort didn’t succeed directly, but it did spur more discussions on the issue of rural representation, culminating Thursday in a group of Weston County voters making their pitch to lawmakers for redrawing the state’s legislative maps to adhere to county lines. 
County residents offered a variety of solutions, from weighted votes to dramatically expanding the number of lawmakers. But their message was similar: the state’s most rural communities need a bigger voice.
“It makes all the difference in the world to have someone from your county that knows your school boards, knows your sanitation issues, knows your local hospital district issues,” local resident William Curley told the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Reapportionment Committee. 
Since Wyoming’s legislative districts were redrawn in 2022 following the last census, Curley, an attorney, has led the charge for Weston County, with a population of fewer than 7,000 residents, to have its own senator and representative. Right now, Weston County’s four legislators also represent varying portions of Campbell, Crook, Goshen and Niobrara counties. 
“It’s got to be a hard job for a senator to represent more than one community of interest in Wyoming at the same time, equally on all things,” Curley told the committee. 
Curley and other supporters point to the Wyoming Constitution, which states, “each county shall constitute a senatorial and representative district” and each “county shall have at least one senator and one representative.” 
A legal challenge, however, upended that requirement in 1991 when a federal court ruled that Wyoming’s legislative maps violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution — also known as “one person, one vote.”
Since then, the Legislature has shifted away from strict adherence to county boundaries and toward population. While the approach has held up — including against a 2012 legal challenge — supporters of county-aligned legislative districts contend it’s costing rural voters their say.
They presented several proposals to the committee Thursday to shift back to county maps, including weighted voting in the Legislature as well as both reducing and expanding the number of lawmakers. 
While several proposals attempted to take the Equal Protection Clause into account, some residents actively pushed back on the legal rule that one person’s voting power ought to be roughly equivalent to another person’s within the same state. 
“Why should somebody that lives in an apartment in Cheyenne be able to run just as much as this state as a rancher out here that’s got 5,000 acres that’s paying probably 10 times the property tax that that person in there is?” Danny Bau asked the committee. “Where’s his representation?”
How we got here 
Weston County commissioners passed a resolution in April 2024 declaring two legislative vacancies in an attempt to redress their concerns regarding the absence of lawmakers representing their county alone. 
At the time, supporters of that movement said they expected other rural counties to follow their lead, including those that also lack exclusive representation in the statehouse. That includes Big Horn, Carbon, Crook, Hot Springs, Johnson, Niobrara, Sublette and Washakie counties. None ultimately did so. 
Following the resolution, the Weston County commissioners voted in October to select Curley and Karl Lacey to fill the seats they’d declared vacant, according to Newcastle’s News Letter Journal. 
The Wyoming Republican Party backed the process, but without a corresponding legal challenge, it failed to go any further. Meantime, the Wyoming Legislature passed Senate File 174, “Constitutional apportionment of legislators.” 
The new law created the subcommittee and requires lawmakers to study the topic of county-aligned legislative districts. It calls on the committee “to conduct meetings around Wyoming to take input on apportionment options from members of the public and other interested stakeholders.”

Newcastle meeting
Thursday marked the committee’s first meeting.
“I would like to thank you for providing this nice, calm venue to discuss this and not being right after a census and taking the time to do research and talk to us,” Tricia Baumann, another local resident, told the committee. “It’s really appreciated.”  
Baumann presented lawmakers with what she called a “population-adjusted legislative apportionment” that would rely on lawmakers using a weighted voting system in Cheyenne. 
Under the proposal, the state’s least populated county, Niobrara County, would have one representative in the House with a quarter vote on the floor. 
“Our point is the Niobrara citizens now have a person from their county sitting in Cheyenne speaking for the commissioners, speaking for the courthouse of Niobrara, speaking for the citizens of Niobrara, but understandably can’t put a lot of weight into the floor vote because their population is so small,” Baumann said. 
In all other aspects of the Legislature — including in committee meetings where bills must get approval to move forward — all lawmakers would have equal footing despite the size of the population they represent.  
More populated counties would elect more than one lawmaker in at-large races, meaning voters in places like Laramie and Natrona County would elect several lawmakers to represent the same area. 
That raised a concern for Torrington Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz. More specifically, Steinmetz worried what it would mean for voters living in the rural areas just outside the more populated areas. Such voters tend to vote more conservatively than voters in the nearby cities. 
“If they’re all at-large in Natrona County, what is to prevent Casper, the urban center, from electing all of the senators or representatives? Is there something in the proposal to address that?”
The proposal does not address that possibility, said Curley, who drafted the plan with Baumann. 
Curley pointed to another potential shortcoming of the proposal. 
“If you follow county lines, maybe it’ll be an issue with tribes under federal law,” Curley said. 
Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, represents the Wind River Indian Reservation. The district in Fremont County includes Lander, Ethete, Fort Washakie and parts of Riverton. 
“It captures all the places on the reservation and elsewhere where Native American people live,” Case said. “And so that was done very, very deliberately. Now, if all of a sudden that representation were based on the county line … there’s a potential for that Native American strength in their voting to be diluted.”
Case also pushed back more generally on the weighted-vote proposal. 
“Let’s go back to that example of Niobrara County,” Case said. If the county ends up with a representative with a fraction of a vote, “Are they really better off that way?”
Local resident Sue Mareles presented a second proposal to lawmakers called “The Founders’ Plan” that used a “formula” to determine the number of representatives and senators per county. 
“It is a nice hybrid plan that you don’t have a huge legislature and you also don’t have weighted voting,” Mareles said. “You have an individual — a whole person with a whole vote.”
Using Mareles’ formula, Niobrara County would have one representative, while the state’s most populous county, Laramie County, would have 11 representatives. 
The formula’s findings differed quite greatly from the legal memo and math completed by the Legislative Service Office ahead of the meeting. 
“If the smallest county—Niobrara with 2,467 residents at the 2020 census—was apportioned one senator, and each Senate district represented no more than 10 percent over 2,467 residents, the Wyoming Senate would need at least 213 members to meet the proportional requirements. The Wyoming House would then need at least 426 members,” the memo states. Currently, the Wyoming Senate has 31 lawmakers. The House has 62.
Mareles’ formula didn’t square for Case. 
“How is that fair in any sense of the way and how would that conform with the United States Constitution about having equal representation?” he said. 
Mareles pointed to a sentence on the last page of the proposal — “larger deviations require justification by legitimate state interests (e.g., preserving political subdivisions, avoiding gerrymandering).”
What now?
While the committee heard out voters, no lawmaker committed to any one proposal.
“I just want to thank all of you guys for how much hard work you’ve put into this and giving us so much to think about,” Steinmetz said. “And we may not come up with an exact solution tonight, but getting this discussion in depth is really good. And maybe it’s making you rethink some ideas, too.”
Steinmetz floated the idea of amending the Wyoming Constitution while Douglas Republican Sen. Brian Boner pointed to New Hampshire as a possible model for Wyoming to consider. Its chamber consists of 400 members. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, who attended the meeting, asked lawmakers to take the issue seriously. 
“Those are the real concerns that the people that I talk to every day are worried about, is the fact that our voice is diminishing quickly,” Neiman said. 
“So we’ve got to be wise about how we do this and how we respect those lines,” Neiman said. “Does the state of Wyoming have the guts to say we’re going to challenge the federal government on this because it’s hurting us the way we’re doing this? The way you want us to do this, ladies and gentlemen, is harming our state’s ability to be able to even function.”
The committee will hold another meeting sometime before its Dec. 1 deadline to provide a report to the Legislature. It had not been scheduled by publishing time.

Richard Blumenthal, who reintroduced the Kids Online Safety Act, called on Meta to release its research about youth safety risks on the site.","A U.S. Senate hearing earlier this month — featuring whistleblower testimony from former researchers at Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta — offered an opportunity for Sen. Richard Blumenthal to reactivate his campaign for the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill that would require social platforms to do more to mitigate harms attributed to the ways children use their technology. 
Blumenthal held a press conference in Hartford Friday, where he called for Meta to release its internal research about risks to youth safety and its parental safety tools. The remarks came two weeks after former Meta safety researchers testified to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law that the company covered up internal research that would have raised concerns about harmful effects on children of Meta’s virtual reality products.
“We are in the midst of a mental health crisis among young people that is aggravated and exacerbated relentlessly by social media,” he said, speaking outside The Village for Families & Children, which provides behavioral health services for children. 
Blumenthal has said his online safety bill, known as KOSA, would hold companies like Meta accountable and make more safety settings available on social platforms. “The research and the facts so far from these whistleblowers provide powerful documentation to the need for stronger measures for kids’ online safety,” he said.
While Congress is in the midst of a standoff over funding, Blumenthal said he’s hopeful for KOSA’s prospects once the funding issues are worked out.
But it’s already been a long road for the proposed bill. 
Blumenthal was first drawn to this issue in 2021 by another whistleblower — former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen, who leaked documents showing Instagram’s effect on the mental health of teenage girls in 2021.
He first drafted the legislation, with Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, in 2022.
Last year’s version of the bill, which Blumenthal and Blackburn cosponsored, passed the Senate handily in a 91-3 vote. A reworked version passed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, but Congress adjourned before the full House could vote, requiring the process to start over again. 
Blumenthal and Blackburn reintroduced the bill this May. 
The bill would allow addictive features and algorithmic recommendations to be disabled by users. It would establish what’s referred to as a “duty of care” requirement for tech companies to prevent harms to minors on their sites, and require annual independent audits of these risks. It would also create an 11-member bipartisan council of academics, researchers, parents, and young people to provide recommendations.
Opponents have argued the bill could lead to censorship and free speech violations. Some groups focusing on privacy and LGBTQ+ rights voiced concerns that kids would be cut off from support resources only accessible to them via social media.
The bill has been revised several times and has picked up support along the way from a range of tech industry leaders including Apple and Elon Musk.
Some initial critics turned around to support a rewritten version of the bill that tweaked who could enforce its “duty of care” provision.
NetChoice — a trade association that represents Meta and dozens of other technology companies — has called KOSA unconstitutional, stating in handout materials that the bill is “compelling companies to restrict protected speech” and arguing that “parents will be replaced by a council of big government bureaucrats.” The group did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
Others remain unconvinced, such as Fight for the Future, a digital rights group led by queer and transgender women. The group hired a billboard truck in June to criticize how KOSA could limit access to resources about reproductive health and gender-affirming care for kids.
Blumenthal said he expects the Senate to vote on the bill before the end of this year.
But pushing House leaders to hold a vote remains a challenge. Blumenthal said that he and Blackburn have meetings with House members planned in D.C. this week to discuss the bill. He said Blackburn is leading those meetings because her party holds the House.
He said he also hopes “allies in the White House” will press House leadership to hold a vote.
Speaking alongside Blumenthal on Friday, Laine Taylor, chief medical officer, said she supports the bill because she sees the negative effects of social media use in children she works with.
“There are lots of discussions around limitations being put on social media,” Taylor said. “So much of it is put on parents, and there’s only so much you can know.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9598-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges that on Sept. 4 and Sept. 6 of last year, registered nurse Brycen  Allen Meyer of Fairfax arrived for work at University of Iowa Health Care’s Urology Clinic while impaired by alcohol and/or “substances not prescribed” to him. The board also alleges Meyer engaged in “unwelcomed physical contact with another staff member” when he grabbed a co-worker’s wrist.

The board has charged Meyer with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
To resolve the case, Meyer recently agreed to a settlement that calls for him to accept a warning from the licensing board and to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, which assists individuals with substance abuse or alcohol issues.
Other Iowa nurses recently sanctioned by the board include:
— Licensed practical nurse Ecco Schwartz of Shell Rock, who was issued a warning and ordered to complete 30 hours of educational training on nursing documentation after being charged with failure to assess or evaluate the status of a patient. The board alleged that while working at an unspecified rehabilitation center, Schwartz improperly documented that she had administered medication to a patient that was actually administered by another nurse, that she “left treatments in two residents’ rooms,” and that she left a medication cart unlocked and unattended.
— Licensed practical nurse Kayla Waskow of Decorah, who was charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient, and engaging in behavior that was contradictory to professional decorum. The board alleged that in April 2024, Waskow’s employer, whom the board has not publicly identified, conducted a random audit of staff access to the electronic health records. As a result of the audit, the employer allegedly found that Waskow had accessed multiple patients’ records for no job-related purpose. Waskow allegedly admitted she had done so in an effort to track the patient census at her place of employment. The board issued Waskow a warning.
— Registered nurse Shawn Dale Friedrich of Peosta, who was recently charged with misappropriating medications or property belonging to a patient or clinic. The board alleges that in January 2025, Friedrich was found to have a variety of medications in his backpack, including lidocaine, bupivacaine, and other substances — some of which, the board alleges, had not been prescribed to him. According to the board, Friedrich stated he had taken the medications from kits in the emergency department that would have otherwise been discarded, and that any medications he ingested were limited to those prescribed to him. To resolve the case, Friedrich agreed to a settlement that calls for him to accept a warning from the licensing board and to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program.
— Registered nurse Regan Lind Cairney of West Des Moines, who was recently charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum. The board alleged that on Jan. 2, 2024, three individuals were transported to and cared for in the emergency department and intensive care unit at the Des Moines hospital where Cairney worked. The hospital later ran an audit to find out who accessed medical records for the patients after their arrival and found that Cairney had accessed records for two of them for no legitimate purpose. According to the board, she was fired from the hospital. To resolve the licensing board charges, Cairney agreed to a settlement that calls for her to accept a warning and complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.

Kay Ivey announced Friday afternoon that she will not call a special session to redraw Alabama’s State Senate map following a federal court ruling that the current map violates the Voting Rights Act.
“As the law currently stands, states like Alabama are put to the virtually impossible task of protecting some voters based on race without discriminating against any other voters based on race,” Ivey said in a statement released Friday. “I remain hopeful that we will somehow find the ‘magic map’ that will both satisfy the federal court and also be fair to all Alabamians. But as of today, I cannot justify the time and expense of calling a special session.”
The move could set up another confrontation over redistricting with the federal courts, two years after judges ordered the drawing of new congressional maps after finding the Legislature had violated the Voting Rights Act and later failed to come up with an adequate map to allow Black Alabamians to meaningfully participate in the political process. 
The ruling came out of a lawsuit challenging the state’s redistricting decisions in 2021. Messages seeking comment were left with the plaintiffs’ attorneys Friday afternoon.

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, ruled last month that the state could draw another majority-minority or near-majority minority Senate district in the Montgomery area. She outlined two possible scenarios earlier this week for her order to be upheld: a special session, or a court ordered map. 
Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the case, appealed Manasco’s ruling, citing the Supreme Court’s expected ruling in Callais v. Louisiana,  which challenges the constitutionality of majority-minority district.  Ivey also mentioned the case in her statement.
“In the meantime, I call on the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify the law in this area as soon as possible and relieve states like Alabama from this no-win situation,” the statement from Ivey said.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2023 upheld a lower court ruling — in which Manasco played a part — ordering Alabama to draw at least one additional congressional district that was majority-minority or close to it. The state Legislature that July approved a map that the panel called unresponsive. The state appealed but lost again at the U.S. Supreme Court, which led to a court-appointed special master drawing new congressional maps.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board will commit to reviewing cannabis advertisements within a five-day timeframe and give retailers more leeway to advertise on social media, among other changes, as part of the deal.

Vermont’s cannabis regulator will ease some of its restrictions on how retailers can market their products as part of a settlement announced this week with a cannabis dispensary in Middlebury and a statewide group that lobbies for the cannabis industry.
The deal resolves a lawsuit that FLŌRA Cannabis and the Vermont Cannabis Action Fund brought against the state’s Cannabis Control Board last December. The civil case, filed in Addison County Superior Court, argued that Vermont’s cannabis advertising rules infringed on retailers’ constitutionally protected rights to free expression.
A judge still needs to sign off on the settlement, which is expected to happen within the next several days, Dave Silberman, co-founder of FLŌRA Cannabis, said Friday.
The settlement “provides immediate, meaningful relief to an industry that has earned the right to be treated with respect rather than contempt, and avoids a lengthy and expensive trial,” Silberman said in a Thursday press release announcing the deal.
Existing Vermont law requires the Cannabis Control Board to approve advertisements that retailers have designed before those ads can run. That generally won’t change under the settlement, though the board now has a limited time window to do its review. If regulators don’t make a decision on whether an ad is permissible within five business days, the ads will automatically be granted approval.
The settlement also gives cannabis retailers more leeway to market on social media. They’ll now be allowed to advertise specific products on their feeds, provided the ads do not use images of those products. As part of the deal, retailers will also have to give the board a list of all of their feeds so that regulators can keep an eye on those posts.
Another measure in the settlement will reduce the frequency with which retailers have to get state approval for recurring ad campaigns, such as a weekly newsletter. Now, once the board signs off on a basic template for recurring ads, that approval will be valid for a year. That limits the possibility of a retailer needing to get each individual installment of an ad campaign approved by state regulators.
The control board has also agreed to develop a shorter version of a warning describing potential health risks from consuming cannabis that’s required to be part of retailers’ TV and radio ads. James Pepper, the board’s chair, said the current warning takes about 30 seconds to read, but the board is working on a new version, in conjunction with the state Department of Health, that could be read in five seconds or less.

Pepper said Friday that, overall, the control board is happy with the settlement and noted the changes would reduce some of the workload for his staff, too. 
“What we agreed to is actually, I think, a really common sense approach — a pathway forward that maintains the intent of what the (Vermont Legislature) wanted with respect to cannabis advertising, while reducing administrative burden, both internally and for the cannabis industry,” he said.
Pepper and Silberman said they expect to continue discussing changes to the state’s cannabis regulations with lawmakers when Vermont’s 2026 legislative session starts in January. All of the changes included in this week’s settlement impact how the control board enforces the state’s laws, not the underlying legal language itself.
Silberman said Friday that he and others in the retail cannabis industry are eager to eliminate the requirement that they submit their ads for regulators’ review entirely, a process they see as “blatantly unconstitutional.” He said he wants cannabis to be regulated like other similar industries, such as alcohol production.
“This is a top priority for the industry,” he said. “We do good for this state — and it’s time for the Legislature to recognize that, and stop treating us like we are a threat to society.”

(Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin) New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and the New Mexico State Bar say immigrant communities in New Mexico should be wary of a recent scam: Fraudsters who pretend to be immigration attorneys and contact people online. 
Torrez, in a news release Friday morning, said the office is seeing “rising numbers” of online scammers posing as legitimate lawyers. The scammers directly message people online via social media and may use the names and license numbers of real attorneys. 
“These scammers go to great lengths to deceive people, targeting immigrant communities seeking legal help,” Torrez said in a statement. “They use sophisticated schemes to gain trust and steal money.”

The fake lawyers are not only scamming people out of money, according to Torrez’s office. They have also reportedly given bad legal advice, causing some of their clients to miss appointments or hearings, according to the news release. 
Torrez’s office offered tips to consumers about detecting these scams. For one: Contacting individuals directly to offer legal services in exchange for money violates the state’s Rules of Professional Conduct. So any supposed lawyer reaching out directly to someone via social media “is likely a scam,” according to the news release. 
Consumers should also be skeptical of purported immigration attorneys who:

ask for money via gift cars, Bitcoin or apps like Venmo;
make an offer that sounds too good to be true; or
rush consumers to sign contracts or threaten them with deportation

Because the scammers sometimes use the names or license numbers of actual lawyers, the AG also recommends consumers contact the State Bar for help assessing the attorney’s legitimacy, or contact the named attorney directly. 
The office also released fact sheets about the scam in English and Spanish.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

(Screenshot from campaign ad)Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien is dropping his bid for governor after a turbulent week for his campaign, saying he doesn’t see a way for him to win the Republican nomination. 
Berrien, the owner and chief executive officer of Pindel Global Precision Inc. and Liberty Precision New Berlin and a former Navy SEAL, entered the race about three months ago, saying the state needed a businessman in charge and trying to compare himself with President Donald Trump as a way of appealing to people. 
His exit leaves two Republicans in the race: U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the highest-profile candidate, launched his campaign this week, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann launched in May. 
Berrien cited two reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week as his reason for leaving the race, saying they were “clearly targeted to force me out of the race.” 
“As a result of our politics today, I cannot focus on the issues I know will turn Wisconsin around. I have come to the conclusion I do not have a path to the nomination,” Berrien said in a statement.
The Journal Sentinel articles found that Berrien had scrubbed his activity on the online publishing platform Medium.com where he followed Jiz Lee, a queer, trans nonbinary adult film performer, along with other authors of sexually explicit essays. Berrien had entered the race boasting of his conservative values, including saying he’d “keep boys out of our daughters’ sports and locker rooms,” a reference to the issue of transgender girls participating on girls’ sports teams. 
The Berrien campaign attempted to downplay the news this week, but it quickly traveled across the internet, even garnering the attention of Jiz Lee, the Journal Sentinel reported in a follow-up article. They wrote in a post on Bluesky it is “okay to follow trans porn stars” and “to read articles about sex and relationships,” but that “what’s not okay is the hypocrisy of backing forceful legislation that restricts what people, trans and otherwise, can do with their own bodies.” 
“That is shameful,” they said. 
Berrien downplayed his online activity in his statement, saying he followed over 5,000 people across various platforms, subscribed to over 100 newsletters and has hit the ‘like’ button on 20,000 posts.  
“It was a major attack piece and we confirmed opposition research started in January of this year, if not earlier,” Berrien said. “And for what? For reading! Nothing illegal, nothing unethical and nothing immoral. Just reading. Wouldn’t you want your political and business leaders (and all of society, frankly) to be widely read and thoughtful and aware of different perspectives and ideas? Yet, when a supposedly major metropolitan newspaper condemns someone for reading, we have ourselves a problem.” 
The primary for the open governor’s race, scheduled for August 2026, is still about a year out. 
Ahead of the news on his online activity this week, Berrien had already found pushback to his candidacy from Trump-aligned conservatives because he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, including donating over $30,000 to her campaign.
Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman highlighted Trump’s influence  in the Republican primary in a statement about Berrien’s exit, saying it is a “lesson” for GOP candidates. 
“If you don’t show complete and total loyalty to Trump — past or present — then you better pack your bags and head for the door,” Shulman said. “His failure, despite his resume, financial investment, and doing somersaults to earn Trump’s love, shows just how far the other GOP candidates are going to have to go to win the nomination.” 
While the Republican field is shrinking, the Democratic field for governor is still growing with at least eight candidates in the race. 
Announced Democratic candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, former state Rep. Brett Hulsey and beer vendor Ryan Strnad. Others considering a run include Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes.

Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves, and Democratic businessman Darden Copeland each made six-figure loans to their U.S. Congressional campaigns, financial disclosure reports filed on Sept. 25 show. 
The trio’’ self-funding accounts for just under half of the $2.5 million raised by the eight major candidates from both parties ahead of the October 7 primary. 
The primary winners will face off in a December 2 special election to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who stepped down from his seat in July after winning reelection in November. The 7th district encompasses the northern and western third of Davidson County, portions of Williamson and Montgomery Counties and about a dozen rural counties. 
In the GOP primary 12 candidates are running, but Bulso, Reeves — both of Williamson County — state Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps are considered the frontrunners. 
Throughout the campaign, the four Republican candidates have made clear that they plan to back President Donald Trump’s agenda. The four have collectively raised around $1.7 million.
Candidates for the Democratic nomination in Tennessee’s Congressional District 7 special election participated in a Nashville forum on Sept. 9. From left, Rep. Vincent Dixie, Rep. Aftyn Behn, businessman Darden Copeland and Rep. Bo Mitchell.
The Democratic primary includes Copeland and Nashville state Reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell. The Democrats all want to serve as a check to the Trump administration and have been primarily debating who is best equipped to win the general election in a district rated as solidly Republican by the Cook Political Report, which provides independent, nonpartisan analysis of congressional elections.
Green won the past two elections for the 7th District by the same margin of roughly 20 percent. 
Collectively, the four Democratic candidates raised about $825,000.
As of Sept. 25, around 16,500 voters had cast a ballot in the primary election as part of early voting, which ends on Oct. 2. 
How the Republican candidates compare
The four GOP candidates can be broken down into two groups. Reeves, Barrett and Van Epps have each raised a significant portion of their campaign from individuals, while most of Bulso’s campaign is self-funded.
Van Epps has raised around $360,000, the most of any Republican candidate when personal funds are excluded. Reeves brought in around $270,000, Barrett $235,000 and Bulso $55,000.
Reeves and Bulso are neck and neck in terms of overall funds raised, with a total of over $550,000 each. Bulso has put almost $500,000 of his own money into the campaign, and Reeves loaned himself $300,000. 
How the Democrats compare
Copeland leads Democrats in total money raised at around $435,000. About $125,000 comes from personal loans, and the remaining $300,000 is from individual contributions. He has raised the most in non-self funds, but about a third of his money has come from out-of-state donors. 
Mitchell has raised around $200,000, putting in $10,000 of his own money. Behn raised around $150,000 and Dixie brought in $140,000.

The move will “bring financial stability” to the publication, which loses about $160,000 per year, the office said in the news release.
“Goldenseal is one of the state’s most prized publications, and we are excited to see it evolve into a publication that is free and accessible to all,” Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said in a news release. “For 51 years, the magazine has told stories of West Virginia’s people and heritage, and, as of this week, those stories — going back to its first edition published in the 1970s — are available online at no cost. This new platform also gives us the ability to add multimedia content and begin working with students around the state who are eager to contribute stories about our history and culture.”
She added that the new site will remove the paywall, giving readers free unlimited access to some of the state’s most prized traditions.  
“We look forward to sharing these treasured stories with a larger audience for years to come,” Ruby said. 
Ruby previously told West Virginia Watch the magazine, which was first published in 1975, had lost $640,000 in taxpayer money over the past five years because of declining subscriptions and rising postage and printing costs. 
The number of subscriptions has declined from its peak of more than 30,000 to fewer than 4,000 today, she said. 
Besides the new format, the magazine will also partner with universities and schools — beginning with West Virginia University at Parkersburg and Glenville State University — to increase content on the site. The student-written articles highlighting the youth of Appalachia will appear alongside pieces from the paid contributors who have worked with Goldenseal for years, the news release said.
Each year, a commemorative book will be published with print versions of the magazine’s content and sold at a price that will cover production costs, the news release said.

Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
Hegseth used the word “battle” to describe the massacre.
“Under my direction, we’re making it clear, without hesitation, that the soldiers who fought in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 will keep their medals,” Hegseth said in a video posted to social media. “And we’re making it clear that they deserve those medals. This decision is now final, and their place in our nation’s history is no longer up for debate.”
Defense secretary orders review of Wounded Knee Massacre medals

Hegseth’s predecessor during the Biden administration, Lloyd Austin, created a panel last year to review the medals. At the time, the Defense Department said “approximately 20” soldiers had received a Medal of Honor for participating in the massacre. Historians have noted that the records associated with some of the medals are incomplete or unclear.
There was no public report from the panel and no public action on the matter by the Biden administration before Biden left office. Hegseth held up a report in his social media video that he said was generated by that panel in October, but the Defense Department has not published it. A request from South Dakota Searchlight for the report is pending with the department.
“Upon deliberation, that panel concluded that these brave soldiers should, in fact, rightfully keep their medals from actions in 1890,” Hegseth said.
Hegseth alleged the prior administration was too concerned with being “politically correct” to share a final decision. 
Oliver “OJ” Semans, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member who advocates for the revocation of the medals, said he wasn’t surprised by Hegseth’s statements. Semans said he felt the review panel’s makeup was skewed toward protecting the military’s image.
“I think it’s a shame that Secretary Hegseth was misled by his predecessor’s report,” Semans said.
Past efforts to rescind the medals through congressional action have failed. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, introduced another bill to do so this year.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, was at a public event Friday in Rapid City, about 90 miles from Wounded Knee. Thune said the decision was Hegseth’s to make and that the decision was supported by an “independent review.”
South Dakota Searchlight asked Thune if he agreed with Hegseth’s use of the word “battle” and Hegseth’s statement that the soldiers “deserve those medals.”
“Whenever you’re talking about those types of events in our nation’s history, you need to do it in a respectful way,” Thune said. “I didn’t watch what he said, but like I said, I think the decision that he issued is the one that everybody will end up having to adhere to.”

The report suggests it will be expensive to implement the Medicaid work requirements included in the broad tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
Under that law, the 40 states plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act must require the expansion population – low-income adults under 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level – to either work or engage in other activities such as job training or higher education for at least 80 hours per month.
The law is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $911 billion over the next decade, largely because the new work requirements will push people off the rolls. The new rules take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.
Supporters say the work requirements will encourage people to get jobs that offer health care coverage. But critics argue that most Medicaid recipients already work, and that most people who lose coverage will be dropped because they fail to meet the reporting requirements.
In October 2020, Georgia received federal approval to test Medicaid work requirements for an initial 5-year period. Its program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, is available to people between the ages of 19 and 64, with incomes at or below the federal poverty level, who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaid. Georgia originally planned to begin enrollment in July 2021, but legal challenges delayed implementation until July 2023.
As of May 2025, Georgia reported that 7,463 people were enrolled, far fewer than the 25,000 the state had expected to enroll during the first year of the program.
Between 2021 and June 2025, Georgia spent $54.2 million on administrative costs, compared with $26.1 million on providing medical care, according to GAO. About $50.8 of the administrative spending went toward changing the state’s system for determining people’s eligibility and enrolling them. In addition, the state used $20 million it received under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to advertise the program.
Georgia officials told GAO that the pause in implementation forced them to do some things twice, raising administrative costs by between 20% and 30%. This included IT system changes, coordination with other agencies, and staff training.
“Every state Medicaid program is different, and so the amount or proportion of administrative costs that states may have to upgrade their systems and implement the new work requirements can vary by state,” Michelle Rosenberg, the GAO health care director, said in an interview.
“I suspect some states may require less administrative spending, and other states may require more. But I do think this is the best information we have available on what states’ experiences may be like.”
The Georgia Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia Pathways to Coverage, did not respond to multiple Stateline requests for comment.
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, one of the lawmakers who requested the GAO report, said it proves that Medicaid work requirements are a waste of taxpayer dollars.
“This report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,” the Democrat said in a news release. “If Republican politicians were serious about getting people to work, they would have closed the coverage gap nationwide and cut out the government bureaucracy.”

More than $1 million dollars of the water development funds had been designated for religious-specific education and enrollment of students at the College of St. Joseph the Worker, a college based in Steubenville, Ohio. 
“Said distributions are unconstitutional as they violate the establishment clause of the West Virginia and U.S. Constitutions,” Kanawha County Circuit Richard Lindsay wrote in the order Thursday.
Lindsay granted a motion for summary judgment to the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and the American Humanist Association, who filed suit in January against the Water Development Authority to stop it from issuing the grant to Catholic school.
The state’s Water Development Authority had approved giving $5 million to the Catholic-affiliated career and vocational college in 2024 to expand into West Virginia and to create a conservative think tank without a required recommendation from one of three state officials. The grant was first reported by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and the News and Sentinel. 
In the lawsuit, the organizations argued that in granting the money to the Ohio-based school, the Water Development Authority abdicated its duties of providing financial assistance to West Virginia communities to protect water quality and public health and encourage economic growth. The move also violated the guarantee of freedom of religion codified in the state constitution, they said.
In July, Lindsay sided with the ACLU and American Humanist Association, saying the Water Development Authority had violated the state constitution by giving the public money to the Catholic school.
The judge gave the Water Development Authority 30 days to show evidence of its compliance with the constitution, the ACLU said.  
The Water Development Authority has complied with his order, Lindsay said in a new order, prompting him to grant plaintiffs’ request for summary judgment in the case.
According to the order, the Water Development Authority grant money in question will now be used for “real estate acquisition, site development, construction, infrastructure improvements, supplies and equipment for workforce training.” 
In his order, Lindsay wrote that, “… as long as a state-approved grant is used for non religious purposes and is a benefit available to the public, said grant is constitutional.” 
In a press release, American Humanist Association Executive Director Fish Stark said the group still questioned the decision to offer state subsidies to religious schools.
“We’re satisfied that the court found the original grant unconstitutional and maintained that  state funds cannot be spent on religious instruction or sectarian advocacy in the future, even if the funding restrictions could have cut deeper,” Stark said. “This was always an affront to West Virginian taxpayers, which is why we took action when our members saw this blatant violation of church state separation happening in their community.”

Students at the College of St. Joseph the Worker earn a Bachelor of Arts in Catholic Studies while also receiving training in several trades, including carpentry, HVAC and plumbing. According to Lindsay’s order, a letter from the college acknowledged that the grant money wouldn’t be spent on religious advocacy of any kind or teacher salaries.
“No question of constitutional law or infirmity remains,” Lindsay wrote in the order.
The state’s Water Development Authority was created in 1977 by the state Legislature to provide grants and loans to local governments and public services districts for construction of water and wastewater infrastructure. The board also uses the funds for economic development projects across the state. 
Following Lindsay’s order, ACLU-WV Advocacy Director Rusty Williams said in a news release, “Tens of thousands of West Virginians lack access to clean drinking water, and it is  unconscionable that their tax dollars were intended to go to an out-of-state entity for purposes  that would have violated our constitution.”
“We call on the state to prioritize the needs of West Virginians, not the wants of religious institutions, in future decision-making,” he said.

LANL completed the venting of containers, releasing very little tritium according to state environmental officials. (Courtesy of LANL)Los Alamos National Laboratory and federal officials completed the depressurization of four containers that were potentially building up pressure, and released only a small amount of the radioactive gas tritium into the air, state environment officials said on Friday.
In 2016, LANL officials discovered the drums were building pressure, could potentially explode and, in a worst-case scenario, release tritium at a rate double the airborne radiation limit for the whole year. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear research. The EPA characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin, and is only considered hazardous in large quantities from inhalation, skin absorption or consumed in tritiated water — a replacement of one of the hydrogen molecules with tritium.
Instead, officials found the containers were fully sealed and intact, according to reports from the National Nuclear Security Administration to the New Mexico Environment Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which monitored the release. Depressurization was delayed several times by rain, and started on Sept. 16 and ended on Sept. 23.
“From the data we collected, received and reviewed, we really just don’t have any belief that there was any concerns for public exposure to the tritium at levels above background in the area,” Hazardous Waste Bureau Chief, John-David Nance told Source NM.
The NNSA reported total emissions to be around 0.005 millirems — much lower than radiation exposure of 3.7 millirems from a cross-country flight.
Anti-nuclear and indigenous groups criticized LANL and federal officials for a lack of transparency around the  plan to depressurize the containers and said their safety concerns were ignored.
The state required LANL to have a stricter “hard stop limit” as a nod to the concerns for exposure limits for children and pregnant women.
New Mexico Environment Department approves LANL plan to vent radioactive gas

NMED posted daily updates on social media about the release,  as Nance said the state wasn’t “exactly satisfied with LANL’s communications,” in the days leading up to the releases.
The NNSA and laboratory are required by state officials to issue a report about the depressurization and hold a meeting within the 30 days as part of the requirements from the state.
Nance said additional samples collected off-site by the New Mexico Environment Department will be released to the public in three to five weeks, after being verified.
“Recorded emissions we have were very low, but we’re are working to verify that with a third-party,” Nance said.

A friend stepped in to help, letting the family use her garden tap, but the experience has raised concerns about how prepared the town is to support community members during a drought.

A family of five in Northfield has been without running water for 12 days.
When the spring water they rely on at their home trickled to a stop on Sept. 9 because of the state’s ongoing drought, Kelly Murch said she started to call around for options.
And with three children — ages 2, 7 and 11 — it’s been “a weird time,” she said. Like living in “Little House on the Prairie,” a TV series based on a book about a 19th-century homesteading family.
At first, their neighbor helped them out by lending a large tank and his truck. With permission from the town, they filled up four times at the spigot in the community garden and paid $5 per round. 
Murch and her husband ran a garden hose from the filled-up tank through a window to a big old water cistern in their basement, which is working well thanks to gravity, she said, even though it’s “not very elegant.” 
Then, on Wednesday, the town turned the water off in the garden, Murch said.
Town Manager Jeff Schulz said he regretted that the community garden spigot had to be shut down. The town needed to cut the access due to fears of tampering or unintended contamination, he said, something state regulators say is a real concern. 
“We need to protect the water system and should not allow for limited and unmonitored access to the system without a policy,” Schulz wrote in an email. “Thus far we have provided that resident with about 400 gallons of water and we do very much sympathize with the residents being without water.”
Luckily, Murch and her family were able to turn to a community member and friend for help. On Friday morning, they filled up the tank at a friend’s yard in town. 
“I was really concerned initially,” said the friend, Sarah Eath, “because we didn’t know where they were going to get water from. And I was worried they wouldn’t be able to stay in their house.” She is glad now it’s “more of a limited water than no water” situation.
Murch and her family have to be very mindful about their water use, Murch said. They are taking their wash to a laundromat, though it is time-consuming and expensive; saving gray water from dishes for reuse; and taking really short showers. All of it is particularly hard with a 2-year-old who is being potty trained, she added. While they were teaching her to flush before the water shortage, now they are telling her not to.

In Northfield for four years, Murch is grateful she has the support of friends and neighbors. But she is worried about others, particularly older residents, who may not be as lucky and are without water during what is being called a historic drought across Vermont and the Northeast. She’s also not happy the town hasn’t been more proactive about informing residents about the drought, water conservation and options for potable water. 
Murch, who worked as a disaster response instructor with the Red Cross in Washington state before she moved to Vermont, said she is shocked the town doesn’t have an emergency plan for drought in place and hasn’t better informed residents about the ongoing drought. 
“Water is just so essential, you know,” Murch said. “It boggles my mind the fact that there is not an organized effort to go door-to-door and check on residents, or out-of-town people who don’t have water and don’t know what to expect because they haven’t been notified that there’s anything going on.”
According to Northfield’s All-Hazards Mitigation Plan, updated in 2023, the town does have a municipal emergency response plan but flooding — not drought — is the major focus. The 2023 document does suggest the town “should consider what, if any, actions should be considered based off best practices related to drought, mitigation, state guidance, and risk.”

Montpelier and Barre are among communities that have issued water conservation alerts as a result of the drought conditions playing out across the state. As of Thursday, almost 70% of the state, including Washington County, remains in a severe drought, and 24% of the state is in extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
“So really being smart about reducing water use is a really big thing” for people in the drought affected areas, said Ben Montross, drinking water manager for Vermont. This applies to residents who are not having issues now because they could potentially be affected too, he said.
The state has received 398 reports of drinking water supply shortages or outages, mainly from private homeowners, according to Montross, who said this is the worst drought he has seen statewide in 12 years. Of these, 77% of the reports represent shallow groundwater meaning a spring or a dug well and 20% represent drilled wells.
He urged residents on community water systems to pay attention to notifications and guidance posted online by municipalities. Those who don’t have running water could also let their state representatives know, he said.
The state’s drought database maps at least six water outages in Northfield affecting residents who have private wells, reported between Aug. 25 and Sept. 1. Four of them are fed by spring water, two are wells.
Schulz, the town manager, said he has only heard from one — Murch. He encouraged all residents to call the town if they are facing a water scarcity problem.
On the job for more than 11 years, Schulz said he has never faced a situation where residents in Northfield have run out of water. He posted a brief advisory Monday on the town’s Facebook page asking residents connected to the town water system to be “mindful and conservative” in their water use.
“Northfield is fortunate that its water source consists of three very high yielding ground water wells and the wells continue to produce at normal levels,” the post states.
The town will discuss a policy and procedure to sell municipal water to residents or businesses at the Oct. 6 utility commission meeting, Schulz said, and address measures to ensure the public water system, which is highly regulated by the state, is protected. They will also discuss an emergency plan.
For alternate options, Schulz pointed to “a well-known source of spring water on Route 12A that is accessible to anyone at no cost” and private water haulers, which cost money. 
That public source on Route 12A is hard to access with large containers, and it is also flowing low currently, according to Murch.
Fresh well water is also available from an outside spigot at the Capital City Grange, according to Merry Shernock, vice chair of the selectboard.
Meanwhile, residents facing water shortages have been stopping in to buy water jugs, 5 gallon buckets and larger water containers at a longtime hardware store in town.
“I happen to have a spring still going, but I’m hearing about (other) people having issues,”  said Ray Fernandez, owner of Fernandez Hardware.
“Some of the basic stuff you can solve your problem with at the hardware store. For the rest, you have to wait for Mother Nature or wait for the drill company,” Fernandez said.
That’s another hard-to-come-by option in Vermont, according to Murch. She said she called about a dozen different contractors that dig wells in Vermont and found they are booked out months, through next year. Many of them are in Massachusetts or New York.
When she was poking around to find the cause of the water stoppage, she came across the state’s drought resources page created by the Agency of Natural Resources. She found there was funding available for residents interested in drilling a well, but there was an application deadline.
“We missed it by six days,” she said. “But we didn’t even know there was a problem until there was a problem.”
State officials said the Healthy Homes program — which predates the drought — closed on Sept. 3. They pointed to the Department of Environmental Conservation’s On-Site Loan program that does not currently have a deadline, and some other options that could help Vermont residents with water supply repairs.

One of the cases involves Kristal Klaahsen, previously known as Kristal Lake, who worked as a substance abuse counselor at Manning Regional Healthcare Recovery from November 2014 through September 2020.
While working in Manning, Klaahsen was accused of engaging in several inappropriate actions, including pursuing a sexual relationship with a client, requesting a client to undress in front of her, and engaging in a relationship with a client’s husband.
A Board of Behavioral Health Professionals investigation allegedly revealed that Klaahsen had sent a client, identified in board records as B.C., several inappropriate and sexually explicit texts, photos and videos. The client alleged that toward the end of his inpatient treatment, Klaahsen began flirting with him and the two exchanged sexually oriented text messages and conversed on Snapchat. The client alleged that when he later learned that Klaahsen was in a relationship with someone else he became angry and relapsed.
On May 10, 2021, the board charged Klaahsen with making suggestive, lewd, lascivious or improper remarks or advances to a client. Klaahsen later agreed to voluntarily surrender her social work license and wait a minimum of one year prior to seeking reinstatement.
On Feb. 24, 2025, Klaahsen filed a reinstatement request with the board. On April 29, 2025, the board notified her it intended to deny that request. The board alleged she had not only engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, but also claimed, without elaborating, that she had engaged in a sexual relationship with a client’s spouse and had breached client confidentiality
On May 28, 2025, Klaahsen appealed the board’s notice of intent to deny her application for reinstatement and requested a hearing. She argued she had learned from her mistakes and was successful in her current employment as a hospital discharge planner and had received an award for efficiency, advocacy and excellence.
At a July 29, 2025, hearing on the matter, Klaahsen testified about the therapeutic process she has undergone and the progress that she had made since surrendering her license.
“However,” the board stated in its recent, written hearing decision, “when pressed, Klaahsen would not directly speak about her interactions with B.C. … Instead, Klaahsen placed blame on B.C., a vulnerable client, for her relationship with him, testifying that he was the instigator of their relationship and that she felt ‘obligated’ to send him inappropriate pictures.”
The board commended Klaahsen for her progress but added that it did not believe she had “adequately addressed the issues that led to the voluntary surrender of her social work license.”
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the Board of Behavioral Health Professionals include:
— Giovanni Demezier of Dyersville, who agreed to voluntarily surrender his license after being charged with unethical conduct, failure to comply with the national association’s code of ethics, and engaging in sexual activities or sexual contact with a former client. The agreement follows a board decision in May to issue an emergency order suspending his license.
The board alleged that in early 2024, Demezier, while working as a licensed mental health counselor “in and around eastern Iowa,” began providing counseling services to a patient identified by the board as “T.S.” The board alleges that the client-counseling relationship between T.S. and Demezier ended in May 2024, but before that professional relationship ended, the two communicated with each other on Snapchat, with T.S. indicating she wanted something “more” in the relationship.
Demezier allegedly responded that he would have to switch from being a counselor to T.S. to a “coach,” while indicating the two roles were “virtually the same.” The board alleges Demezier then had sex with T.S. in June 2024.
T.S. later became pregnant and believes Demezier is the father, according to board records. Demezier allegedly provided money to T.S. to terminate the pregnancy, but it was too late for such a procedure once she discovered she was pregnant, according to the board.
The board states that Demezier was interviewed and admitted to having sexual contact with T.S.
Court records indicate Demezier worked for Davenport’s QC Counselor at the time of the alleged relationship. Police records indicate T.S. provided police with screenshots of text conversations with Demezier that included references to sexual activity, a pregnancy, and the change in their relationship from counselor to coach.
Court records show that on May 14, 2025, police executed a search warrant at Demezier’s residence and seized a laptop computer from his home office. The laptop was then sent to Johnson County Joint Forensic Analysis Cyber Team in Coralville for forensic examination. No criminal charges have been filed in the case.
The Board of Behavioral Health Professionals also claims that in 2021, Demezier began providing counseling services to a different client, M.R., and made repeated suggestive and flirtatious comments to the client before transitioning from a counseling relationship to “coaching” relationship in August 2023. In October 2024, Demezier allegedly initiated a sexual conversation with M.R. via text message.
Demezier is currently being sued for negligence by Michelle Ross, a California woman who alleges that during their therapy sessions, Demezier disclosed information about his past and present clients, sent her late-night text messages, told her he was in “open marriage,” detailed his sexual activities and isolated her by discouraging her from maintaining relationships with her friends and family.
Demezier has denied the allegations. A trial-setting conference is scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025.
— Amanda Brune, who was recently notified of a board decision to deny her request to have her license reinstated. Board records show that in 2005, Brune, formerly known as Amanda Zwack, was accused of having close, personal relationships with clients and having sexual intercourse with one client while working for New Beginnings in Maquoketa and Clinton. The Iowa Board of Substance Abuse Certification subsequently revoked Brune’s certification.
In 2012, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Science issued Brune a license as a mental health counselor. In January 2014, Brune pled guilty to the criminal charge of tampering with records, a charge that the board says stemmed from allegations that she had billed Medicaid for services provided to a family member during periods she was seeing clients for her employer. Brune then agreed to have her counselor’s license placed on probation for two years.
In early 2015, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Science says, the board staff received an anonymous call asking why the board had licensed Brune as a mental health counselor when her certification had been revoked years earlier by the Board of Substance Abuse Certification. The Board of Behavioral Science then checked the IBSAC website, confirmed Brune’s certification had been permanently revoked in May 2005, and then revoked Brune’s license as a mental health counselor.
In March 2025, Brune applied for reinstatement of her mental health counseling license.

According to the ICE online detainee locator system, Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts is being held in the Pottawattamie County Jail. The database lists his birth country as Guyana, located in South America.
Des Moines Public Schools Board President Jackie Norris said in a message to the district community that Roberts, the district’s superintendent of more than two years, was detained by ICE Friday morning. Norris said in the message the board has “no confirmed information as to why Dr. Roberts is being detained or the next potential steps.”

Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will “immediately” take on the role of interim superintendent “until further notice,” the message stated, and he has the board’s confidence in his leadership. Smith formerly served in the role during the 2022-2023 school year, according to the message, after which Roberts was hired.
“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” Norris said. “The appointment of Mr. Smith as Interim Superintendent ensures that our District continues to operate at the highest level.”
Norris stated in the message the board will provide updated information once they receive and have confirmed it.
Roberts is a former Olympic Track and Field athlete, according to his LinkedIn account, and started his career in education in 2000. He has served in leadership roles at school districts in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.

(Photo credit: EPA)More than a month after a major industrial fire in Tangipahoa Parish, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released an inventory list identifying the millions of gallons of motor oils, automotive fluids and other petrochemical products at the site. 
The information was made public Thursday, hours after the Illuminator reported the agency was waiting on permission from the executives of the Smitty’s Supply Inc. plant in Roseland that was destroyed in an Aug. 22 chemical fire that took two weeks to completely extinguish. The explosion and blaze sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and a school. Petroleum products also spilled into nearby waterways, including the Tangipahoa River that leads to Lake Pontchartrain.  
Detailed on a 305-page spreadsheet, the list includes a variety of flammable and otherwise hazardous products. Rough estimates indicate Smitty’s Supply stored several million gallons of motor oils, lubricants, antifreeze, coolants, hydraulic fluids, gas mixtures, transmission fluids, methanols, drilling oils, solvents, acids, bases and other petrochemical products. 
With four locations across the South, the company bottles, packages and distributes bulk products to retail stores nationwide on behalf of major brands such as Shell, Pennzoil, Quaker State, Chevron and Castro.

Smitty’s Supply also makes and bottles its own Super S brand of petroleum products and, before the fire, had bulk storage tanks on site with 8.7 million gallons of capacity. 
Its Roseland facility, just north of Amite City, also housed a grease manufacturing plant, automated bottling lines, laboratory and testing facilities, three rail spurs, 36 rail cars, a fleet of 18-wheeler trucks and tankers, as well a printing, labeling and packaging line, and other operations across multiple warehouses, according to the company’s website.
The EPA had possession of the list for more than four weeks after obtaining it from Smitty’s Supply on Aug. 27 and initially refused to disclose it to the public. At the time and in response to a reporter’s subsequent requests, the federal agency said it needed to check with the company’s lawyers to ensure the list didn’t contain any “confidential business information” that would be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The law compels government agencies to share qualifying records with the public.
“Legal counsel for Smitty’s Supply provided EPA with an inventory list of the materials at the facility, which was used to inform response operations,” EPA Press Officer Edward Mekeel said Thursday. “The inventory contained off-the-shelf motor oil, antifreeze, degreasers, plasticizers, polymers, and paints. After confirming that the list does not contain Confidential Business Information, EPA is now making the list publicly available.” 
The agency did not immediately respond to follow-up questions sent Thursday afternoon.

DemasA budget framework for the 2025-26 fiscal year is in place, but now the tough work begins, with eyes on Tuesday to produce a final product.
Michigan’s Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday evening announced that they reached a deal to fund the government in a stunning turnaround after months of standoff and stalemate, signaling that the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate worked out their differences and could move forward to avoid a government shutdown.
But the clock is still ticking and, by the respective chamber leaders’ own admission in statements that flew across newsfeeds late last night, there is much work still to be done to hammer out that framework into a full fledged consensus budget plan.
The details of what might make the final plan were still elusive on Friday, even to some key legislators, as leadership on both sides of the aisle were keeping things close to the vest so as to not upset the agreement.

House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said as much in a news conference he held after session on Thursday, noting that he could not answer some important questions related to the deal because other key players were absent. Hall also noted that he didn’t want to say anything that might undo the progress made because it was still just a framework – which was atypical for the usually freewheeling speaker.
On the Senate side, details of the framework were also being closely held to vest, said state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor).
It was notable, too, that both the House and Senate held sessions on Friday but both were adjourned quickly without any clear new budget activity. A flurry of unrelated bills were introduced, instead, some with an appropriations focus but those were for supplemental funding to programs that already exist.
Still, the lack of a quorum in the House and Senate shouldn’t be perceived as an early exit.
Communications staff for the House GOP told Michigan Advance on Friday that legislators were still very much meeting on Friday to do additional work on the budget behind the scenes. That included conversations amongst themselves but also with their Democratic colleagues.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Democrats appeared to be fully engaged in those conversations, as well, working at the Capitol and in the respective chamber office buildings negotiating targets and what they might look like. That includes hammering out the details of the school aid budget funding K-12 schools, which is another piece of vital budget information being held closely behind closed doors.
It was a whirlwind of activity following a lot of sitting around for months, but the conversations were bearing fruit and moving along.
The buzz in Lansing was hopeful, and that legislators would have a final deal hammered out to present on Tuesday, Sept. 30, the last day of the current fiscal year.
Of all the twists and turns of Thursday evening, the emergence of a plan to create a wholesale tax on marijuana at 24%, expected to generate $420 million to go toward roads, was an unforeseen development. Proposals to use “pot for potholes” stretched as far back as 2013, and now the House GOP of the 2025 session appeared to be the ones ready to take that plunge.
The House GOP also celebrated its “waste, fraud and abuse” mantra making it into the final budget deal.
Michigan House GOP facing pressure over ‘ghost employees’, but leadership says it’s a real problem

For the Democrats’ part, there was barely a whisper of their supposed wins in the budget deal aside from the decoupling of Michigan’s state and the federal government’s business taxes, a move that would stave off some of the tax cut effects of the congressional One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
But one thing that was missed in Thursday’s announcement was the Democrats successfully protecting the statewide Medicaid exchange in the face of cuts from the federal government. Democrats on Friday touted that as another area where they won in the budget deal.
Another piece of information that caught the attention of those following the budget saga was a report from Bridge Michigan that noted interesting action from the Senate Democrats. The upper chamber’s leaders put forward an amendment on Thursday that would eliminate $500 million in annual funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which was Whitmer’s hallmark economic development engine through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
Bridge also reported that the House GOP put forward a bill to cancel corporate income tax deposits to the fund, opting to use that money toward roads.
Spurring economic growth has been one area that both parties agreed on, even if they differed on the concept of offering state taxpayer dollars as incentives for business attraction that might not bear fruit. The move on Thursday regarding the reserve fund was a sign that both Democrats and Republicans saw a clear need to shift money away from past priorities, and that the use of those state incentives to garner new business activity might be falling out of vogue.

Irwin, in a brief interview with the Advance, said he was still concerned that funding for education, health care and environmental protection could be on the chopping block to cover road funding.
“I haven’t seen the final numbers yet, so I can’t say, but it looks like those things are all going to be subject to cuts as a result of the shift of revenue towards roads,” Irwin said. 
While there will be other forms of revenue brought in to compensate for the increase in funding for roads, the rest will need to come from priority areas, and perhaps local governments.
“That’s kind of where it’s got to come,” Irwin said. “From some of those places. I guess it could come from prisons. … And so that’s concerning.”

Irwin was also critical of House Republicans’ plan to increase revenue by raising the tax on marijuana, arguing the effort would deliver less revenue than projected and would drive individuals toward the illegal market.
“When you drive customers out of the legal market, those are customers who are already contributing to roads, already contributing to K-12 schools, and already contributing to host communities. All of that’s going to be diminished by this action,” Irwin said.
As lawmakers met to solidify their loose deal, constituent and special interest advocacy continued on Friday.
In a news release from the pro-democracy Promote the Vote, the organization applauded the Legislature for getting to a deal, but urged lawmakers to protect election functions as critical infrastructure. The initial House GOP proposal included cuts to the Michigan Department of State and election administration.
Melanie Macey, the group’s policy and government affairs director, said those cuts would potentially threaten the state’s ability to run accessible, secure and efficient elections.
“They weaken election infrastructure and voter confidence, shift costs onto local governments, and would ultimately result in higher long-term costs,” Macey said in a statement. “The cuts would reduce early voting and Election Day support, damage election officials’ ability to provide required services, weaken voter roll maintenance and cybersecurity, and would have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable voters.”

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders officially called a special election Friday to fill the seat of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died earlier this month.
The Republican from Branch represented Senate District 26, which encompasses parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian Counties.
The special primary and general elections for the seat will be held on March 3 and Nov. 3 of next year, coinciding with the state’s regular midterm election schedule. If a candidate does not earn enough votes to win their party’s nomination outright, a special runoff election will be held March 31, 2026, the proclamation said.
State law requires that a special primary election be held “not more than” 150 days after a legislative seat becomes vacant, unless the governor determines it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
The candidacy filing period for the special election will begin on Nov. 3, 2025, and will close on Nov. 12 at noon. Following the primary, parties must certify their nominee for the general election by Aug. 5, 2026.
Three Republicans have announced their intentions to run as of Friday — businessmen Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, both of Paris, and former Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
Simon and Tritt originally planned to run for the seat of term-limited Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, who represents House District 46. Three Republicans and no Democrats remain in the race for Eubanks’ seat.

Tritt immediately criticized the decision to hold the general election next November — after the state’s fiscal session in April.
“District 26 deserves to have a voice in every decision that impacts our families, our jobs, and our future,” Tritt wrote on Facebook. “To go through a fiscal session without full representation is simply unacceptable.”
Both he and Simon said they oppose plans for a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, in line with Stubblefield, who was one of the most outspoken critics of the project since it was announced last year. Berry, a military veteran who declined to run again in 2024 after two terms in the House, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he felt it was possible to fund a prison while finding a more suitable location for it.
Both Tritt and Berry also stated their opposition to a potential immigration detention facility at the Franklin County site, after reports emerged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had visited the site Monday and were considering it as a place to hold migrants.
In addition to their positions on the prison, policy priorities for the three ranged from cutting taxes and protecting Second Amendment gun rights to helping rural hospitals, improving workforce development and education.

The case comes amid an outbreak nationwide. So far this year, more than 1,500 people have tested positive, the highest number since the disease was considered eliminated in 2000. Three people have died: two in Texas and one in New Mexico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
South Carolina’s four cases have all come from unvaccinated people in the Upstate who had no immunity from prior infections, according to the department. For privacy reasons, the state does not release how old patients are, where they live or their sex.

Two of the people who tested positive previously had recently been out of the country. One of the cases was a close contact infected by another.
Where the most recent case came from is unclear, the department said in a news release.
The person isolated during the infection to keep the virus from spreading.
This marks the most measles cases in South Carolina since 2018, when the state had an outbreak in which six people tested positive. Before that, the last measles case was in 1997, according to health department data.

The highly infectious disease can be fatal, especially in children. Symptoms include a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that usually lasts about a week. In severe cases, the virus can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, according to the health department.
Most children receive two doses of a vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella between the ages of 1 and 6, according to the health department. About 94% of South Carolina children began the 2024-2025 school year with all their vaccines, according to health department data.
That’s a decrease from recent years.
During the 2019-2020 school year, more than 96% of students started the year vaccinated.

If you’re in immediate danger, call 9-1-1.
The University of Utah’s annual campus safety report shows staggering on-campus rape statistics for a second year in a row. However, like last year’s survey, most of the allegations were reported during a single interview with a survivor.
The state’s flagship school accounted for 146 rape cases in 2024, with a former student reporting 110 incidents by a single partner during a “multiple-month relationship plagued by interpersonal violence,” according to a news release from the U.
“Because each is a distinct action, then each counts individually, so that we counted the full 110 which is what the survivor stated that they had,” said Todd Justesen, director of the U’s Clery program, a federally required initiative to disclose campus crime data. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the report released on Friday, the survivor didn’t wish to move the case forward, and both people in the relationship have graduated.
This year’s count nearly rivals the university’s 2023 report, which counted 175 rape cases. That year, a single victim also reported being raped 150 times by their intimate partner at the Salt Lake City campus. Both numbers are substantially higher than the 30 cases reported in 2022. 
Chris Linder, a professor and chair of the Department of Educational Leadership at the university, said that while the numbers may be alarming, they can also help other victims of interpersonal violence to report sexual assault from intimate partners. 
“But many survivors do not come forward and report it as sexual assault, because our culture has constructed the idea of sexual assault as a stranger jumping out of the bushes and snatching us,” Linder said. 
The university doesn’t have exact statistics of accountability in these cases, but a university spokesperson said the school will refer students to different offices depending on whether they’d like to press criminal charges or student discipline, like expelling or suspension while the investigation takes place. 
The report also shows a significant increase in fondling, or inappropriate touching of the groin, buttocks or breasts, including during medical examinations, Justesen said. Fondling instances grew from 55 in 2023 to 83 last year. That included 51 cases at the U of U Health Hospitals and Clinics. 
All reports are counted whether or not the allegation was substantiated and someone was found accountable, Justesen added.



Let us know what you think...


 


The report also showed an increase in other forms of violence. Cases of aggravated assault, which includes any attack to inflict severe bodily injury, tripled from seven in 2023 to 21 last year. That included 14 in health care settings.
The U. also released the results of a campus climate survey on Friday, which aims to understand trends, patterns and needs among students with a focus on sexual harassment and misconduct. The report shows high confidence in bystander intervention during emergencies and a strong understanding of consent in sexual encounters.
University officials saw a silver lining in those results. 
“As we compare our rates to national benchmarks across almost all categories, we’re seeing lower rates of incidents reported for our students,” said Lori McDonald, vice president for student affairs at the university, “the exception to that being among intimate partner violence, which helps us, again as a campus, know that we should continue investing and building on those resources.
The university offers a range of educational programs and events throughout the academic year to better understand healthy relationships and how to intervene in potentially harmful situations, McDonald said. 
There’s a peer wellbeing navigation program available for students, as well as sexual violence resources. Anyone needing help is encouraged to call the 24-hour rape recovery center crisis line at 801-736-4356.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Twenty minutes was all it took for state regulators to cement the seasonal electricity rates that will hike Rhode Island Energy customers’ bills by an average of $22.28 per month for the next six months.
But the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s swift decision Thursday does not preclude the prospect of more discounts on winter utility bills — proposals for up to $180 million in credits on winter gas and electric bills remain under review. In a nod to the rising utility costs — and frustrations of the customers who struggle to pay them — the three-member panel also kicked off a first-of-its-kind request for public comment on other ways to flatten the seasonal price spikes. 
Electric supply rates typically increase every winter, reflecting the regular, seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. But the cyclical rollercoaster has grown more dramatic in recent years because of global unrest and increasing demand for natural gas.
The 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour price that starts Oct. 1 is 16.05% more than existing summer prices. But, it’s nearly 10% less than last winter, and below the record high during the 2022-2023 winter. Little comfort to customers struggling to afford rising bills and to their advocates, many of whom blame Rhode Island Energy for profiting in the face of residents’ financial struggles. 
A winter of discontent? Ratepayers, advocates urge regulators to reject proposed utility hikes

A 206-signature petition submitted to utility regulators earlier this month stressed the contrast between residents “pushed to the brink by unaffordable rates” and the utility supplier’s profits reaching “new highs.” 
PPL Corp, the parent company for Rhode Island Energy, which reported a $183 million profit for the three-month period that ended June 30, including an $8 million quarterly profit specific to its operations in Rhode Island. 
But the Pennsylvania-based corporation’s balance sheet received no boost from the prices it charges for electricity usage in Rhode Island. State law prevents the state utility supplier from boosting its bottom line through usage costs, which must directly reflect the price from third-party suppliers — a point explained in detail by Ron Gerwatowski, commission chairman, during the meeting Thursday. And, state regulators cannot reject proposed seasonal rate increases as long as there is no evidence of extra profits for the company.
“We don’t have the authority to deny the cost recovery because costs are straining affordability,” Gerwatowski said.
He later concluded, “I think the decision is really simple for us. Did they comply with the procurement plan and did they do the rates correctly?”

Finding balance
Less simple is how to soothe the pocketbook pain that will come from the newly approved seasonal electric prices. Rhode Island Energy executives, and later Gov. Dan McKee pitched $154 million in bill credits over the next two winters. The credits, mandated to protect customers from company tax payments tied to its 2022 acquisition of the state utility operations from National Grid, were originally set to be distributed over 40 years. But proponents say concentrating the credits over the first three months of 2026 and 2027 — when customers’ utility bills are highest — would provide more meaningful relief. The discounts, which would slash electric bills $20 to $30 per month while cutting $40 to $50 from monthly gas bills, await final approval from the commission.
Separately, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources has proposed spending $5 million from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program to credit low-income customers in October through December of this year. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative revenue will result in a $45 million credit for eligible customers, according to McKee’s office.
McKee has also asked the commission to come with a scheme to yield another $25 million in discounts by adjusting some of the non-supply-side charges. Even before McKee’s public plea, utility regulators indicated they were open to some tweaks to minimize the “rate shock” that occurs each winter when supply prices rise. A July 21 notice sought public feedback on ways to reduce bill costs during “peak heating months.” The solicitation suggested condensing service charges that fund the company’s investments in energy efficiency,  storm recovery work and renewable energy into an eight-month period — excluding December to March — rather than the existing, 12 months. This would reduce customers’ bills during the period when prices are highest.  
In Massachusetts, state utility regulators and Gov. Maura Healey opted for similar workarounds, including cutting charges on energy efficiency programs to save $500 million for ratepayers. 
Environmental advocates criticized Healey’s decision as short-sighted, risking higher costs in the long-term as climate change worsens and natural gas becomes more unreliable and expensive. Rhode Island environmental and consumer protection groups were skeptical, too, of implementing similar tactics in the Ocean State.
“Rate and bill volatility are increasingly tied to the region’s overdependence upon natural gas for power generation, especially in the winter,” Tina Munter, a policy advocate for Green Energy Consumers Alliance, wrote in an Aug. 6 letter to the commission. “Overdependence upon natural gas is a fact that can and must be addressed by a long-term, steady commitment to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and demand response.”
Jennifer Wood, executive director at the Rhode Island Center for Justice,  attorney representing the George Wiley Center,  strongly recommended in a separate letter against letting Rhode Island Energy tack on deferral fees to make up for temporarily suspended charges. 
Noting that customers rack up debt for unpaid bills in the winter, Margaret Hogan, legal services administrator for Division of Public Utilities and Carriers — the administrative arm of the state utility agency — expressed concern that shifting costs to the summer would “further exacerbate already difficult collections.”
State utility regulators have not made a decision on which, if any of these approaches to take, awaiting more data from Rhode Island Energy. 
Pandemic debt repayment to end
Debt from unpaid bills is a problem for Rhode Island Energy’s balance sheets — rising more than twofold to $254.9 million as of May 2025, according to written filings submitted by the company — prompting the company to push to suspend a pandemic-era requirement that gave customers more time to pay overdue bills with lower upfront payments. In a separate, unanimous vote Thursday, utility regulators agreed Thursday to the proposal to end its March 2020 order — though not as early as Rhode Island Energy wanted.
The flexible COVID-era debt repayment option will end on Jan. 1, rather than the Dec. 1 expiration the company proposed. The vote mandates that Rhode Island Energy work with the 5,000 customers on the existing pandemic repayment plans to transition to other, permanent repayment options rather than risking shutoff.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, said in an emailed response Friday that the company was “committed to delivering safe, reliable and affordable energy.”
“We recognize that affordability is a significant concern and offer various programs and services to help customers save energy, manage their bills, and access financial assistance,” Dalo said.
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community winter electric rates, which take effect Nov. 1, have not been announced. About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

,DC,2025-09-26 18:59:05+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here's a guide for what to expect.,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-government-shutdown-nearing-heres-guide-what-expect,,"WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans. A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions. The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions. That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law. But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly. Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed. That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends. Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office. The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom. As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment. The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary. During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.” Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.” This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans. The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they're not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that's going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it's going to matter a lot to them. It's going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts? As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown. That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.  DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment. States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown? Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park. Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds. Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that's not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear. When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season. The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits. Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code. Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.“It's really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. What role does Congress have during a shutdown?The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.   Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.  Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn't expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year. Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends. Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session. Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.” “Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”",,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

She joined 3,200 other union members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who went on strike at midnight on Aug. 4 to get better wages and retirement plans (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).After a week of heated exchanges between the leaders of Boeing Defense in St. Louis and the union representing its machinists, the two sides have agreed to resume negotiations Monday.
“The bargaining committees for Boeing and IAM 837 have agreed to return to negotiations on Monday with the help of a federal mediator in an effort to find a path to end the strike,” said Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 in a joint statement Friday afternoon. 
The strike by more than 3,200 union members at Boeing Defense facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Illinois, reached 53 days on Friday. 
The union announced Friday morning it was aiming to ramp up support with a rally on Wednesday, as well as a meeting “soon” with union members and Democratic U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
Last week, workers voted to approve a union-proposed contract, after overwhelmingly rejecting Boeing’s previous two settlement offers.
The union’s four-year contract proposal includes a $10,000 ratification bonus instead of the $4,000 bonus Boeing proposed. It also addresses one of the workers’ biggest concerns of pay raises for top-of-scale members and 401(k) benefits, union leaders said.  
The union’s lead negotiator said the “ball’s in their court,” during a press conference Tuesday on Zoom.
“This union is prepared,” said Jody Bennett, IAM Union resident general vice president, said at a press briefing. “If they want to fly in tonight, I’ll stay up all night. We’ll work on weekends, but we’re here to get something that’s fair and equitable.”
Boeing fired back that their position hadn’t changed from the previous week, after they called the workers’ vote on the union’s proposed offer a “publicity stunt” and a “waste of time.” 
“It’s unfortunate the union led its members to vote on an offer that we didn’t extend or collectively bargain,” said Boeing in a statement Tuesday. 
The company accused Bennett of having “selective memory” on Boeing’s offers, pointing to his statement days before members voted down the company’s original offer in July that the agreement “meets the moment.” 
“We agree with him and remain open to constructive talks within the boundaries of our landmark offer for Midwest manufacturing,” according to the company’s Tuesday statement. 
The union’s proposed ratification bonus is lower than what the $12,000 Boeing employees in Seattle received last year after a seven-week strike, said Jonathan Battaglia, spokesman for the IAM Union. However, the 401(k) benefits are the same as those Seattle workers received, he said. 
The Northwest strike lasted 53 days, and the company ultimately conceded on some of the workers’ main requests. 
However, Dan Gillian, Boeing St. Louis vice president of air dominance, said in a statement last week that a contract in St. Louis has to “make sense in the Midwest, not the Pacific Northwest.”
Missouri Democratic Congressmen Wesley Bell of St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, along with members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, urged Boeing last week to return to the bargaining table. 
Soon after the joint statement was released Friday, Boeing posted a “mythbuster” video of Gillian talking about the wage growth in the company’s offer being “very real.”
During the press conference Tuesday, Bennett said Boeing has repeatedly expressed the company won’t veer from the parameters of its core offer, calling it a “sound offer.”
“However, our members are telling us that’s not the case,” Bennett said. “So we will meet Boeing, but without parameters. You know, the strike’s been going on now seven weeks. We may have to look at this as it’s a brand new negotiation. I would hope not.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2949-scaled-e1757539013206-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 14:57:15.852469

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa state parks and state forests will host volunteers Saturday for clean up and maintenance projects in celebration of National Public Lands Day. 
Andy Bartlett, the manager at Ledges State Park near Madrid, said the volunteer events are a way to celebrate public lands in the state, and they help with park maintenance.
Volunteer projects are different at each participating park. Ledges, for example, will lead volunteers to areas of the park that have been taken over by invasive species such as honeysuckle or autumn olive. Volunteers will be given equipment and taught how to remove the plants that would otherwise choke out native species.

Bartlett said Ledges has hosted similar volunteer projects and said each time volunteers are able to see the “immediate impact” of their efforts in the park. 
“By the time we’re done with the project, you have this whole different view of the forest, or the forest edge where we’ve been clearing,” Bartlett said. “It’s kind of satisfying for them to be able to see progress in their work and results immediately with one event.” 
Bartlett said he’s hopeful the Saturday event at Ledges, which begins at 10 a.m. in the Lost Lake Trail parking lot, will draw a crowd of around 50 volunteers. Bartlett said the event is also a “cash in, trash out” or CITO event that allows folks involved in geocaching to earn a virtual souvenir for attending the event. 

Public land owned by the state and managed by Iowa DNR accounts for approximately 1% of Iowa’s 36 million acres. This land comprises the state parks, forests, preserves, recreation areas and lakes that are open to public use. 

While volunteers will be using loppers and other tools to cut down the woody shrubs, Bartlett said there are jobs at the volunteer events in which the whole family can participate. 
Prairie Rose State Park, Lake Darling State Park and Lake MacBride State Park will also host volunteer events geared toward removing invasive species. 
Other parks are asking volunteers to help refurbish picnic tables, pick up trash and debris and assist with other infrastructure maintenance projects. Volunteers at Yellow River State Forest will help to prepare firewood for the forest’s fundraiser firewood sales.  
Bartlett said even one day of volunteer work can help parks check off the projects they haven’t been able to complete on their own. “Any help all of us as managers can get at our areas through volunteers is truly appreciated,” he said.
Specific information on time and meeting location can be found at the state park websites, or on Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ statewide volunteer day page. 
National Public Lands Day has been celebrated on the fourth Saturday of September since 1994. National Parks offer free admission on the day and like Iowa, coordinate dozens of volunteer projects. 
According to the National Park Service, the holiday is a chance for citizens to assemble with a common goal of “stewarding America’s natural resources for future generations to enjoy.” 
Bartlett said the day helps volunteers feel connected to their public lands. Sometimes, he said that means they even get involved with other volunteer events or groups that help take care of the parks. 
“Eventually, we’re creating stewards that not only give back to our park through volunteer labor, but they’re advocates for our park as well,” Bartlett said.

But not accepting that a teacher was capable of providing a “good education” to me or my brother because that teacher was Black was racism.

The flight back to Jackson that night in June 2023 was full. I was then serving as an interim pastor in the city after a lifetime away.
I had already boarded the plane and was settled into my seat when a young Black man in sports coat and tie carrying a huge trophy over his head came down the aisle. The trophy was at least four feet tall. About the time he got to my row, a middle-aged white man wearing a cord coat turned around and took the trophy and placed it in an overhead bin. They looked like student and teacher. Or maybe debater and coach. I had been on the debate team in high school and college. It had been a long time ago. But the wardrobe looked the same. 
He took his seat opposite mine on the aisle. Due to plane noise on the small jet and a chatty neighbor next to him, I didn’t have a chance to speak to him until we landed and were standing in the aisle ready to deplane.  
“Nice trophy.”
He won it that morning at a national debate tournament in Phoenix. He was beaming. He should be. I asked where he went to school. He said Jackson Prep. Wow. 
I was part of the Jackson Prep class of 1973. I never went to a national debate tournament. No one from Prep did back then. In college I had teammates who did. But I never went.  There were no Black students at Prep in my days there. The only Black people on campus then were the maintenance and custodial staff. 
Through the years my mother and I talked about changes that happened in Mississippi and the world. She would often end the conversation by saying: “But look how far we have come.” 
My parents were always concerned that I get a “good education.” It was a mantra for them. I think they meant they wanted my brother and me to develop critical thinking and communication skills. But it was otherwise undefined. 
When I was a public Bailey Junior High School seventh grader in 1967, I assumed I’d eventually be at Jackson’s flagship Murrah High School. A Murrah Mustang.

My parents took me and my brother to Murrah football games. They had awesome teams in the late 1960s. A neighbor played for the Mustangs and went on to Georgia Tech to play, or so I was told. I attended the student musicals at Murrah. My parents were friends with the principal and his wife. We had cookouts at each other’s homes along with other friends from church. That was the way it was supposed to be. But it did not last.
Things changed in the 1969-1970 school year. I’m not sure when I first learned about Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court case that ruled “separate but equal” for schools was unconstitutional. There was another case, Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, decided in 1969 that ordered no further community stonewalling. But it was a long time before I knew the name of that case. While it charted my path away from public Murrah High School to private all-white Jackson Prep, it was not a foreordained path. 
Talk about “good education” was everywhere in my white world. I recall my parents sharing their concern with me. They and their friends were concerned that the “new” teachers would not have the necessary skills and attributes to provide the “good education” they wanted for my brother and me. But most of these “new” teachers came from “other” schools. Schools where the students were Black. The teachers were as well. 
As a ninth grader at Bailey, I did not know about these court cases. I heard my parents and other adults talk about the “Court” but did not know specifics. The talk was that schools would be closed after Christmas break (never “winter break” in those days) for three weeks while some plan was drawn up for school attendance in the spring of 1970 and into the next year. There was even a chance I would not finish the year at Bailey. But I did. 
But the high school arrangement would be different. Murrah was paired with Brinkley High School, one of the all-Black high schools in the Jackson Public Schools. On the street where I lived, we said there were five high schools: Murrah, Central, Provine, Wingfield and Callaway. Those were the historically white ones. We didn’t count the “others.” Didn’t compete against them. Didn’t know anyone who went to them. Couldn’t have gotten to them by ourselves. Didn’t know the names of these schools.  So they did not exist in our little bubble of the world. 
But they did exist. Brinkley, Jim Hill and Lanier, schools created for the purpose of segregating Black students, all existed. There were real students who attended, real teachers who taught, real parents concerned about their children’s “good education.” 
I know that growing up my parents taught me the importance of respecting individuals for who and what they were. My father made a medical mission trip to the Eku Hospital in Nigeria in 1968 during the civil war there. My mother was deeply involved in the Women’s Missionary Union at Woodland Hills Baptist Church. They received and entertained missionaries from around the world. It was always understood that racial epithets, slurs and characterizations were not accepted in our home. 
But one evening a group of their church friends came over. A comedian/evangelist had recently spoken at church and sold copies of his LP album: Laughin’ With ‘Em. There was a second album too. My parents bought them. After dinner the guests gathered around the new Fischer stereo console and played the albums. The comedian spoke in dialect. The punch line of each yarn made fun of the Black folk in each story. Just like Amos N’ Andy. Everyone in the room laughed. I was listening from the hallway. No doubt I laughed, too. This form of racism was in the air we breathed and the water we drank on my street in the “Closed Society.” 
My parents were “good people” and respected “all” people. But not accepting that a teacher was capable of providing a “good education” to me or my brother because that teacher was Black was racism. It still is. 
The search for a “good education” took me afield from Mississippi. My parents did not want to give in to the private school bonanza that spread like wildfire in 1970. My mother stopped us from visiting her brother and his family in the early 1960s. She was disturbed by the racist reading material from the John Birch Society that she found everywhere at their house. But they were not prepared in any way for the tidal wave of change that broke in the wake of the Alexander v. Holmes decision. Good intentions and family disagreements take on a different meaning in the eye of a hurricane landmark court case.
Together we found the Darlington School for Boys in Rome, Georgia, where I attended 10th grade as a boarding student. Isn’t it ironic that to avoid going to a segregation academy, I chose to go to an all-white school almost 400 miles away from home?
There were a number of boys from Mississippi whom I met that year. I don’t recall talking about why we were there, though I am sure we did. And I would hazard a guess that it would revolve around “good education.” Of course. There were no Black students at Darlington that year. Irony abounds.
Once I went to the hallway bathroom eager to relieve myself. Standing at the urinal, I looked down on a photo of Martin Luther King Jr. I just left it there. I knew this racist act was wrong. But I lacked the courage to remove it. And I knew the Black custodian could be counted on to clean it up.
Most of my psychic energy during 10th grade at Darlington was used to figure out how to return “home.” Would I attend Murrah as I had always planned? Another option presented itself: Jackson Prep had emerged from the primal slough of the segregation academies. Or at least that’s what those in prosperous, professional northeast Jackson told itself. The rationale was that this school would be different from an academy. A couple of founders were world renowned physicians on the University of Mississippi medical school faculty. This certainly impressed my father and mother. And me as well.
Many prominent businesspeople and professionals had organized the school. As I recall, each student family purchased “stock” which provided capital for the school. On top of that, tuition was paid for each student. As if to emphasize the distinction, the name of Prep did not include “academy.” It was as if the organizers were trying to create distance between Prep and the reality of the time.
“People” said that Jackson needed a “real” option that was a “college preparatory school.” And Jackson Prep was meant to deliver that. I believed it. At least, I wanted to believe it. 
But somehow it rang hollow. There was a gathering of student leaders from around Jackson at the Mississippi Fairgrounds my senior year. Public and private schools sent groups. Another Prep student made a speech that attempted to demonstrate that students, regardless of the school attended, had more similarities than differences. I was moved by his persuasiveness. But his argument was empty rhetoric.
The exodus to private schools I was part of had been prompted by fear of the “other.” The eloquent oratory of a classmate could not stave off the trauma we all were living with. That we all continue to live with.
Many of the “best” faculty from Murrah moved to Prep. The English and drama teacher I had in 11th and 12th grade was one of them. The football coach and most of the white players came to Prep. There was a sense that Prep was a continuation of pre-integration Murrah. I don’t recall talking about the why’s or how’s of that happening. It just was. 
I was glad to be back “home.” There were many students who would have been my classmates at Murrah had we not opted out. Did we talk about this obvious fact? I don’t remember if we did. But I do remember driving by Murrah often as it was on the way to my grandmother’s apartment in Belhaven. The question of what had happened hung in the air. Unspoken. But very real.
When I look back, I see how careful and intentional a lot of our silences were. We Prep transplants wanted to believe we were a cut above academy “rednecks.” In our DNA, though, Prep was as white and as new as the other estimated four thousand white-flight private schools that popped up in the South at the time of integration.
I joined the debate team and participated in dramatic productions; signed up for the Key Club; found a group who played the board game Risk; went to most football games; had my first rum and coke. I wanted to think of myself as an “academic.” Actually, I was a pseudo-intellectual. Or maybe, I was just an awkward teenage boy in a shifting white world. 
All of our parents were middle and upper class. I don’t know what the “stock” buy-in was, nor the amount of tuition, but the costs were considerable. I knew the cost kept some from attending. I heard somewhere that maybe, one day, there would be a Black student at Prep. Maybe. One day. When a Black student had the potential to be a star athlete or win a national debate tournament was found. Then.
There was something Prep offered that Murrah could not. Murrah drew from a set city attendance zone. As a private school, Prep took in white students from beyond northeast Jackson and even outlying towns. The sectional divisions of north, south and west Jackson were quite real. Even among the white population, there was economic and class messaging for each section. In more recent years, a couple of my non-north Jackson classmates told me how awkward they felt due to the weight of class and Jackson social strata. But all of us were white.  
My journey took me to college in Alabama before returning to Ole Miss for grad school. I don’t know when, or even if, I decided I’d become a Mississippi ex-pat. It just happened. There was an invitation to enroll in an Auburn Ph.D. program, a job in North Carolina and then seminary in Kentucky.
I honed an interest in church history, especially how what is said correlates with what is actually done. Unsurprisingly, I suppose, that’s what I’m examining in my own school history here. That focus also led to my book, Religion & Race: Southern Presbyterians 1946-1983 and some published articles on religion, race and faith. 
Along the way my father retired. My parents moved to North Carolina. I found my way back to North Carolina and then to Georgia, where I’ve resided longer than I lived in Mississippi. Yet it is Mississippi, not Georgia, that has always been on my mind.
I wondered if there was a “call” for me to serve as a pastor in Mississippi. There were some conversations and interviews when our sons were school age. No offers were made. Even so the topic my wife and I often turned to in those times was how to provide our children with a “good education.” 
As it happens, I did return to Jackson for a season. I served as the interim pastor of Fondren Presbyterian Church for 18 months. So much had changed. There I found white folk who had stood firm for public schools back in that day. They seem to have found the “good education” my parents sought.
As my mother would say: “Look how far we have come.” 
I would respond: “And look how far we have to go.”

(Julia Goldberg / Source NM)Six months,100 cases and 56,000 vaccines later, New Mexico’s measles outbreak has come to an end.
So said New Mexico health officials on Friday, noting in a news release that the state logged its last case on Aug. 14 in Santa Fe County, meaning more than 42 days have passed without new cases, “a timeframe that represents twice the virus’s maximum incubation period.”
3 new measles cases pushes New Mexico’s total count of infections to 100

NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM the end of the outbreak means the risk of measles spread inside New Mexico is lower. However, “We do still have outbreaks ongoing in states surrounding us, so we will remain vigilant for folks in our state traveling to those areas or folks from those areas traveling to us and will work to detect any imported cases,” he said.
Smelser said vaccine recommendations remain the same: Two doses of the measles vaccine will be the most protective for most people.
New Mexico reported its first measles case on Feb. 11, a Lea County teenager, whose case followed an outbreak in the neighboring Gaines County in Texas. The state subsequently declared an outbreak three days later when two adults in the same county tested positive, meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention threshold for constituting an outbreak.
In total, New Mexico’s 100 cases spread across nine counties, with one reported death. Of the cases, 53 were among people 18 years and older; 24 were among people 4-years-old and younger and 23 were among people ages 5 to 17. More than half the cases —57 — were among unvaccinated people. It was the largest outbreak of measles in New Mexico in the past four decades.
Since Feb. 1, more than 56,000 people have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, NMDOH says, which remains “widely available” in the state.
The number of people seeking a vaccine during the outbreak was 61% higher than the number of people who received shots over the same time last year, which Smelser credited for keeping the rate of spread low.
“Folks who came in and got themselves up to date really helped us stop this from getting even worse,” Smelser said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee National Guard troops will be deputized as part of an “accelerated” crime-fighting effort set to start next week in Memphis but will not make arrests or carry weapons unless requested by police, Gov. Bill Lee said Friday.
“Information from the police department … on what support they need will determine and drive whether or not a particular National Guardsman is armed,” he said. 
The governor announced the state will direct $100 million toward a state, federal and local partnership to crack down on crime. Some 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers will be assigned to the city along with an undetermined number of Guard personnel and more than a dozen federal agencies, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The anti-crime task force will operate “as long as it takes” to make Memphians feel safe to go to a Grizzlies basketball game at the FedEx Forum or Beale Street without fear of being a victim of crime, the governor said.
Even though Lee told reporters a month ago that National Guard deployment wasn’t being considered, he said planning for the operation with Mayor Paul Young and the Trump administration has been taking place for months. 










I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city. 


– Memphis Mayor Paul Young 


National Guard troops are to be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, which will oversee the operation, and will play a support role as a “force multiplier,” Lee said. He did not detail the tasks they would take up.
“Never before has a city in the country had access to these resources,” Lee said.
The crime-fighting effort is necessary, he said, to boost economic recruitment and to give relief to residents such as a mother who described to him the loss of her son to street violence.
The governor didn’t declare a state of emergency activating the National Guard but authorized the deployment at the request of the federal government. President Donald Trump recently signed a memorandum directing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to approve the plan and use of Guard troops.
Asked about the potential for friction between troops and neighborhood residents, Lee said people will understand the support role troops will play when they see them “on the ground.” 
Young said he wants to sustain gains made in cutting crime such as a 13% reduction in overall crime in 2024, a 19% cut in violent crime and 29% reduction in murders, followed by similar figures in 2025.

“I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city,” Young said.
Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis said the department has been asking for more federal help for several years and added that she wants to make sure “Memphians know the work being done is on their behalf.”
State lawmakers who represent inner-city Memphis have criticized the plan to deploy National Guard troops there.
Talks with FBI Director Kash Patel started this spring, and initially the FBI was to lead the effort in Memphis.
“It was never off the table that the National Guard would be used. But it wasn’t the plan at the time … that this would develop,” Lee said.
As talks unfolded with the Trump administration, the option for federal funding to bring in the National Guard and federal agencies to back local law enforcement made it “evident” that the plan should be put into place, Lee said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida law now requires educators to self-report to their employers within 48 hours an arrest for a felony or certain misdemeanors.
The list of offenses ranges from sexual misconduct with mental health patients, felony fraud, murder, aggravated assault, human trafficking, weapons on school grounds, prostitution, felony voyeurism, threats to kill, and more.
Educators also now have to self-report to their schools convictions, commitments to pretrial diversion programs, or findings of guilt for “any criminal offense other than a minor traffic violation within 48 hours after the final judgement.”
The change is a result of SB 1374, passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year. This week, the Florida Board of Education approved inserting language from that law in the Principles of Professional Conduct for the Education Profession in Florida. 
Previously, teachers were required to self-report within 48 hours arrests or charges related only to the abuse of a child or sale or possession of controlled substances. 
The law requires school boards to develop a policy for temporarily removing teachers from classrooms within 24 hours of notification of a felony or certain misdemeanor offenses. 
Violation of the principles of professional conduct for teachers is ground for suspension or revocation of a teaching license.
The measure passed the Senate and the House unanimously, although some lawmakers raised concerns about how the measure could compromise due process. 
Sen. Clay Yarborough, R-Jacksonville, sponsored the Senate version and Rep. Will Robinson, R-Bradenton, sponsored the House version.
The law acknowledges that teachers notifying of an arrest is not an admission of guilt.

A growing number of Americans believe that gender-affirming care will become less accessible in their lifetime, a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll finds — reflecting a political landscape that has become increasingly hostile toward transgender health care.
Nearly 4 in 10 Americans think gender-affirming care will become less accessible over the course of their lifetime. A year ago, The 19th and SurveyMonkey found only 20 percent of Americans felt that way. But since President Donald Trump returned to office, the federal government has subpoenaed doctors for trans patients’ private data and pressured hospitals in blue states to close their clinics that provided gender-affirming care to minors. The administration has pledged to investigate the care as medical fraud, despite the medical community’s broad endorsement of gender-affirming care as an effective treatment for gender dysphoria, which is persistent distress felt when one’s body is out of sync with their identity.
Thirty-one percent of Americans believe gender-affirming care will become more accessible in their lifetime, down from 48 percent in 2024. Women are generally more likely than men to think access will expand —  except for Gen Z.
The SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, provides a detailed window into what Americans believe about trans health care, after conservative groups have poured millions of dollars into anti-trans campaign ads. The survey had a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.

A majority of Americans (53 percent) believe transgender adults should have access to gender-affirming care, while 37 percent believe that trans minors should have that same access. But they’re divided on whether politicians should intervene: Half of Americans oppose lawmakers banning or restricting care for transgender youth.
Many Americans across the political spectrum would prefer that politicians avoid focusing on trans issues at all. Four in ten Americans — with an even split between Democrats and Republicans — think politicians should not focus on transgender issues. This alignment marks a notable difference from 2024, when 33 percent of Democrats agreed with this hands-off stance compared with 53 percent of Republicans.
The past year has seen significant hand-wringing within the Democratic Party on trans rights. Some have argued that Democrats let Republicans dominate the public’s perception of trans people during the 2024 election — and lost voters in the process.
The share of Republicans who believe politicians should focus on restricting gender-affirming care has risen since last year (49 percent versus 35 percent), while the share of Democrats who believe politicians should focus on protecting transgender people has dipped (52 percent versus 58 percent).
Among parents, only 31 percent of those with kids under 18 support gender-affirming care access for trans youth — compared with 47 percent of non-parents. Overall, mothers are more likely than fathers to be in favor of such care. LGBTQ+ parents are also more likely to be supportive of trans youth accessing the health care.
Trans minors and trans adults go through very different processes to receive gender-affirming care. Young kids socially transition, meaning they change their outward appearance to match their gender expression by getting a haircut or wearing masculine or feminine clothes. If they feel affirmed through that social transition, further options for care include puberty blockers or, for adolescents, hormone replacement therapy. Both of these options alleviate gender dysphoria and require ongoing doctor’s appointments to monitor treatment, as well as parental consent. The majority of trans youth do not undergo surgery.
The survey also indicates that one dynamic may be shifting, at least among Republicans. Past polling, including from The 19th and SurveyMonkey, showed that people who know trans people are less likely to oppose access to gender-affirming care. While this year’s data shows that is true for Democrats, among Republicans, knowing a trans person made no difference when it came to care for minors and a small one when it came to care for adults. Still, 48 percent of Republicans who know a trans person strongly oppose access to gender-affirming care for adults, versus 56 percent who do not know a trans person.
LGBTQ+ advocates have long relied on sharing the personal stories of transgender people as a tool to push for protective policies and to oppose discriminatory ones. But as conservative media outlets and politicians have amplified more misinformation about trans people and their health care, that strategy may not be as effective as it has been in the past.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19th-Poll-2025-Gender-Care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 13:57:22.176588

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas PBS Commission approved a $206,000 salary Friday for Rep. Carlton Wing as the agency’s new CEO and executive director starting Sept. 29. 
The commission nominated the North Little Rock Republican and House Speaker Pro Tempore to replace Courtney Pledger, who resigned in April after leading the public television network for eight years. If confirmed, Wing would be required to resign from the Arkansas Legislature, triggering a special election to finish his term through 2027. Wing announced in June that he would not run for reelection to a sixth term next year.
Commission Vice Chairman Woody Freeman told commissioners at Friday’s special-call meeting that the state allows a salary range of $155,000 to $211,000 for the executive director position. Arkansas PBS budgeted $211,000 for the role, and Freeman said he recommended $206,000 because of Wing’s “business background, his extensive media background and he’s a highly respected legislator.”
Wing is serving his fifth term in the House and is a former sports broadcaster for Little Rock’s KARK. He also co-founded the video production company Wing Media Group with his wife. 
Asked by commissioners about the proposed salary, Freeman said it was the lowest compared to neighboring states. Sanji Kumpuris, who has served as interim director, said Pledger’s salary was more than $190,000, though she couldn’t recall the exact amount. Kumpuris also noted Wing would not be eligible for a merit increase next June because he was hired after the July 1 deadline to be eligible for this cycle. 
Arkansas lawmakers approved merit pay raises for nearly 500 state employees in June 2024, including Pledger whose annual salary was expected to increase from $179,999.87 to $190,961.86, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. 
The Arkansas PBS Commission approved Wing’s proposed salary and a motion by Gary Newton to have Wing work with the governor to ensure the interim title was bestowed to Kumpuris and that she be retroactively paid at the agreed upon rate for the time she served in the position. Newton asked that Wing report back to the commission on these tasks at its next meeting.

(Screenshot/Office of the Special Counsel YouTube channel)Former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman’s license to practice law in Wisconsin has been suspended for three years after a third-party referee agreed with the state Office of Lawyer Regulation’s allegations that he violated standards for professional conduct during his much-maligned review of the 2020 presidential election. 
The suspension marks the conclusion of Gableman’s effort to fight attempts to hold him accountable for his conduct during the election investigation. The OLR found that while working on behalf of Assembly Speaker Robin Vos to look into alleged wrongdoing during the election, Gableman lied to a Waukesha County judge about conversations he had with other attorneys, lied to an Assembly committee, deliberately violated state open records laws, used his agreement with Vos to pursue his own political interests, violated his duty of confidentiality to his client and lied in an affidavit to the OLR as it was investigating him. 
Gableman’s investigation ultimately cost the state more than $2.3 million without finding any evidence to confirm President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of fraud during the 2020 election. 
The review also helped further fan the flames of election conspiracy theories in the state. Those beliefs have remained prominent among segments of the state Republican Party’s base nearly five years after the election. 
After fighting the allegations against him, Gableman ultimately reached an agreement with the OLR and stipulated that the allegations in the complaint against him were true. 
In his report the referee, James Winiarski, wrote that the consequences for Gableman’s actions must be severe. 
“A high level of discipline is needed to protect the public, the courts and the legal system from repetition of Attorney Gableman’s misconduct by Attorney Gableman or any other attorneys,” Winiarski wrote. “His misconduct was very public in nature and involved many members of the public and employees of several municipalities.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The former director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and a co-owner of two Lincoln strip clubs both pleaded not guilty this week in a public corruption case alleging the director took money, lap dances and sexual favors at the clubs while working for the state board overseeing liquor licenses.
Former Liquor Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe faces seven felony charges, three counts of honest services fraud, a charge that a public official or employee deprived the people of their honest work or services, one count of conspiring to commit honest services fraud, two counts of wire fraud and a single count of extortion.
One of his alleged co-conspirators, Brent Zywiec, a part owner of Lincoln strip club The Office and a former co-owner of The Night Before Lounge, faces four felony charges, three counts of honest services fraud and one count of conspiring to commit such fraud. Each of the charges against both men could lead to prison sentences of up to 20 years. 
Both men joined their first federal court hearings in Lincoln by video conference from jails in Saunders and Saline Counties, and both successfully fought federal prosecutors’ efforts to detain them through trial. 
Ex-Nebraska Liquor Commission director charged with taking cash, sexual favors in strip club probe

U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline DeLuca released both after ruling in hearings on Thursday that the federal government had failed to make a compelling argument to hold them. 
Prosecutors had argued that Rupe was at risk of harming himself or obstructing the investigation, basing it on comments he had made after search warrants were served and after investigators alleged that he had shared information about police investigations of a competing Omaha strip club with the club co-owner. 
In a longer hearing, they argued Zywiec was a risk to influence or intimidate witnesses because of his alleged ties to the motorcycle gang Hell’s Angels, basing it on witness interviews with people who said they worried about speaking out against him.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Mruz based most of her arguments for continued detention on testimony from FBI Special Agent Alex Cross, who said either man might discuss the case with others and put witness statements or other information crucial to proving the case at risk. He pointed to efforts between them to share that they were being investigated and to shift communications from cellphones that could be wiretapped to a more secure encrypted app.
But the attorney for Rupe, Bill McGinn, and the attorney for Zywiec, Carlos Monzón, argued that their clients had already shown they were not risks. Monzón also argued that the government had offered no evidence that his client had attempted to contact, persuade or threaten anyone related to the case. 
The judge seemed to agree, letting both men go free Thursday night.
McGinn did not immediately return messages seeking comment about the case. Monzón, reached Friday, said his client is “totally innocent” and called the case an example of “government overreach.”
“I find it almost offensive that here is an individual that is helping law enforcement, and they’re claiming that he is trying to harm a competitor that is 50 or 60 miles away from his business,” Monzón said. “It makes no sense.”
U.S. Attorney Lesley Woods, in a statement Thursday and in a press conference earlier this week, argued that “public corruption undermines” public trust in public officials.
The federal indictment unsealed this week alleges that Rupe, who had served nearly a decade as an assistant Nebraska attorney general, accepted payments and services from the clubs from 2022-2025.
Among the gifts offered and accepted, it said, were free entry into bars that usually charge $20 cover fees, free drinks and cash to cover free lap dances, VIP dances and additional services that included oral sex.
Federal authorities say at least one surveillance video that investigators secured showed Rupe receiving sexual favors. Some videos of people in compromising positions were saved to the owner’s iCloud account, the indictment says. Rupe is also accused of looking the other way when he should have seen or known that potential liquor license violations were occurring.
“The citizens of Nebraska are the primary victims of this case,” Woods said. “The Executive Director of the Liquor Control Commission should be the official who polices establishments like the ones identified in the indictment for the benefit of public safety.”

All three names have been floated as possible replacements for Frank White Jr. if he is recalled next week. (Provided photos via KC Beacon)As voters cast ballots in the special Tuesday election to recall Jackson County Executive Frank White Jr., a question that’s rarely been openly discussed lingers.
If White is removed from office, who will be selected to replace him?
The Jackson County Legislature would be tasked with nominating and voting to confirm his replacement to serve out the rest of his term. That person would steer the county government for the next 14 months. If they choose to run for reelection in 2026, they would have a leg up as the incumbent to hold on to that position as long as they keep running.
It’s an important question. And it’s one that several elected members of the county Legislature are hoping that voters will ignore — at least for now.
Legislator Sean Smith, a Republican who represents southeastern Jackson County, wants voters to remain focused on White’s performance as the county executive.
“The vote is only about one thing. Is Frank doing a good enough job that he should stay in office?” Smith said.
Smith said it would also be disrespectful to White to name his replacement before he’s even been removed from office. He compared it to introducing someone to their replacement before they’ve even been fired.
“We’re not supposed to select somebody and then have them have a competition (against White),” Smith said. “We as legislators shouldn’t be manipulating the vote.”
White disagrees. He has called for the legislators to be more transparent about their intentions.
“I must speak plainly: what troubles me most is the Legislature’s refusal to answer the most basic question — if a vacancy were to occur, how will the next County Executive be chosen?” White said in a written statement. “That silence speaks volumes. It suggests there is no interest in a fair and open selection — only in backroom deals and political favors.”
Publicly, the legislators are tight-lipped about whom they might pick.
But behind the scenes, the campaign for the next county executive is already underway.
 The secret race to become county executive

Two candidates have publicly expressed their desire to replace White if he is recalled: Phil LeVota and Dan Tarwater.
LeVota is an attorney who worked in the county prosecutor’s office for a decade.
Tarwater served on the Jackson County Legislature for 28 years before running for Kansas City Council in 2023. He lost to KC Tenants organizer Johnathan Duncan.
County Legislator Manny Abarca IV also has been rumored to be in the running to replace White, but he told The Beacon that he is not seeking the position.
“I have no interest in seeking that role,” he said. “I’m usually looked at as the aggressive one of the bunch, and no one wants to put me in that seat, so I’ll gracefully step back from the opportunity there.”
DaRon McGee, who represents the 4th District and chairs the Legislature, wants voters to trust legislators to make the right decision if the recall is successful and they vote for White’s potential successor. The votes of at least five of nine legislators are needed to approve a replacement for White.
“We elect members of Congress to cast votes on our behalf,” he told The Beacon. “You trust these representatives to represent your best interests. And that’s all I can say. We have to trust the process.”
The Beacon asked McGee if he was willing to share any other candidates he was aware of aside from LeVota and Tarwater, and he responded, “No, not at this time.”
McGee didn’t say he also is a candidate to succeed White.
Abarca confirmed that McGee has joined Tarwater and LeVota as a third candidate to replace White. (This had already been shared with The Beacon by four other people involved in county politics who did not want the information attributed to them.)
Even some of McGee’s colleagues have been kept in the dark as to who is in the running to replace White.
If McGee is a candidate to be county executive, County Legislator Megan Smith said, that has never been communicated with her.
“No names have been presented to the legislature (that I am aware of) as nominees to consider seriously,” she told The Beacon in a text message.
She represents the 3rd At-Large District, which covers the southern third of the county.
 ‘No clearer violation of the ethics standards’

McGee didn’t address the possibility that he could vote for himself as county executive. In theory, though, he said he didn’t believe it would be a conflict of interest for a legislator to vote for themselves.
“We vote for appointments for ourselves all the time,” he said. “So for example, I’m on the Mid-American Regional Council board, I’m on the zoo board, I’m on the Starlight board, representing the Legislature, and I vote for those resolutions for myself.”
The difference is that those board appointments he listed are unpaid. The county executive, in contrast, made nearly $130,000 in 2023 — more than three times the salary of a county legislator.
At least one of McGee’s colleagues in the Legislature said that voting for yourself to succeed White would not only be inappropriate, but also a likely violation of the county’s code of ethics.
“As legislators, we make 36 grand a year, and as county executive, they make 140 or something,” Sean Smith said. “There could be no clearer violation of the ethics standards than to vote for yourself.”
Notably, White faced a similar situation in 2016 when he was nominated to replace former County Executive Mike Sanders.

White was a legislator at the time, representing the 1st At-Large District, and he abstained from the vote to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. He was confirmed by an 8-0 vote by his colleagues on the Legislature.
Chris Crawford, the director of Jackson County’s Ethics, Human Relations & Citizen Complaints Department, would not speculate on a hypothetical scenario in which McGee would cast a vote for himself.
“I definitely can see the justification of why it could be considered a violation,” he said. “But the ethics code does have some ambiguous language in it and interpretation in it as well.”
Abarca said he can also understand the opinion that voting for oneself could be considered a conflict of interest. But he said he has asked the county counselor to provide specific guidance as to whether it would be illegal.
The Beacon spoke with Tarwater and LeVota, who didn’t believe that it was a conflict of interest.
 An alternative method to select White’s replacement

The three main candidates for county executive are working with legislators to recruit the five votes needed to win confirmation.
That’s how the nominating process worked in 2016 when White was voted in to replace Sanders. But it’s not the only option.
In 2011, Jim Kanatzar was named a circuit judge and resigned from his position as Jackson County prosecutor. Sanders, who was county executive at the time, was tasked with naming his replacement.
He could have selected someone on his own. Instead, he created a five-member independent nominating committee, containing no members of the Legislature.
The committee kicked off with a community listening session with members of the public. Tony Miller, an attorney from Lee’s Summit, was one of the five committee members. Miller would later become a county legislator four years later.

At that listening session, he said, they had a blackboard and asked the audience to help brainstorm characteristics they were looking for in a future prosecutor.
The Mid-America Regional Council provided support to the county and helped oversee the entire process.
“Although not legally required, it seems to be the most democratic thing you could do,” Miller said. “To get community input through a nonpartisan outlet such as MARC, to convene something like this and include even members of the academic community … to give a different perspective than just self-interested politicians.”
The committee solicited a large pool of applications, then held public interviews with the top eight candidates.
They narrowed it down to three candidates, who met privately with Sanders for the final interview. Then he appointed Jean Peters Baker, who would be reelected in 2012, 2016 and 2020.
The county used a similar process in 2018, when then-Sheriff Mike Sharp resigned from office, to select Darryl Forte as the interim appointee.
 Could Jackson County do the same thing if White is recalled?

McGee, chair of the Jackson County Legislature, is not interested in following that process. He believes that the county should do what it did in 2016, when White was appointed without a formal application process.
He said that the people who are interested in running are circulating their resumes and talking with legislators, and he doesn’t think it would make a difference to solicit applications.
McGee also doesn’t want to deliberate on the merits of each nominee at a public meeting.
“What I’m going to do is provide a forum or a process that will allow members to nominate someone, and then we will cast a vote,” he said.
Tarwater and LeVota both said that they would be open to having a public interview during the selection process.
Under his preferred process, McGee said, the public won’t get a vote on the county executive, so the candidates only need to make their case to the legislators — not to the general public.
“The reality is, this election (to replace White), if he is recalled, is not an election of the public,” he said. “This is a vote of the Legislature. So the audience is much smaller, and so you’re speaking to nine individuals.”
At least two of the three potential candidates have political baggage that could come up in a public forum that may not come up otherwise.
In 2022, Tarwater made enemies with KC Tenants, the citywide tenant union, when they said he behaved disrespectfully towards tenants at a mobile home village who were displaced by the Jackson County Detention Center.
That grudge led the union’s political arm, KC Tenants Power, to ask Johnathan Duncan to run against him in the Kansas City Council’s 6th District race to prevent him from winning the seat.
Meanwhile, McGee resigned from the Missouri House of Representatives in 2018 amid allegations of sexual harassment.
McGee was accused of pursuing an unwanted relationship with an employee for 10 months. He was then accused of obstructing an ethics committee investigation related to the allegation. The ethics committee ultimately recommended stripping him of his committee assignments, and he resigned before it could come to a vote on the floor.
Sean Smith and Abarca disagree with McGee about how the nominating process should go. Abarca said he wasn’t sure the 2011 process should necessarily be the model, but he believes transparency is critical to restore trust in the county.
Smith told The Beacon that he had been unaware of the 2011 process, but having learned about it, he thought it was an interesting idea to consider.
“For one thing, you’d let people get familiar with someone,” he said. “After people have watched the video, they would have the opportunity to give us feedback. So as a legislator, I’d love that, because they might observe something that I didn’t notice.”

For months, the complaints have rolled in from parts of the country hit by natural disasters: The Federal Emergency Management Agency was moving far too slowly in sending aid to communities ravaged by floods and hurricanes, including in central Texas and North Carolina. Many officials were blaming Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, whose agency oversees FEMA.
“I can’t get phone calls back,” Ted Budd, the Republican senator from North Carolina, told a newspaper this month, describing his attempts to reach Noem’s office. “I can’t get them to initiate the money. It’s just a quagmire.” The delays were caused in part by a new policy announced by DHS that requires Noem’s personal sign-off on expenses over $100,000, several news outlets reported.
But records obtained by ProPublica show how one locality found a way to get FEMA aid more quickly: It asked one of Noem’s political donors for help.
The records show that Noem quickly expedited more than $11 million of federal money to rebuild a historic pier in Naples, Florida, after she was contacted by a major financial supporter last month. The pier is a tourist attraction in the wealthy Gulf Coast enclave and was badly damaged by Hurricane Ian in 2022.
Frustrated city officials had been laboring for months, without success, to get disaster assistance. But just two weeks after the donor stepped in, they were celebrating their sudden change of fortune. “We are now at warp speed with FEMA,” one city official wrote in an email. A FEMA representative wrote: “Per leadership instruction, pushing project immediately.”
Along with fast-tracking the money, Noem flew to Naples on a government plane to tour the pier herself. She then stayed for the weekend and got dinner with the donor, local cardiologist Sinan Gursoy, at the French restaurant Bleu Provence, according to records and an interview with the Naples mayor. This account is based on text messages and emails ProPublica obtained through public records requests.
Noem’s actions in Naples suggest the injection of political favoritism into an agency tasked with saving lives and rebuilding communities wiped out by disaster. It also heightens concerns about the discretion Noem has given herself by personally handling all six-figure expenses at the agency, consolidating her power over who wins and loses in the pursuit of federal relief dollars, experts said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said that politics has long been a factor in federal disaster relief — one study found that swing states are more likely to get federal help, for example. But “I’ve not heard of anything this egregious — a donor calling up and saying I need help and getting it,” he said, “while others may be getting denied assistance or otherwise waiting in line for help that may or may not come.”
In a statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, “This has nothing to do with politics: Secretary Noem also visited Ruidoso, NM” — where floods killed three people in July — “at the request of a Democrat governor and has been integral in supporting and speeding up their recovery efforts.”
“Your criticizing the Secretary’s visit to the Pier is bizarre as she works to fix this issue for more than 1 million visitors that used to visit the pier,” McLaughlin added. She did not answer questions about the donor’s role in expediting the funding or Noem’s relationship with him. Reached by phone, Gursoy said “get lost” and hung up. He did not respond to detailed follow up questions.

Noem has been criticized for creating a bottleneck at FEMA. When the floods hit Texas this summer — ultimately killing over 100 people — it took days to deploy critical search-and-rescue teams because Noem hadn’t signed off on them, according to CNN. Budd, the Republican senator, said this month: “Pretty much everything Helene-related is over $100,000. So they’re stacking up on her desk waiting for her signature.”
Noem has denied there were delays in the Texas flood response and has defended her expense policy, saying it has saved billions of dollars. “Every day I get up and I think, the American people are paying for this, should they?” she recently said. “And are these dollars doing what the law says they should be doing? I’m going to make sure that they go there.”
Once a sleepy fishing town, Naples is now home to CEOs and billionaires (a property listed for $295 million recently made headlines as the most expensive home in the U.S.). The city is known as an important stop for Republican politicians raising money, and Noem has held multiple fundraisers in the area. State credit card records suggest she visited Naples at least 10 times during her last four years as South Dakota governor.
Noem’s top adviser, Corey Lewandowski, also appears to own a home in Naples near the city’s pier, according to property tax records. Lewandowski is an unpaid staffer at DHS serving as Noem’s de facto chief of staff. (Media reports have alleged the two are romantically involved, which they have both denied.) Lewandowski told ProPublica that he was not involved in the pier decision and that he was not in Naples during Noem’s visit.


Let us know what you think...


 

For the first seven months of the Trump administration, the pier reconstruction was in bureaucratic purgatory. The city had long been struggling to secure the regulatory approvals it needed to start building, and emails suggest Trump’s wave of federal layoffs had made the process even slower. “These agencies are undergoing significant reorganizations and staff reductions,” a city official told a frustrated constituent in early August. That “sometimes means starting over with new reviewers — something we’ve faced more than once.”
McLaughlin said “both past FEMA and the City bear responsibility” for the delays. She listed “several failures” since the process started in 2023, including “FEMA staff changing up” and indecision by the city government.
By this summer, Naples officials were getting desperate. In June, one tried to enlist Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to press FEMA to move ahead. “We were told yesterday that Secretary Noem would have to ‘personally’ approve the Pier project before FEMA funding would be obligated,” the city official wrote to the senator’s staff. The Naples mayor, Teresa Heitmann, also personally wrote to FEMA. Heitmann said she was “perplexed” by the delays and begged the agency for guidance.
Heitmann had long been paying expensive Washington consultants to help her city navigate the process. But she was “feeling increasingly helpless,” she later said, until she had the idea that would finally put her project on the fast track. On July 18, the mayor emailed a Google search to herself: “Who is the head of Homeland security?” She was going to go straight to Noem.
Heitmann determined that her best bet for getting Noem’s attention was Gursoy. A Naples cardiologist, Gursoy has no obvious experience working with the federal government; much of his online footprint centers on his enthusiasm for pinball. But Gursoy gave Noem at least $25,000 to support her campaign for governor in 2022. That was enough to put him near the top of Noem’s disclosed donor list. (In South Dakota, campaign contributions remain relatively small.)
On planning documents for the 2024 Republican National Convention obtained by ProPublica, the Florida doctor is listed as an attendee affiliated with the delegation from South Dakota, a state he has no apparent connection to besides his support for Noem. Heitmann told ProPublica that Gursoy introduced her to Noem at a political event at a private home in Naples while Noem was governor.
“Hello it’s Teresa,” the mayor texted Gursoy in early August. “I really need your help.” She explained the tangle of bureaucracy she’d been contending with. “FEMA is holding us up,” Heitmann wrote. “Kristi Noem could put some fire under the FEMA employees slacking.”
Gursoy responded: “Okay. I will get on it.”
The next week, on Aug. 11, the doctor gave Heitmann an update. “Kristi was off for a few days for the first time in a long time, so I left her alone,” he said. “I just txted her now.” Within 24 hours, he had exciting news. He told the mayor to expect a call from Noem’s “FEMA fixer” shortly.

The identity of the “fixer” is not clear, but by Aug. 27, Naples officials were seeing a “flurry of activity” from Noem’s agency. That day, a FEMA staffer told the city that “FEMA is intending to expedite the funding” for the pier. “Secretary Noem took immediate action when I reached out to ask for help,” the mayor soon posted on Facebook.
Two days later, Noem flew to Naples. Her schedule listed a 30-minute walk-through at the pier with the mayor, followed by a nail salon appointment and dinner at Bleu Provence, which serves wagyu short ribs and seared foie gras. Noem then stayed through the weekend at the four-star Naples Bay Resort & Marina. Heitmann told ProPublica she wasn’t at the French dinner but Gursoy was. “I didn’t ask her to come, but she showed up,” the mayor told the local news. “I was very impressed.”
Before she left town, Noem posted about the Naples pier on Instagram. She was finally getting the project back on track, she said. “Americans deserve better than years of red tape and failed disaster responses,” Noem wrote. “Under @POTUS Trump, this incompetency ends.”
DHS did not answer questions about whether the government paid for Noem’s weekend in Naples.

In a Sept. 20 social media post, Trump had publicly pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against Comey — with whom he has long feuded — and other political opponents. In the same post, Trump referenced the prosecutions against him to justify an investigation into his opponents. He also withdrew the nomination of a federal prosecutor in Virginia who reportedly resisted instructions to prosecute Comey and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer who had worked for Trump in his personal capacity. Trump celebrated the indictment in a Thursday evening post.“JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” Trump wrote. “One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI.”Asked by a reporter Friday morning if others would face retribution, Trump said he hoped so.“They weaponized the Justice Department like nobody in history,” he said. “What they've done is terrible. And so I would, frankly, I hope there are others, because you can't let this happen to a country.”Trump motives questionedTrump’s moves led Democrats and other Trump critics to describe Comey’s prosecution as an act of retribution meant to punish the president’s opponents, violating a longstanding norm separating the president from direct involvement in Justice Department activity.In an early Friday post to X, Patel sought to counter that narrative, saying professionals handled the investigation.“Career FBI agents, intel analysts, and staff led the investigation into Comey and others,” he wrote. “They called the balls and strikes and will continue to do so. The wildly false accusations attacking this FBI for the politicization of law enforcement comes from the same bankrupt media that sold the world on Russia Gate- it’s hypocrisy on steroids. Their baseless objections tell us now, more than ever, that we are precisely over the target and will remain on mission until completion.”Comey’s initial court date is scheduled for Oct. 9 in Alexandria, Virginia, in front of U.S. District Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. His summons were served to Patrick Fitzgerald, a longtime federal prosecutor who is leading Comey’s defense.The grand jury charged Comey with lying to Congress and obstructing a proceeding of Congress related to his testimony to a Senate committee about whether he authorized FBI agents to leak information about a probe into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.Democrats blast indictmentIn a lengthy statement Thursday, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, called the indictment “blatantly fraudulent and vindictive.”“The rule of law was supposed to replace vendettas, blood feuds, and mad kings exacting vengeance on their perceived enemies,” Raskin wrote. “This sordid episode is one more savage assault on justice in America.”Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois called on Republicans to oppose Trump’s involvement with the Justice Department.“The Department of Justice has become a political tool of a vengeful President,” Durbin said in a Friday morning statement. “President Trump wears his corruption like a badge of honor and defies anyone daring to challenge him. The Attorney General willingly complies with every order from the White House.

“I still possess the heart and desire to serve the people of Connecticut,” Tooker said in a statement, adding that as she closes her campaign, “I will be actively exploring other avenues in which my name can remain on the ballot in November of 2026.”
Tooker’s announcement comes two weeks before the deadline for reporting third-quarter fundraising. In July, she reported raising $81,252 since declaring her candidacy in March. Tooker also contributed $20,000 of her own funds.
“I entered this race to be the next Governor of Connecticut as a true outsider who feels the call to serve the state I love, knowing that this amazing state is in desperate need of a course correction,” she wrote. “However, after very serious thought and deliberation, it has become clear to me that the voters need more time to get to know me, and I need more time to get to know them.”
Her departure leaves Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich as the only Republican waging an active campaign for governor. New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, who has been raising money since January through an exploratory committee, is expected to declare after the municipal elections in November.
Three other Republicans have declared campaigns for other statewide offices: Matt Corey for lieutenant governor, former Rep. Fred Wilms for treasurer and Peter Lumaj for secretary of the state.
No Republican has won statewide office in Connecticut since Gov. M. Jodi Rell in 2006.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the other five Democratic constitutional officers are expected to run in 2026. Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas is the only among them to have created a campaign committee.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has over a dozen offices and facilities in Louisiana, researching in fields such as coastal restoration, weather forecasting and fisheries science. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A new interactive map highlights the impact of a government agency that’s provided critical climate information as the Trump administration has targeted it for budget cuts and reduced research.   
The nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund has released an online tool that tracks 735 subagencies under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and where the services they provide are used. Its analysis includes the National Weather Service, the National Hurricane Center and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.
After taking office, President Donald Trump authorized billionaire Elon Musk to evaluate spending and efficiency throughout the federal government. Musk’s unofficial Department of Government Efficiency was ordered to cut 10% of its workforce, which includes more than 10,000 employees.
“This transparency is more important than ever,” Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a press release. “DOGE’s attacks on NOAA programs are already undermining our safety from extreme weather, and any additional cuts to weather reporting and storm tracking would threaten our communities even further.”
NOAA provides daily weather forecasts and emergency alerts for extreme weather across the county, including hurricane forecasting and storm tracking. The agency also leads climate research, coastal restoration and fisheries monitoring work both within the agency and through local partnerships. 
Louisiana has more than a dozen NOAA offices, ranging from weather forecasting stations to oceanic monitoring hubs. The agency is also involved in several issues central to the environmental and economic health of Louisiana, such as the annual Gulf dead zone forecast and coastal restoration.
Highlights from the map include the Estuarine Habitats and Coastal Fisheries Center in Lafayette, the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center in Slidell and the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program based in Baton Rouge. 
The map is based on publicly available data from NOAA and other official sources to show where offices and research centers are and what budget cuts could impact. 
“The ‘NOAA in Your State’ tool is one of the most useful government products available to us all,” Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator under President Joe Biden, said in the news release.
NOAA’s data being publicly available is a keystone feature of the agency’s work, Spinrad added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9455-scaled-e1758901930968-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-09-26 11:58:50.725952

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Courtesy of S.C. State Ports Authority)When an Upstate soybean processing facility abruptly shut down in April, South Carolina leaders mobilized to find a way to save the crop and get it to new markets overseas.
Now, the state’s farmers are facing another potential crisis – a trade war with China that threatens to eliminate a key soybean customer just as this year’s crop is ready for harvest.
“Farmers are frustrated and they’re concerned right now,” said Eva Moore, spokeswoman for the S.C. Department of Agriculture. “Without China, it’s a lot harder to get good prices and negotiate good deals.”
China is historically the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, importing more than half of American farmers’ annual harvest. And soybeans are America’s biggest export to China, in terms of value. Last year, China bought $12.6 billion worth of soybeans, the New York Times reported.
But this year, China has not placed any orders for U.S. soybeans – the result of a tariff war between that country and the Trump administration. China is instead buying billions of dollars of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.
“U.S. soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice,” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a written statement. “Soybean farmers are under extreme financial stress … (and) cannot survive a prolonged trade war with our largest customer.”
In South Carolina, soybeans are the largest crop by acreage, with most of the growing centered in the Pee Dee region. There were 380,000 acres harvested in 2024 – that’s 13 million bushels worth $138.2 million, according to the state’s agriculture department.
Fitzhugh Bethea, a Dillon County farmer and chairman of the S.C. Soybean Board, said this year’s harvest is expected to be a little below average, with a projected 7% decline. Couple that with soybean prices that have steadily eroded in recent years, and state farmers are worried.
Imports spur stellar August for SC Ports, but tariff troubles await

Farmers “can go out of business in a season if they can’t sell their 2025 crop,” Moore said.
Stepping up
South Carolina has rallied to help its soybean farmers in the past.
As trade tensions with China heightened this spring, Archer Daniels Midland suddenly announced it would close a soybean processing facility in Kershaw that had served farmers for half a century.
That left many of the state’s farmers with no way to process soybeans in storage from last year’s crop, and – with China’s refusal to buy the U.S. product – nowhere to ship them if they could be processed.
The S.C. State Ports Authority reacted by partnering with the state’s agriculture department and private businesses to move 3 million bushels of those soybeans through Inland Port Dillon in the following months.
The authority found new markets for the soybeans in Malaysia, Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia. Container shipping giants CMA CGM, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd and Ocean Network Express agreed to move 2,800 cargo containers full of soybeans to those markets, leading to a 35% jump in exports through the inland port.
South Carolina’s inland ports provide rail links to move cargo containers from points away from the coast to and from the Port of Charleston. The authority also has an inland port in Greer.
“We went to some of the ocean carriers who are big players into Dillon and sort of just said, ‘We have a situation in South Carolina where a huge demand for beans is going away – we’ve got a surplus – and could you help us?’,” said Byron Miller, the authority’s chief commercial officer. “And they stepped up. They got involved in pricing and ensuring there was an avenue to get those beans to market.”
Soybeans, grains and agricultural products rank as the third-biggest export commodity from the Port of Charleston, with nearly 90,000 containers measured in 20-foot increments leaving the port for foreign markets each year. Soybeans and grains are the top commodity exported from the inland port in Dillon.
“By working together, we were able to quickly develop new soybean markets and make a real difference for South Carolina farmers,” Hugh Weathers, the state’s agriculture commissioner, said in a written statement.

 
Uncertain future
With a new soybean crop ready to be harvested in the next couple of months, the state’s agriculture department plans to work with farmers to try to offset impacts from the trade war with China.
The agency plans to hold a “listening call” with growers to get input and “we’re going to see if there’s something more we can do with the port to ease the problem,” Moore said.
The state Department of Agriculture also has a Growing Agribusiness Fund it can tap for initiatives to help soybean farmers. About $9 million of the $40 million legislators put in the fund in 2023 remains available, she said.
China said this week it won’t buy any U.S. soybeans unless what it terms “unreasonable” retaliatory tariffs of 34% are removed by the Trump administration.
Trade talks are continuing, and a top Chinese trade negotiator met with political and business leaders from the U.S. Midwest earlier this week, signaling a breakthrough could be near.
That would be good news for South Carolina, the nation’s 22nd-largest producer of soybeans, and farmers in the Midwest, where the bulk of U.S. soybeans are grown.
In the meantime, however, the state’s soybean farmers are getting ready for harvest with the world’s top buyer boycotting their crop. That could force them to store their harvest to avoid having to sell soybeans at a huge loss.
The stalemate is also spurring talk at the White House of new federal aid to keep farmers afloat, similar to measures President Donald Trump took in 2019 when the trade war began.
On Thursday, Trump indicated a bailout will come from money collected from tariffs.
“We’re going to take some of that tariff money we’ve made, we’re going to give it to our farmers who are for a little while going to be hurting until the tariffs kick in to their benefit,” Trump told reporters. “So, we’re going to make sure our farmers are in great shape because we’re taking in a lot of money.”
He didn’t offer any specifics.
“If there’s not a trade deal, there has to be some kind of relief for farmers,” Moore said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/soybeans-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 11:58:50.725952

Shapiro, don’t sell Pa. out to polluters",Josephine Gingerich,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/commentary/gov-shapiro-dont-sell-pa-out-to-polluters/,"The state is facing major health harms from fracking, methane gas pipelines, data centers, and oil and gas infrastructure. We need leaders to choose people over polluters.","A complex of data centers in Ashburn, Va. (Photo by Gerville/Getty Images)Pennsylvania is at the epicenter of a dangerous fossil fuel agenda — and unfortunately, Governor Josh Shapiro is paving the way. 
Since taking office, Shapiro has taken no meaningful climate action. Instead, he has advanced fossil fuel interests by fast-tracking permits for so-called “reliable” energy — a phrase used to greenwash gas, biodigesters, and other methane-emitting projects. And he promotes an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, which props up oil and gas under the guise of sustainability. Too often, he sides with polluters over people. 
Our state has been part of the U.S. Climate Alliance since 2019, a coalition committed to a net-zero future by advancing state-led, high-impact climate action. Yet Pennsylvania is America’s second largest extractor of fossil fuels — and no significant climate-mitigating legislation has been established during Shapiro’s tenure as governor. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
President Donald Trump has a bullseye on Pennsylvania shale gas, with promises of liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals, massive AI data centers powered by dedicated gas-fired power plants, and additional false solutions like pyrolysis (burning plastic, which creates toxic emissions) and carbon capture and sequestration (an ineffective and dangerous attempt at storing carbon underground, transported through hazardous pipelines that can poison communities with CO2 gas leaks). These projects only delay the transition to real renewable energy.
Data centers bring the threat of noise, higher electric bills, water pollution, and high water usage. And in Pennsylvania, they also bring the health harms of increased fracking and new gas-fired power plants. Amazon and Blackstone plan to use fracked gas to fuel their data centers. And proposed LNG export terminals bring incredible risks of explosion and pollution to densely populated areas on the East Coast. 
A bill in the state House, HB 502, is being shoehorned into state budget legislation after failing to get out of committee. It allows a centralized board to override municipal land use decisions by issuing a “Certificate of Reliable Energy Supply.” Once that certificate is granted, municipalities are legally barred from taking any action that might “materially impede” the project — even if that action is rooted in zoning law, comprehensive planning, or legitimate public health and safety concerns.

Yet Shapiro’s administration is pushing the bill hard, threatening the autonomy and voices of the people of Pennsylvania. In fact, Article I, Section 27 of Pennsylvania’s constitution — the Environmental Rights Amendment — establishes the people’s right to clean air and pure water, and requires all levels of government, including municipalities, to act as trustees of our natural resources. By stripping towns of their authority to protect residents through zoning and planning, HB 502 prevents them from fulfilling that constitutional duty. Courts have already struck down similar overreach in the Robinson Township case. 
Instead of being a champion for his constituents who are suffering health harms from fossil fuel extraction in the state, Gov. Shapiro has been busy developing alliances and deals with the gas industry, creating significant roadblocks to meaningful climate action. Now, with the announcement from President Trump of over $90 billion coming to Pennsylvania for an AI hub in our state, our communities face major threats of increased pollution and health harms from fracking, methane gas pipelines, data centers, and other oil and gas infrastructure.
We need Gov. Shapiro not to sell us out. Instead, he needs to hold polluters accountable.

That means stop pushing AI data centers powered by fracked gas. It means stop backing LNG exports and false solutions like burning plastic, carbon capture, and hydrogen production from fracked gas. It means lawmakers should respect local control over energy facilities and data centers and means Gov. Shapiro should  make good on promises to address the toxic impacts of fracking and ban road spreading of toxic, radioactive drilling waste.
We’re watching closely. Pennsylvanians demand leadership that centers on genuine community collaboration, real solutions to the health crisis created by fracking, high-impact actions on the climate crisis, and on respect for frontline communities where residents are suffering. 
Pennsylvania can lead the way in creating union jobs, building renewable energy, protecting communities, and ensuring every family has clean air and water.

Without action, the affordability crisis will deepen, and more of our neighbors will be pushed to the brink.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leo Schiff: Wages matter — Making a case for permanently affordable housing in Vermont.","This commentary is by Leo Schiff, of Brattleboro. Schiff is the board chair of the Windham & Windsor Housing Trust.


The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s newly released Out of Reach report offers a sobering reminder of the growing disconnect between wages and the cost of rent in Vermont — and across the nation. It confirms what we experience every day in our work at Windham & Windsor Housing Trust: that hardworking Vermonters, seniors, people with disabilities and caregivers simply cannot afford the cost of a safe, stable home without support.
According to the report, there is no county in the United States where a full-time minimum wage worker can afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at fair market rent. Here in Windham and Windsor Counties, the wage needed to afford such a home is $26 (Windham) and $25 (Windsor) per hour, while the average renter earns far less. The result is that many households are spending more than half of their income just to keep a roof over their heads. That leaves so many in our community dangerously close to crisis — one car repair, medical bill or missed paycheck away from eviction or homelessness.
These are not abstract statistics. These are real people: working families, elders on fixed incomes, single parents juggling multiple jobs and individuals with disabilities. Many cannot work full-time or at all, and the supports they rely on — rental subsidies, housing vouchers and other lifeline programs — are now facing massive proposed federal cuts. Without action, the affordability crisis will deepen, and more of our neighbors will be pushed to the brink.
This is why the Windham & Windsor Housing Trust’s work to develop and maintain permanently affordable housing is more critical than ever. With the recent completion of Central and Main in downtown Windsor, we now have over 900 affordable apartments, and 147 shared equity homes across Windham and Windsor counties. We have 95 more either under construction or in development. Every project is designed with the long-term in mind: built to last with high-efficiency systems, renewable energy where possible and universal accessibility. We often carry out environmental remediation to safely reuse downtown land, contributing to smart growth and sustainability.
What makes our approach unique is that affordability doesn’t expire after 15 or 20 years, as it often does in other states. Our housing remains affordable forever. That means families who move in today — and those who come after them — can count on having a safe, stable home they can afford well into the future. That’s how we preserve economic diversity in our communities, protect people from displacement and ensure public investment continues to pay off for decades.
These developments are not easy. They are highly complex and often financially daunting. But that’s why nonprofits like Windham & Windsor Housing Trust exist — to step in where the market won’t and to deliver lasting impact. Our developments are made possible through innovative public-private partnerships. About 60% of our funding comes from private investment, primarily through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. The remaining 40% is made up of state and federal dollars. These modest public investments leverage millions in private funds — and in return, communities gain long-term housing assets that generate property and school tax revenue each year.
Permanently affordable housing isn’t just a response to crisis. It’s a promise — to today’s Vermonters and the generations to come — that our communities will remain places where everyone can belong, contribute and thrive.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills on Friday announced her official opposition to a statewide referendum that will ask voters if they want to institute tougher gun safety regulations, arguing the proposed red flag law will ultimately undermine public safety.
Question 2 on the November ballot will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
Maine is the only state that has what’s known as a yellow flag law, which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. Red flag laws, known as extreme risk protection orders, are active in twenty-one states, including four in New England. 
Before the Oct. 25, 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, the yellow flag law had been used sparingly as law enforcement had reported it was cumbersome. 
An independent commission investigating the Lewiston tragedy determined that under the current law, local law enforcement had sufficient probable cause to take the perpetrator, Robert Card II, into protective custody and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. That has both fueled calls for stronger protections as well as prompted more frequent use of the yellow flag law.
In an op-ed in the Portland Press Herald, Mills cites the 1,100 times that the yellow flag law has been used to remove weapons and protect individuals and the public. “Our law has been preventing suicide, getting people help and saving lives every day,” she wrote.
“Question 2 would create a new, separate and confusing process that will undermine the effectiveness of the law and endanger public safety along with it,” she added.
After the Maine Legislature failed to pass several more restrictive gun safety measures in the wake of the shooting, the Maine Gun Safety Coalition launched the referendum effort and in January delivered more than 80,000 petition signatures in support of the red flag proposal.

The referendum proposes allowing a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to file a petition, along with an affidavit of facts, for an extreme risk protection order if someone is suspected of posing a significant danger of causing physical injury to themself or another person. That protection order would prohibit the person from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.” 
Advocating in favor of the current model, Mills argues that involving law enforcement early “takes the burden off you as a family member for ‘turning in’ someone who’s close to you” and points out that “law enforcement can access more information” and navigate the court system more easily than members of the public.
The governor also said that “involving law enforcement provides another important level of due process that strengthens the law’s constitutionality.”
In the commentary, Mills explained how Maine’s unique law came together through a consensus process, which she helped lead. 
“Our law is not some cookie cutter measure copied and pasted from another state. It was written by and for Maine people, carefully crafted to include important due process safeguards that protect both public safety and the rights of the individual,” she wrote. “We found common ground on one of the most controversial issues of our time.”
The governor had teased her opposition to a red flag law in her State of the Budget address in January, during which she said, “It is the government’s responsibility, not that of a private citizen, to protect the public from gun violence.”
Earlier this week, advocates and opponents of the referendum effort held a debate on the proposal. 
During the televised town hall, former Public Safety Commissioner Anne Jordan, who also served as executive director of the independent commission on the Lewiston shooting, described the yellow flag law as a “failed” experiment.

(Montana Farmers Union photo)Joining hundreds of other farmers across the country, 14 members of the Montana Farmers Union joined the organization’s legislative fly-in earlier this month in Washington, D.C., to voice concerns about a future farm bill even as tariffs take a toll on the agriculture sector.
The annual event comes as farmer advocacy groups across the country are asking the federal government to reauthorize the Farm Bill, which is how the United States has dictated large portions of the country’s agricultural policy. It has not been reauthorized since 2018, though some parts of it were folded into the “Big Beautiful” reconciliation bill, passed without Democratic support earlier this year. 
That included a measure that allowed single entities to increase the amount of crop insurance coverage they can get. This essentially allowed large corporations to increase the amount of taxpayer funded insurance subsidies they could get and did not benefit smaller farmers, Montana Farmers Union President Walter Schweitzer said Thursday, because it equated to a cap increase.
Crop insurance is where the majority of Farm Bill money goes, and there are ways to fix it, he added.
A step system could be put in place, for example, that would allow a farmer who needs $1 million in insurance coverage could get a higher percentage of that covered by taxpayers than a corporation that needs $30 million in insurance.
Farmers across the country are advocating for the Farm Bill to be reauthorized, saying not having the certainty of the bill is not conducive to an industry that thrives on stability.
Schweitzer has also heard the criticism, mostly coming from progressive circles, that American farmers voted for President Donald Trump and are therefore getting what they asked for.
“I don’t disagree that there’s farm organizations out there that have been very vocal in support of this administration, but their members are really questioning what they did,” Schweitzer said. “I’ve got farmers who are calling me from these other farm organizations that are freaking out about the tariffs.”
Those tariffs continue to be a major concern, Schweitzer said, because it has caused some countries to simply buy agricultural products from other countries. 
Schweitzer is also a supporter for rural mental health care and said stress is impacting those working in the industry. He’s lost several friends this year, all farmers and ranchers, to suicide, he said.
He also sees the general economic situation around American agriculture to be deeply troubling, drawing comparisons to the 1980s Farm Crisis.
“In the ‘80s, we weren’t pissing off our customers, we just made some really bad financial decisions in our ag policies,” Schweitzer said. “But now we’re not only making bad decisions on ag policy, but we’re pissing off all our customers, and our standing in the world is diminishing drastically every second.”
Farmers Union members also are pushing labeling on food, indicating what country it came from as well as what’s called “Right to Repair” legislation, which would allow people to buy parts and repair their own equipment, something that is not always possible.
The other major, ongoing issue related to tariffs, Schweitzer said, is that farmers are not finding places to sell their products. China, which bought $12.3 billion in soybeans last year, has not bought any this year, the New York Times reported.
“Even if we get past this current trade war, even if we get past this current economic situation, I don’t see a very bright future for American agriculture as we need those markets, and we’re going to struggle to get them back worldwide,” Schweitzer said. “Global buyers are going to buy from us as a last resort from here on out.”
Outside Sidney, Sarah Degn is watching the soybean issue play out in front of her.
“Things like the trade war are really hitting home this time of year,” Degn said. “I mean, I’m going to start combining soybeans tomorrow, and I’m not totally sure what’s happening with all of them yet.”
Sidney lost its sugar beet factory several years ago, which prompted a change for farmers in the area. Degn, a member of the Montana Farmers Union, was in the nation’s capital during the fly-in.
“You feel like when you talk to these people and they’re listening and their staff are listening, and you’ve made progress, and then you hear the people at the top say, well, until the President says it’s OK, we can’t do anything,” Degn said. “So you get the feeling they want to help, but they’re waiting for permission.”
Representatives from the Montana Farmers Union met with members of the state’s delegation, including U.S. Reps Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing. Schweitzer said Rep. Downing and Sen. Tim Sheehy were receptive to more legislation around food packaging.
The Farmers Union is pushing for clearer packaging on meat products, which is called “Country of Origin Labeling” or, COOL.
The problem, Schweitzer said, is that some beef raised in other countries is then processed in America, letting those companies slap a United States label on the beef. Regulations on beef differ from the U.S. in other meat-producing countries like Brazil and Mexico.
Quality beef has long been a hallmark of American beef production and while products from other countries would likely be cheaper than domestic meat, Schweitzer thinks the customer will be able to taste the difference.
“I am convinced that they may buy that package one or two times, or they may buy that with they’re pinching pennies and don’t have enough money to buy other products,” Schweitzer said. “But there’s no doubt in my mind, given the choice, they would always prefer to buy beef.”
The labeling push echoes some state legislation discussed during the past session, including a “checkoff” bill that would have created a program to market Montana beef. A similar program for wheat already exists.
Montana Farmers Union priorities are driven by its members and the organization’s annual convention — where that policy is set — on Oct. 31 to Nov.1 in Lewistown.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FarmBill2.0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 11:58:50.725952

May, a West Columbia Republican and founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, has been in jail since his June arrest. His trial was set to begin Oct. 9.
May faced 10 charges of distributing child sexual abuse materials. He agreed to plead guilty to five of those charges, and prosecutors dismissed the remaining five as part of the plea deal.
May is expected to appear in court Monday afternoon to officially plead guilty. He faces between five and 20 years in prison for each of the five counts, plus fines that could amount to more than $285,000 for each charge, according to the plea agreement.
Prosecutors tied an account on messaging app Kik flagged for sending child sexual abuse videos to May’s home Wi-Fi and cellphone, they said previously. After seizing May’s phone and laptop last August, prosecutors determined May was the person behind the Kik account, according to court filings.

A fire at Sugarbush Resort in Warren caused “irreparable damage” to two buildings Wednesday night, the resort said in a social media statement. 
The resort’s golf clubhouse and Hogan’s Pub were engulfed in flames at about 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday, according to the resort’s Facebook post Thursday. No one was injured. 
Fire departments from five towns responded, the resort said. The Vermont State Police also shut down the adjacent Golf Course Road as crews worked to contain the fire.

The three parties signed a memorandum of understanding that they would explore the possibility of siting a TerraPower nuclear reactor in Evergy’s Kansas territory, they announced in a Tuesday news release.
TerraPower, headquartered in Washington, is proposing a Natrium power plant, which uses liquid sodium as a coolant rather than water, according to the company’s website.
“Unlike today’s Light Water Reactors, the Natrium reactor is a 345-megawatt sodium fast reactor coupled with TerraPower’s breakthrough innovation — a molten salt energy storage system, providing built-in gigawatt-scale energy storage,” the website said.
The agreement allows TerraPower and Evergy to evaluate site-specific characteristics for the Natrium power plant and to “explore the Natrium plant’s technical design and ability to support Evergy’s customers,” the release said.
Site selection is based on everything from community support to necessary physical  characteristics, as well as the ability to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure, the news release said.
“My administration has always supported an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach when meeting the energy needs of Kansas citizens and businesses,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in the news release. “We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state, and I’m pleased we’re using innovative methods to do just that.”
Evergy CEO David Campbell said nuclear energy would give the company the opportunity to add reliable energy options that don’t emit greenhouse gases.
“This agreement supports our all-of-the-above energy strategy and will allow us to evaluate the cost, technology, and feasibility of potentially deploying Natrium advanced nuclear plants,” he said in the news release.
Dorothy Barnett, executive director of Climate + Energy Project, said her organization’s mission is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equitably, and she appreciates that advanced nuclear reactors can support part of that mission.
However, she’s concerned about the cost of such a power plant and what that would mean for customer bills.
“I am concerned with what I read about cost to build these advanced nuclear reactors and projects,” she said. “I believe one figure I saw for the Wyoming plant that TerraPower is building, which is 345 megawatts, was $4 billion.”
Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Energy is financing half of that $4 billion cost. The company broke ground in 2024 on the Wyoming plant, the first Natrium plant to be built.
David Toland, lieutenant governor and secretary of commerce, said projects like this one could support the surge in economic activity in Kansas.
“We need to consider all innovative options that strengthen our competitive position while driving down costs for consumers. This project could do both,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1100802-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-26 11:58:50.725952

(Photo by Ed Tibbetts)Fifteen months ago, the people of Davenport got a step closer to greater transparency in the long-running controversy over the city’s decision to pay $1.9 million to three former employees to drop their harassment allegations.
In a June 2024 opinion, a Scott County district judge said, over the city’s objections, that State Auditor Rob Sand was entitled to access the closed sessions of the city council held in connection with this issue. Sand had earlier subpoenaed records, including recordings, of the closed meetings.
In addition to saying Sand was entitled to the sessions to ensure compliance with the law, Judge Jeffrey Bert ordered an “in camera,” or private review by the court, of the meetings in order to exclude attorney work product and material irrelevant to the investigation. He also directed an evidentiary hearing be held to help the court understand what information Sand believed to be relevant.
Insofar as the search for transparency in this case is concerned, not a lot has changed since then.
The city appealed to the Supreme Court and in the interim, a dispute between Sand, a Democrat, and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, a Republican, broke out over who would represent the auditor’s office in the case.
In two weeks, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear their arguments.
This dispute isn’t central to the concerns the people of Davenport have over the city’s decision to settle the claims—and its subsequent attempts to shield itself from public disclosure in the matter.
Still, the dispute between Bird and Sand is no small matter. The questions center on the powers of each office.
Earlier this year, the state auditor’s office told the court it planned to represent itself following a disagreement with the attorney general’s office over how to proceed in the case, citing differences over how to approach the issue of confidential information. (The city’s appeal of the district court ruling claimed the case was a “direct assault” on attorney-client privilege.)
In a brief filed with the high court, through its general counsel, Sand’s office said the city’s appeal isn’t ripe for review, but if the court found otherwise, it should affirm the district judge’s order. Citing state law, the auditor’s office said it has the right to subpoena “all information” and “records” related to the city’s duties, regardless of whether they are privileged.
Bird’s office also says the city’s appeal isn’t ripe for review but adds she “prudently declined” to press an argument relating to abrogating attorney-client privilege with which “the Supreme Court is almost certain to disagree.”
Now the two sides are arguing who gets to represent the auditor’s office before the Supreme Court.

In a filing last month, Bird’s office, citing state law, said she has the “exclusive duty” to represent any state officer in court. Sand’s office, however, argues rather than a dispute over litigation strategy, this is an attempt to limit the role of a fellow constitutional officer. It says Sand seeks potentially privileged information and Bird “does not want the Auditor to be able to access such information.”
Bird’s office, however, has said in a court filing the auditor’s preferred argument “risked an adverse decision that could limit the Auditor’s authority” and that the attorney general’s duty isn’t to represent a particular auditor, but the office of the auditor.
This is happening against a backdrop of previous disputes between Sand and Republicans over the Legislature’s moves to limit his powers. Two years ago, Republicans passed a law that effectively bars Sand from going to court to force resisting state agencies to turn over documents. It also limits the auditor’s ability to access certain personal information.
Amid all this, the people of Davenport continue to wait for whatever findings, if any, Sand’s reaudit might produce.
Sand’s office has said the records from the city’s closed sessions are vital to the investigation. “Without the recordings of the closed sessions, the reaudit ends,” it said in a filing this month.
It’s not clear how long the various issues regarding the closed sessions might be tangled up in the courts. Sand also has announced he is running for governor next year, meaning that, come 2027, Iowa will likely have a new auditor.
What then? Will the new auditor pursue this case if it hasn’t already been concluded—and in what way?
We’re nearing the two-year anniversary of the agreement between the City of Davenport and former City Administrator Corri Spiegel that resulted in paying her $1.6 million to settle her claims.
Since then, citizens, journalists and state officials have sought to drag answers out of the city. I have tended to believe, like Sand, the contents of the city council’s closed sessions are vitally important. In my opinion, they have the potential to shine a brighter light on how these decisions came to be. However, with all that is transpiring, it is not clear to me this light will be forthcoming soon, if it ever shines at all.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier on Friday accused a Democratic state attorney he’s long-feuded with of declining to prosecute pedophiles.
Uthmeier hosted an Orlando press conference Friday morning to castigate Monique Worrell, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties, for failing to prosecute a man who allegedly masturbated in front of children and another man accused of possessing thousands of videos of child pornography.
This was Uthmeier’s second press conference in a month targeting Worrell, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis removed from office in 2023 but subsequently won reelection.
“This is systematic abuse. This is gross negligence,” Uthmeier said, demanding she “reconsider” the dropped charges or he will try to get the case reassigned to another attorney. “[Worrell] took an oath, she’s not delivering on that oath, and we’re going to step up and do what we can to hold her accountable and to protect our citizens.”
Of note, the power to suspend and remove state attorneys lies solely with the governor. The attorney general exercises a mere “superintendent” role over Florida’s 20 elected state attorneys.
Worrell’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Monique Worrell via her webpage
Uthmeier has long-clashed with Worrell. Earlier this month, he hinted that she should be suspended — again — for bringing a second-degree murder case against a women Uthmeier believes acted in self-defense. He recited the Florida Constitution’s ground for suspension of an elected official at a press conference, before asking her to investigate a former Democratic state senator for posting the location of ICE agents.
In April, amid a weeks-long war of words between Uthmeier, accused by her of being “uninformed,” and Worrell, whom he called “soft on crime,” the AG claimed she was ignoring a mounting backlog of cases. When Uthmeier served as DeSantis’ chief of staff, the governor suspended Worrell in August 2023 for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
Despite this, she retook her seat in November 2024 when voters chose her over Andrew Bain, appointed by DeSantis to replace her.
What are the cases that weren’t prosecuted?
According to a letter sent from the attorney general’s office to Worrell, there were two cases involving children that Worrell declined to prosecute. The first involves a man named Kevin Chapman, 61, arrested for lewd and lascivious exhibition in the presence of a child under 16.
“Not only did your office fail to pursue pretrial detention, but it declined to charge him, claiming that the case was ‘not suitable for prosecution,'” Uthmeier wrote. “I strongly encourage you to reconsider dismissing the charge against Chapman.”
The other case Worrell allegedly declined to prosecute was against Thomas Dolgos, who had his electronics searched and seized in June. During the search, Dolgos admitted to possessing child pornography. A preliminary view of his devices suggested thousands of images of child pornography, the letter says.
The Office of Statewide Prosecution assumed the case, but Uthmeier claims that an attorney from Worrell’s office “inexplicably” dismissed all charges and discharged Dolgos’ bond, freeing him. Dolgos was apprehended at the Canada border and the statewide prosecutor charged him with an additional 48 counts of child pornography.
“Your office’s dismissal of Dolgos’ charges was an unacceptable mistake,” Uthmeier wrote. “Your office should never dismiss a case OSP is managing. … At best, it suggests a lack of adequate training in your office. Please address this deficiency and make sure it does not happen again.”

Williams is one of two members of the Jackson Police Department’s neighborhood enhancement team, or NET. Formed in early 2024, the officers lead efforts to clean up illegal dump sites across the city.

The duo performs daily patrols around Jackson, surveying common locations where people dump their trash, such as Shaw Road or Greenhill Place in southwest Jackson. Williams said in recent months, he’s noticed that a larger number of people who have been charged with dumping are traveling from outside of the city to dump sites in Jackson. They choose areas that are low-traffic without visible streetlights or cameras.
“It’s secluded,” Williams said, as he steered one of the team’s patrol vehicles down a road overgrown with weeds. “This is the perfect spot for them to come and take three to five minutes, dump some stuff and keep it rolling.”

On Aug. 12, the Jackson City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that created additional penalties for illegal dumping, including stiffer jail time, a minimum of 32 days, and the immediate seizure of the vehicle used for dumping. 
“This is not just about punishing offenders; it’s about protecting our people, our neighborhoods, and our pride. We want a Jackson that’s cleaner, brighter, and safer, and today’s vote is a step toward that vision,” Ward 4 councilman and council president Brian Grizzell said in a statement after the meeting.

Officer Gloria Blue, the other half of NET, said they collect a wide range of debris from the streets, such as mattresses, bookshelves, carpets and paint materials.
“Anything you can renovate, anything you can take out of a house, they dump,” Blue said.
In recent months, Blue said she’s seen a decrease in large items, such as furniture, they’ve had to pick up. Hinds County supervisors and the police department have placed cameras on streets in south and west Jackson, such as Glen Erin Street or Lindbergh Drive, deterring would-be offenders from dumping.
“It has really slowed down. Now, we’ll probably have one or two couches every couple weeks, but it used to be every single day,” Blue said.

One initiative JPD has implemented is the Clean Sweep Program, allowing people who are caught dumping the opportunity to clean up the mess they made and reduce their fines. Many people who receive fines aren’t able to pay them, Williams said. One of the JPD neighborhood enhancement team’s main goals is to prosecute people who are guilty of illegal dumping. 
 “We investigate to make arrests,” Williams said. “We don’t just do clean-up. We investigate.”

NET also works in collaboration with the city of Jackson to enforce ordinances surrounding dumping and eyesores in the community, such as hoards of items in a yard or rubber tires piled high.
“We have to call Solid Waste and code enforcement for anything that we can’t get that’s on private property,” Blue said.

She said that while NET does respond to tips from concerned residents, many of the sites they clear are from their dedicated surveillance of the city.
“Every now and then, we may get a call about something new,” Blue said. “But it’s an everyday cycle.”

Andy Beshear has signed two emergency regulations updating policies for restrictive housing, previously called isolation, for the state’s Department of Juvenile Justice. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer) Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has signed two emergency regulations updating policies for restrictive housing, previously called isolation, for the state’s Department of Juvenile Justice. 
Beshear announced the regulations Thursday and called them a strong plan to change the system, which has received criticism in recent years over care of youth offenders. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a civil rights investigation into the conditions at eight of the state’s youth detention centers and one development center.
The governor’s emergency regulations require leadership within the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) to review and approve time limits on restrictive housing for youth offenders, including more frequent medical and mental health evaluations, and training on the new policy for all DJJ staff who interact with youth. 
“For years, the juvenile justice system was overlooked, and now we’re making sweeping changes to overhaul the system to enhance safety and help more kids reach the second chance they deserve,” Beshear said in a statement. “From supporting the hardworking DJJ staff who show up every day to offering more opportunities for youth and addressing needs like mental health, I am proud of the progress we’re making.”
The regulations say that the federal justice department “recommended that DJJ make changes to its regulations and policies governing the use of restrictive housing and protective custody placements.” 
Kentucky Republican Auditor Allison Ball, who has battled the governor on a host of issues in recent months, said in a statement Thursday night that she was “pleased” to see his changes following a 2024 audit from her office and the investigation by the Biden administration. 
“The audit revealed harsh and alarming conditions in DJJ facilities,” Ball said. “Kentucky’s youth deserve better, and my office will closely monitor whether these regulations actually address the findings of my audit.”
Ball’s report said juvenile detention facilities are “significantly understaffed,” leading to “high levels of overtime” that “negatively impact recruitment and retention.” It also found the Detention Division of DJJ “lacks a unified strategic direction,” as facilities and major departments are operating in “silos” and “conflicting communication” led to confusion “regarding its detention mission.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1809-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 10:59:23.498332

Court records indicate licensed practical nurse Tanya Lynn Jordan, 46, of West Liberty, was charged in July 2024 with tampering with records and felony theft of the narcotic hydrocodone.
Prosecutors alleged Jordan was working as a nurse at Cedar County’s Crestview Specialty Care when, on multiple occasions, she charted that she had given a resident of the home hydrocodone but kept the drugs for her own use.

In January 2025, Jordan agreed to a plea deal that in April 2025 resulted in a dismissal of the theft charge and a conviction on the misdemeanor tampering-with-records charge. She was sentenced to two years of probation.
Five months later, on Sept. 10, 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing, imposed an emergency adjudicative order in the case. Citing the need to prevent or avoid “immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare,” the board immediately suspended Jordan’s license to practice nursing in Iowa.
At the same time, the board formally charged Jordan with misappropriating medications of a patient or clinic, falsifying records related to the practice of nursing, committing an act that might adversely affect the welfare of a patient, and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the practice of nursing.
Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Jordan for comment.

Sharice Davids, the Democrat serving the 3rd District, is the target of Republicans who want to redraw congressional district maps to make it easier to defeat Davids in 2026. In this image, Davids speaks to supporters Nov. 5, 2024, in Overland Park while winning reelection to a new two-year term. (Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Maneuvering by Republicans to convene a special legislative session in November to realign the state’s four congressional districts prompted U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids to dust off her 2022 playbook to fend off the GOP’s last attempt to gerrymander her out of office.
Davids was elected in 2018 by Republicans, Democrats and independents in a 3rd District dominated by voters in Wyandotte and Johnson counties. She won reelection by double digits in 2022 and 2024, despite efforts by Kansas GOP legislators to undercut Davids by removing the northern half of Wyandotte County from the 3rd District and adding three rural counties.
Davids, who is the only woman, Native American and Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, denounced the new gerrymandering campaign under development by Kansas Republicans. She said advance work on a legislative session to transform the state’s 3-1 partisan split into a 4-0 GOP monolith was designed to appease President Donald Trump.
“Let’s be clear. Kansans deserve fair representation. Not backroom deals,” Davids said. “Republicans in Topeka know their politically motivated plan to once again silence Kansans and gerrymander the state isn’t popular, which is why they’re trying to do it in secret.”
She said sprinkling Johnson County voters across multiple GOP-controlled districts would require Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins to break commitments to a map keeping Johnson County united as a community of interest. In 2022, Masterson and Hawkins said it was fair to have Johnson County as the core of the Kansas City-area’s 3rd District.
“They are breaking their promise to not split up Johnson County and putting their political futures and Donald Trump’s demands ahead of Kansans’ voices,” Davids said. “Voters, not politicians, should choose their representatives.”
 
Sarnecki 100% on board
Philip Sarnecki, a Johnson County businessman and Republican candidate for governor, said there should be no hesitation by the Legislature to deliver for Trump.
“I met with President Trump’s political team at the White House … and discussed redistricting in Kansas,” Sarnecki said. “I am 100% in favor of redrawing the congressional map and adding a Republican seat in Congress.”
Masterson, an Andover Republican and also a candidate for governor, told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that work of organizing a special session in Topeka — likely Saturday, Nov. 8 — to engage in reapportionment was a matter of “working out the details.” He told the Topeka Capital-Journal it was “disingenuous at best” for Gov. Laura Kelly to demand the Legislature convene public meetings to gather input on how congressional maps might be redrawn ahead of 2026 elections.
“If our congressional delegation, particularly our Republican delegation, is united behind it, I don’t see why we wouldn’t take it up,” Masterson told Fox4 in Kansas City, Missouri.
Hawkins, a Wichita lawmaker seeking the Republican nomination for state insurance commissioner, said “we’re not there” yet on formally adopting a framework for a special session on reapportionment. Hawkins, as well as Masterson, would be better positioned to earn Trump’s endorsement if they delivered on redistricting in Kansas to undermine Davids.
Typically, Kansas governors would call the Legislature into special session. The House and Senate leadership could bypass tradition by gathering petition signatures from two-thirds of the Senate and House.
If the Legislature were to produce a map improving odds of a Republican sweep of the four U.S. House districts, the legislation would likely be vetoed by Kelly. The Legislature would need two-thirds majorities for an override — 84 of 125 members of the House and 27 of 40 members of the Senate. The GOP leadership in both chambers could afford to lose no more than four Republican members to complete an override and implement a new map — pending an inevitable lawsuit.
 
Reapportionment skeptics
Rep. Mark Schreiber, a Republican from Emporia, said he wouldn’t be among GOP lawmakers backing a new map. He said redrawing Kansas’ congressional boundaries outside the regular 10-year cycle tied to the U.S. Census couldn’t be justified.
“I’ve not heard a good reason yet to go back and redistrict. What we’re doing now is playing with the rules of the game. I just don’t see there’s wide (public) support for it,” Schreiber said.
Sen. Brenda Dietrich, a Topeka Republican, said remapping could regrettably make Republican U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt more vulnerable to a challenge in the 2nd District.
“I always worry about unintended consequences,” she said.
She said diluting influence of moderates in Johnson County also could trigger a backlash against Republican candidates in Kansas House races in 2026.
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat campaigning for governor, said the public should contact state representatives or senators to register opposition to this unique round of congressional redistricting. She said the GOP’s strategy was about “making it easier for extremists to take control.”
“This proposal aims to dilute the votes of the hundreds of thousands of Kansans. There is no reason to redistrict mid-decade except to rig the system in one party’s favor over another. That’s not democracy. That’s cheating,” she said.
Kansans haven’t been clamoring for a new congressional map, said Sen. Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa. She said hypothetical maps for Kansas illustrate GOP electoral goals could be achieved by splitting the 3rd District into two or three sections.
“Why redraw the map the Republicans celebrated as fair just three years ago?” Sykes said.
In a Kansas City Star story, Rep. Bill Sutton, R-Gardner, said “it’s a questionable decision to redesign the districts anytime there’s a change in president.”
Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, told the Star that breaking up Johnson County to shift political power “might end up maybe giving a court challenge a little bit more chance of succeeding.”
 
The Supreme Court
Legal challenges of a Kansas congressional map could wind up in front of the Kansas Supreme Court. It would be a near repeat of a battle leading to a 4-3 decision in 2022 upholding constitutionality of the GOP’s gerrymandered congressional map, which cut Wyandotte County in half and placed Lawrence in the 1st District.
Justice Caleb Stegall said in the majority opinion that lack of direction in the Kansas Constitution or Kansas law forbidding use of partisan political reasoning to shape congressional districts left the state’s highest court no alternative than approving the 2022 map.
“The use of partisan factors in district line drawing is not constitutionally prohibited,” Stegall wrote. “If the redistricting process is intended to have ‘substantial political consequences’ it is no surprise that our court has consistently rejected pleas to establish a bright line prohibition on politics in the redistricting process.”
He said the Legislature was free to adopt clear standards limiting partisan gerrymandering in Kansas. Such clear standards would provide the judiciary with tools to adjudicate claims of excessive partisan gerrymandering, he added.
There were two minority opinions from state Supreme Court justices. One was written by Justice Eric Rosen and the second by Justice Dan Biles. Biles’ dissent was joined by Rosen and Justice Melissa Standridge.
“The majority denies Kansans the very thing our founders envisioned: A people’s government that fervently guards the people’s equal benefit from and access to the law — regardless of what the narrower-in-scope center power has to say about it,” Rosen said.
Biles, with Rosen and Standridge concurring, said a judicial retreat wasn’t the answer when state actions crossed constitutional boundaries.
“Courts must intervene because a desire to harm politically disfavored groups is not a legitimate government interest,” Biles said.
Stegall’s majority opinion in 2022 was joined by Chief Justice Marla Luckert and Justices K.J. Wall and Evelyn Wilson. It could be significant, if there were a fresh challenge to a new congressional map, that Wilson retired from the Supreme Court. On Sept. 16, she was replaced by Justice Larkin Walsh.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/KVP-10-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-26 10:59:23.498332

Travis Beal Jacobs, 89, Fletcher D. Proctor Professor Emeritus of American History at Middlebury College, the son of Albert C. and Loretta Beal Jacobs, died at his home in Bridport, VT on September 16th, surrounded by his loved ones.
He graduated from Deerfield Academy and Princeton University ’58 cum laude. Planning to attend Columbia Law School, at the last minute he switched to the graduate program in American History for his Ph.D. 1965 he joined the faculty at Middlebury College and soon began teaching a popular two-semester lecture course on 20th Century American History. He served as Department Chair for seventeen years. “One of the first . . . chairs to embrace the College’s aspirations in minority recruiting,” he was ”certainly the most conspicuously successful.” His publications include America and the Russo-Finnish Winter War, 1939-1940; co-editing Navigating the Rapids, 1918-1971, the Diaries of a Adolf A. Berle, a FDR Brain Truster; and Eisenhower at Columbia. He also edited the Middlebury College General Catalogue: Bicentennial Edition, 2000, a Who Was Who and Who’s Who of the College. He received several Earhart Foundation Fellowships; taught in Tunis on a Fulbright; served on the Presidential Studies Quarterly Editorial Board; and attended many Salzburg Seminars on American Studies. He retired as Fletcher D. Proctor Emeritus of American History in 2008.
He spent many summers on Chappaquiddick Island, Edgartown, MA., many of them at his family’s Stanford White house at Green Pastures on Katama Bay. Since 2014 he spent time throughout the year at Chazy Lake in the Adirondacks.
An early member of Middlebury Town and Gown, he regularly attended the lunches, until his health faded, and he had delivered a handful of talks. He also enjoyed the Addison-Bridport Horse Thief Society. He was president of the Henry Sheldon Museum during the capital campaign that led to the Paris Fletcher Community Center; he remained a strong supporter of its Research Center with its valuable Vermont history collections and in 2021 he established the J. Robert Maguire Research Fund. He leaves unfinished a study of the late Vermonter Robert T. Stafford, former Governor, U.S. Congressman, and U.S. Senator. Early in the 21st Century he and his traveling companion, Constance Carroll, took a series of trips to Europe, ranging from France to Hungary, from Italy, Sicily, Tunisia and Malta to Russia and Finland.
His family is grateful for assistance from Addison Home, Health, and Hospice, and UVM Oncology(?). Besides his parents, he was predeceased by two older sisters and two former wives, one Eleanor T. Morison, the mother of his sons T. Beal Jacobs, Jr., and Holmes M. Jacobs who own Two Brothers Tavern in Middlebury. He had three grandchildren who he lovingly adored, Jackson, Piper and Sally Jacobs. A Memorial will be held at Saint Stephens Episcopal Church in Middlebury, VT on October 18th.

The Sussex Central Golden Knights travel to Abessinio Stadium for a Friday night clash with Salesianium.
Both squads enter the contest following losses in their last game.
Hodgson defeated the Golden Knights, 44-34, at home, providing Sussex Central with its first loss of the season. The Silver Eagles scored their season high in points behind the strong play of junior quarterback Kevin Browning. The Golden Knights received impressive contributions from their own QB, Josiah Cannon, throwing for over 70 yards a touchdown. Running back Will Harmon contributed over 150 yards on the ground for Sussex Central as well.
Sallies hasn’t played since September 19 when they traveled to Malvern Prep High School in Pennsylvania for the second of two straight games against out-of-state opponents. Sallies lost that game by three points, twelve days after they fell to LaSalle Prep, who are currently undefeated in the Philadelphia Catholic League. Salesianium is 1-0 against Delaware competition, beginning its season with a victory over Red Lion.
The two teams haven’t played in a regular-season matchup since 2022. Sussex Central won that meeting, 7-0, in a low-scoring defensive battle. Just last year, the two squads met in the DIAA semifinals. Sallies defeated the Golden Knights by 26 in that game to advance to the state championship game, where they ultimately fell to Middletown.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
States are ramping up efforts to get residents to switch from fossil-fuel-fired heating systems to all-electric heat pumps. Now, they’ve got a big new tool kit to pull from.


Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, released an 80-page action plan laying out key strategies to turbocharge heat-pump deployment. Individual states are already putting many of these tactics to the test.


California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together committed to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. By 2040, that percentage is to climb to 90%.


The goals are essential for addressing climate change. Buildings are directly responsible for 13% of U.S. carbon emissions, in part due to the fossil fuels burned on-site to heat indoor air and water. All-electric heat pumps can do those jobs running on clean power.


The NESCAUM action plan comes as the Trump administration clings tenaciously to fossil fuels. In recent months, the federal government has rolled back energy-efficiency standards for appliances, imposed chaotic tariffs that are raising costs for consumers, and put an early expiration date on the $2,000 federal tax credit that helps homeowners afford heat pumps.


Despite these headwinds, the report shows that ​“states are still finding creative ways to move forward,” said Emily Levin, policy and program director for NESCAUM.


HVAC heat pumps are routinely two to four times as efficient as gas furnaces, capable of heating and cooling interiors using the same physics that refrigerators employ to chill your cucumbers. Heat-pump water heaters work the same way and are three to five times as efficient as gas water heaters. By eschewing fossil fuels, these technologies improve air quality and typically save people money over the long term, even if, on average, they cost significantly more up-front than conventional heating systems. (At least one startup, though, is trying to change that.)

Heat pumps are slowly catching on. In the U.S., the units outsold gas furnaces by their biggest-ever margin last year, but their share of the market is still modest. Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 2021, heat pumps accounted for about 25% of the combined shipments of gas furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioners, the three largest reported HVACcategories. In 2024, they’d risen to about 32%.


“No matter how you look at it, there are still a lot of gas furnaces being sold, there are still a lot of one-way central air-conditioners being sold — all of which could really become heat pumps,” Levin said.


Produced in consultation with state agencies, environmental justice organizations, and technical and policy experts, the NESCAUM report lays out a diverse set of more than 50strategies — both carrots and sticks — covering equity and workforce investments, obligations to reduce carbon, building standards, and utility regulation. A wide range of decision-makers, often in collaboration, can pull these levers — from utility regulators to governor’s offices, state legislatures, and energy, environment, labor, and economic development agencies. Here are six recommendations from the report that stand out.



Make heat pumps more accessible to lower-income and renter households. A number of barriers need to be overcome to make heat pumps available to these groups, who often struggle to afford the appliances or lack the autonomy to install them. For example, contractors can’t put heat pumps in homes with hazards like mold, lead, asbestos, and rotten beams, but the process to address these problems can itself cost tens of thousands of dollars. Philadelphia’s Built to Last programcoordinates aid to carry out these necessary pre-electrification repairs. On the other side of the country, California is launching a program this fall to install heat pumps in qualifying low- and moderate-income homes — for free. Notably, owners of low-income multifamily buildings can also use the program to upgrade their tenants’ heating systems, but they must agree to keep rent from increasing more than 3% per year for up to 10 years after the project.
Set an all-electric standard for new buildings. States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to. New York recently became the first state to require that most new buildings be electric only, making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31.
Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures. Such standards require building owners to meet specific annual limits on energy use or carbon emissions and bring them down over time, or face penalties. Several states and cities have already developed these rules. Maryland, for one, stipulates that owners of most edifices 35,000 square feet or greater must report their CO2 emissions starting this year, hit standards by 2030, and fully ditch fossil-fueled appliances by 2040.
Leverage emissions rules that improve air quality and protect public health. For example, in 2023, the San Francisco Bay Area air district, home to more than 7 million people, set landmark rules requiring that new residential water and space heaters don’t spew health-harming nitrogen oxides, starting in 2027 and 2029, respectively. Heat pumps fit the bill. Switching to the tech nationwide could avert more than 2,600 premature deaths annually, according to electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America.
Push utilities to deliver clean heat.States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings. For example, in 2021, Colorado adopted a first-in-the-nation clean-heat law doing just that. Lawmakers also mandated that utilities file their implementation plans for approval. In 2024, regulators greenlit a $440 million proposal from Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, which included electrifying 200,000 homes with heat pumps by 2030. Maryland is developing a similar standard.
Reform electricity rates so that they incentivize zero-emissions heating. Households with heat pumps tend to use more electricity than other customers, which means they pay disproportionately for fixed costs to maintain the grid on their energy bills. Utilities can correct that imbalance with adjusted rates. For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps. Elizabeth Mahony, commissioner of the state’s Department of Energy Resources, said she expects the new rates to save heat-pump owners on average $540 per year.

NESCAUM’s Levin stressed that the report is ​“a menu — not a recipe.” Each state will need to consider its own goals and constraints to pick the approaches that fit it best, she added.


Still, ​“I see [heat-pump electricity] rates as one of the areas that’s most promising,” Levin said. Massachusetts’ reforms ​“are really going to change their customer economicsto make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”


When done right, rate design also avoids the need for states to find new funding. ​“You’re not raising costs on anybody, you’re only reducing costs,” Levin said. At a time when households are seeing energy prices rise faster than inflation, the tactic could have widespread political appeal, she noted.


NESCAUM plans to check back in with states and report out on their progress each year, Levin said. ​“The cool thing about our work is that we bring states together to learn from one another,” she added. ​“Part of making this transition happen more rapidly is lifting up the things that are really working well.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Heat-pumps-in-Hudson.jpeg.webp,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

Without action, they warn, out-of-pocket costs could increase dramatically.","MASSACHUSETTS IS ALREADY BRACING for significant health care disruptions stemming from Republicans’ sweeping tax bill that cuts Medicaid funding, and policymakers are worried that even more residents will soon feel added strain because of federal inaction. 
A pandemic-era tax credit that has helped millions of Americans pay for health insurance is set to expire at the end of the year. Many Democrats, joined by state marketplace administrators and activists, are mounting an all-out blitz in support of extending the Biden-era aid as the threat of a federal government shutdown fast approaches. 
But Republicans who control Congress so far have not indicated they plan to extend the so-called “enhanced premium tax credits,” at least not as part of a funding bill to keep government open past September 30. That deadline might be the last, best chance for supporters to get the tax credits renewed.  
Without action, Massachusetts health care leaders and advocates warn the impacts could be dire. Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters could face higher health insurance premiums next year. Some might need to pay more than three times as much to maintain roughly the same level of coverage. State budget-writers could wind up with a quarter-billion-dollar headache, too.  
“This feels like it would be a real gut punch to working families across the state if this was to be rolled back,” said Alex Sheff, senior director of policy and government relations for the advocacy group Health Care for All. 
Officials at the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state’s health insurance marketplace, estimate that more than 337,000 residents will experience higher costs if Congress allows the credits to expire. The annual tax credit loss in Massachusetts for residents would amount to $425 million, or an average of $1,364 per person, according to a fact sheet the Connector began circulating this month as its leaders pressed for action. 
The federal tax credits not only helped Massachusetts residents afford health care, but they shifted some of the financial burden from the state, freeing up funding to expand subsidies to a larger swath of people who need help. If policymakers want to keep the lowest-cost plans available to Massachusetts consumers at roughly similar rates, they might need to kick in hundreds of millions more in state funding to make up for lost federal dollars. 
State officials have spent recent weeks notifying residents that they might lose significant subsidies, and face greater expenses, if the program sunsets. 
“Letting people know the prospect that their ability to continue to afford coverage is in question as a result of congressional inaction so far is a worrying place to be in as a marketplace,” said Connector executive director Audrey Morse Gasteier. “The clock is really ticking.” 
Sheff said without the tax credits, about 26,000 Connector members will likely see a “very dramatic” increase in their out-of-pocket costs for health coverage, and more than 300,000 others will experience “some increase in their premiums.” 
Some of the broader impacts could be a spillover. If younger, healthier people decide to drop coverage altogether because of the price increase, the remaining membership becomes, on average, older and sicker — populations that have higher insurance costs. 
“Even if you weren’t receiving a premium tax credit, your premiums are going to go up as a result of this,” Sheff said. 
The credits cap out-of-pocket premiums at up to 8.5 percent of a household’s income, depending on how much they earn. As a result, there’s a wide range of potential cost impacts that could result from the expiration depending on a family’s size, income, and other factors. 
Health policy nonprofit KFF published a calculator tool that allows users to see an estimate of what they might need to pay with and without the enhanced premium tax credits in place. 
Financial upheaval could stretch beyond consumers. Officials aim to keep ConnectorCare premiums low, and for the past four years, they’ve used the enhanced premium tax credits to offset the costs of doing so. If the credits evaporate, the state itself would need to find $255 million to keep the highly subsidized premiums at current levels. 
It’s not clear if the Legislature would support that extra funding injection at a time when budget-writers are struggling with other challenges, some inflicted by previously enacted federal funding cuts. 
The end of the enhanced tax credits would also reduce federal dollars that were partly funding a pilot program state lawmakers and Gov. Maura Healey created to make more people eligible for ConnectorCare. 
Because of the savings the tax credits afforded Massachusetts, Beacon Hill temporarily expanded eligibility for ConnectorCare, which provides low-cost health plans, from 300 percent of the federal poverty level to 500 percent, through 2026.    
But if the tax credits expire, Bay Staters in the 400 percent to 500 percent FPL bracket — equivalent to an annual income between $128,600 and $160,750 for a family of four — would no longer qualify. Morse Gasteier said that includes about 19,000 people. 
Right now, with enhanced tax credits in place, consumers in that range pay a minimum premium of $274 per month for ConnectorCare coverage. If the credits evaporate, they would need to pay at least $1,100 per month in premiums for a roughly equivalent plan with similarly low copays and cost-sharing, according to Sheff. 
He stressed it’s “unlikely” that consumers will absorb those costs. Most will instead downgrade to a lower-tier plan with less owed in monthly premiums but higher copays and deductibles. 
Sheff said even someone who shifts to a mid-tier plan might still owe premiums “more than double” what they pay for ConnectorCare. 
The credits first launched in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, and Congress extended them through the end of 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Millions of Americans now use the credits to offset their health insurance costs, including close to four in five Bay Staters who get coverage through the Connector. 
Hannah Frigand, Health Care for All’s senior director of help line and public programs, said she regularly receives calls from Bay Staters who are able to use savings generated by the tax credit to pay for food, rent, and other basic necessities. 
“It’s very worrisome to think about the situation that people will be in if these tax credits go away,” she said. 
Although the sunset date is the end of the year, extension supporters argue that the inflection point will arrive much sooner. 
Open enrollment begins on November 1, at which point consumers will be able to shop around and compare plans. Morse Gasteier wants resolution before then so enrollees can get a clear estimate of next year’s costs, rather than make decisions based on projected massive costs. 
“Once you lose people by presenting sticker shock to them about what their health coverage costs will be, it’s very difficult to get them back,” Morse Gasteier said.  
“Just because you could make this decision closer to December 31 doesn’t mean that there’s not damage done by people getting scared away by really high health care costs,” she added. 
Some marketplace leaders have been pushing for Congress to act by September 30 to avoid any spillover into open enrollment. 
That’s also the end of the federal fiscal year and the date by which Congress and President Trump need to agree on a funding deal to avert a government shutdown. 
The credits appear to be a sticking point in increasingly tense talks in Washington, DC. 
US Rep. Lori Trahan said she and fellow Democrats plan to use the government funding debate as leverage to push Republicans, who narrowly control both branches of Congress, to extend the tax credits. 
“We’ve made it very clear that the Republicans need Democratic votes in order to pass a [continuing resolution] and their appropriations bills, and we aren’t going to stand for ripping health care away from millions of people and rubber-stamp a budget that does that,” Trahan told CommonWealth Beacon. 
GOP leaders have suggested Congress can wait until after the end-of-month deadline to decide the fate of the enhanced credits. 
“I think that we are open to the conversation about what we do with the Obamacare premium tax credits,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said earlier this month, according to NBC News. “That’s something in which members, Republican senators and I think, for that matter, Republican House members have an interest, as well, but this isn’t the place to do that.” 
Some congressional Republicans have suggested any potential agreement on extending the aid should consider reforms to the program to prevent “fraud,” Axios reported. 
Healey and 17 other governors, all Democrats, wrote to congressional leaders last week urging prompt action to extend the tax credits, calling it “one of the simplest, most effective steps Congress can take to keep health care affordable.” 
“If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for health care, rent, or groceries,” they wrote. “Hard-working American families, older Americans not yet on Medicare, small business owners, and rural communities — where marketplace coverage is often the only option —  will be hit the hardest.” 
Even if Congress winds up embracing the program, leaders at the Connector are bracing for a challenging open enrollment period marked by disruption. 
The federal reconciliation package sometimes referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” dramatically overhauled health care spending and eligibility. Altogether, the new law could force about 80,000 Connector members — about one-quarter of the current pool — to lose coverage, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

At the state Capitol this year, lawmakers, policy experts, housing advocates and others said the term “housing shortage” at least 30 times in committee hearings and floor speeches — underscoring how California’s housing crisis remains one of the state’s top issues.
But what exactly is a housing shortage, and how bad is it in California? The answer depends on who you ask, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
One analyst told Ben that a housing shortage is “the gap between the housing you have and the housing you need.” But calculating the “housing you need” is based on various factors that not everyone agrees on.
This has led to estimates on California’s housing crunch ranging between a mere 56,000 units to as much as 8.2 million.
A decade ago, in one of the first attempts to put a hard number to the state’s housing problem, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office calculated that California would have had to construct 2.7 million additional units over the prior 30 years to keep the state’s housing cost inflation on par with the rest of the U.S.
A year later, consulting firm McKinsey & Company reported that it would take 3.5 million homes to close California’s housing gap — a figure then-Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom used when he campaigned for governor, pledging to build that many units by 2025. (Spoiler alert: That didn’t happen.)
Despite the imperfect science, Daniel McCue of Harvard University said that it’s worth noting that the general consensus around California’s housing crisis is that it’s huge.

McCue, a researcher at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies: “Whether it’s one-and-a-half million or five-and-a-half million, these are big numbers. … There’s so much to do. There’s so far to go.”

How effective were these resentencing policies?

A recidivism analysis on California’s resentencing policies implemented over the last decade sheds new light on the effectiveness of the state’s efforts to reshape its criminal justice system and reduce its prison population, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich. 
The report, released Wednesday, details recidivism rates for five notable resentencing policies that were implemented under Govs. Jerry Brown and Newsom from 2012 and 2022. Under all five policies, about 12,000 people were resentenced and 9,500 were released, with Black and Latino people making up the majority of those released.
It’s important to note that the report includes one-year recidivism outcomes. The standard timeline to determine recidivism is three years, which only two of the five policies are old enough to measure.
The state agency’s legal director says the report shows how the policies are successful for decreasing the prison population without increasing risks to the public. But some district attorneys critical of the agency argue that the policies harm victims, law enforcement and public safety.

St. Louis University’s PRiME Center, a nonpartisan education think tank, held a half-day conference on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia Thursday to dig into how the state calculates academic growth and celebrate high-growth districts.
“We are really interested in schools that are moving kids the most,” PRiME executive director Collin Hitt told reporters. “We want to do better than we are.”
Hitt believes Missouri has the best formula for calculating academic growth, and the data generated by the formula can help the state identify the best teaching practices.
“You would not be able to see the impact (educators) have on students if we didn’t have growth,” he said.
Education Commissioner Karla Eslinger told conference attendees that growth sees beyond standardized test scores.
“We all have standards, and we want all our kids to meet those standards,” she said. “But one of the things we truly have to pay attention to is the progress they are making towards those standards.”
Missouri’s growth model shows educators how much learning their students accomplished in the school year relative to others in the state. A score of zero doesn’t mean a child has not learned anything but instead indicates that their growth was average.
The formula’s architect Eric Parsons, an economics professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said growth is a “more equitable” accountability measure than tracking average test scores. Districts with high achievement levels tend to be wealthier, but high growth is seen in all areas of the state and all socioeconomic levels.
When Parsons graphed growth levels against poverty, there was no correlation. Overall achievement, though, largely increased alongside wealth.
Data also showed no correlation between achievement levels and growth scores, meaning that expanding students’ knowledge is as hard for low-achieving schools as it is for high achievers.
Parsons received an influx of questions about the formula following the state’s transition to a new accountability model three years ago. Growth was once a small factor in schools’ report cards but now accounts for a quarter of their scores.
Administrators speaking at the conference said questions have not completely disappeared but are now primarily concerned with how growth scores are translated into the school accountability points system.
“Districts are wondering how (education officials) are applying the growth model, which is obviously a great model, into those growth points because it does cause some confusion,” Gainesville R-5 School District Superintendent Justin Gilmore said during a panel discussion. “We need to dig deeper into how the growth model is being utilized by the department.”

Now in long-term recovery, Denson on Thursday helped distribute naloxone, a life-saving medication that reverses opioid overdoses. She thinks that if the people she was around back then had had some doses available, they could’ve brought her breathing back.
“They might have rather used this than immorally just leaving me like I was at the time,” she said.
On Thursday, volunteers across Mississippi distributed free boxes of naloxone during Save a Life Day in an effort to combat stigma. 
Denson is the operations coordinator for Grace House, a recovery residence for women in Hinds County. She is also a peer navigator for Mississippi Harm Reduction Initiative and one of the Hinds County organizers for Save a Life Day. She and a crew of volunteers handed out naloxone, fentanyl testing strips, free pizza and other resources outside of St Luke’s United Methodist Church in Jackson.

One volunteer was Glen Watt, who is in recovery and originally from Crystal Springs. He offered to help because he wanted to give back to the community. 
“It’s an ongoing epidemic. It’s not just something you sweep under the rug,” he said.
From his experience, many people in Mississippi don’t know about naloxone. He said he used to be in that group. Watt said someone in his family still struggles with addiction, and he hoped to take some naloxone to them.
In Rankin County, Pearl resident Emilee Shell planned to distribute naloxone, drug test strips and more. 
Shell is the Save a Life Day county organizer for Rankin County, programs director for Mississippi Impact Coalition and director of Grace House. She is in long-term recovery. She used to work at a treatment center and said she has lost several loved ones to overdoses. 
Though she was not participating on behalf of the Mississippi Impact Coalition, she said Save a Life Day aligns with her organization’s mission. 
“Oftentimes, our communities are left without support or resources. So carrying naloxone and offering harm reduction, it’s not just public health,” she said. “We believe it’s public love.”

Originating in West Virginia, Save a Life Day is a national effort created by community organization SOAR WV. In Mississippi, an estimated 30 volunteers across 10 counties intended to distribute at least 500 kits. 
Jason McCarty is the other county organizer for Hinds County, as well as a state co-coordinator with Denson. McCarty is the program development strategist for United Way of the Capital Area and for years has been advocating for those impacted by the opioid crisis. He said he sees naloxone as a tool for saving lives and helping people recover from addiction.
“We cannot get people into treatment and into a recovery life if they are dead,” he said.
Distributing naloxone kits is a popular form of harm reduction, a set of strategies and practices aimed at reducing harm to those who abuse drugs. It does not treat drug addiction as a moral failing and seeks to reduce stigma, increase education, save lives and support communities. 
Naloxone, or narcan, temporarily reverses an opioid overdose. The drug wears off after 30 to 90 minutes, so someone who receives a dose needs to be monitored and get immediate medical attention. It is harmless to people who aren’t on opioids. 
The Mississippi State Department of Health’s website has more information on how to help someone who is overdosing and how to order naloxone. 
In 2024, 68% of all suspected overdose deaths in Mississippi were opioid-related. That was down from about 77% in 2023. More than  4,600 non-fatal overdoses have occurred in Mississippi in the first six months of 2025, according to the state health department. 
Emergency medical service members across Mississippi administered naloxone 2,655 times in 2024. In Hinds County, it was 257, one of the highest numbers in the state. Rankin County had 113.
At Tuesday’s Jackson City Council meeting, Mayor John Horhn declared Thursday as Save a Life Day in the city. The council also voted to enter an agreement between the city and United Way of the Capital Area to place and maintain a “Leave Behind” narcan box inside the Warren Hood Building near City Hall. It won’t be paid for with the city’s opioid settlement money.
This proclamation came a day after Horhn said Jackson planned to use future opioid settlement funds for violence prevention. He said it was possible some of the money could go toward preventing drug deaths. 
A Mississippi Today investigation found that Jackson spent $117,734 of the $546,664 it received on moving offices, installing fiber optic cables and a new shelving system.

At the council meeting, McCarty thanked the mayor and council members for their help, but implored the city to spend opioid settlement funds on overdose prevention. He said 10,000 Mississippians have died because of opioids since 1999.
“This opioid settlement money was for them,” he told the council members. “Please, we need to spend this money on opioid prevention, and the United Way of the Capital Area is here to help you do that.”
Horhn did not directly address the settlement funds at that meeting, but did “urge all citizens to participate in activities that support overdose prevention, increase awareness and promote the use of naloxone to save lives.”

Save a Life Day volunteers also faced pushback from those who see distributing naloxone as enabling drug addiction. 
Shell said an employee at Pearl City Hall who handles special event permits was “giving me a hard time.” 
“She disclosed that she was not a fan of the idea or narcan distribution. She questioned where I got the narcan and if it was legitimately from a pharmacy,” Shell said. “She acted as if I was trying to distribute drugs to the community and completely disregarded the fact that it is a harm reduction tool to actually save lives.”
Shell also said that when she called Pearl Police Chief Nick McLendon to ask about permits, he said that while he supported her efforts, the police department would not be partnering with her because he didn’t want the community to think they were supporting illegal drug use. 
McCarty said he requested a meeting with Pearl’s mayor and police chief to do stigma education for the mayor’s staff.
Mississippi Today reached out to McLendon, the employee in question and the Pearl’s mayor’s office. Neither the employee nor the mayor’s office responded in time for publication.
The police chief confirmed his response.
“Our police department has it, our firemen have it. We use it to save lives, but at the same time I’m not going to go publicly encourage illicit drug use,” McLendon said. He said he did not know of any meeting that was requested with him and the mayor.

Denson said that she heard from other volunteers who got pushback from people in authority.
“I know that there have been a few times where we have tried to look for locations, not in Jackson specifically, but … just the feedback from them, saying a representative of their town is saying that they don’t want to draw that image to them,” Denson said.
Shell compared the stigma that comes with addiction to a grey cloud hanging overhead. 
“Whether you’re in recovery or not, people only want to remember what you used to be and not what you’re trying to do today,” Shell said.
Despite the challenges, Denson said she is committed to helping others.
“I don’t fault anybody for not knowing it, but I think there’s a proper time and place for everything, and I’m just honored to be the one to be able to educate somebody or share my experience,” said Denson.
“I don’t want this to sound negative, but I think narcan should be like that change that is left in your cupholder,” she said. “You never know when you need it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25153443/Save-a-Life-Day-2-1.jpg,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

My mom is no stranger to hardship. She raised me as a single mother working long hours, living paycheck to paycheck, while facing the loss of three sons — one to drowning, one to an aneurysm and one to an epileptic seizure. 
She turned her grief into strength and taught me what resilience looks like, even when it feels like the world is against you.
When she had a stroke two years ago, that lesson came full circle. I became her caregiver, her voice pushing her health plan to approve the care she needed. 
Even with good insurance, we had to fight arbitrary prior authorization requirements just to get her into physical therapy. Then every two sessions we had to beg and wait for approval for the next two. 
Recovery doesn’t happen in two-visit increments. It happens when patients have timely, uninterrupted access. That was my inspiration for Assembly Bill 574, which would end insurers’ vague prior authorization requirements and guarantee patients up to 12 physical therapy visits before health plans can delay or deny care. 
Research shows about 90% of patients need at least that many visits to make real progress. But when patients are forced to wait, they don’t just lose time — they lose strength and hope, and they face higher medical costs down the road.Physical therapists are the unsung heroes of recovery. They are there when a stroke survivor takes their first steps, when a new mother struggles through postpartum pain, when someone with Parkinson’s learns new ways to stay independent, and when an athlete fights to get back on the field. 
We cannot let red tape from insurance companies get in their way. Maine and Indiana have already passed similar laws. It’s California’s turn.
Some health plans argue AB 574 will increase costs. They’re wrong. Early, reliable access to physical therapy reduces health care costs by as much as 75% by preventing complications and avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations or reliance on painkillers. 
My mother’s journey taught me how fragile life is, but also how powerful it can be when patients get the right care at the right time. I saw her strength — not just physical, but spiritual — return little by little with every session. Her therapists didn’t just help her move again; they gave her hope that she would once again cook her favorite meals, dance at family gatherings and live with dignity. 
Her story is not unique. Families across California are facing the same fight every day. AB 574, which awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature, can give them a fair shot at recovery, letting families focus on healing instead of hurdles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092525-Physical-Therapy-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473

56,000. 2.7 million. 840,000. Why is one of California’s most pressing policy problems so hard to measure? 


Imagine you’ve finally taken your car to the mechanic to investigate that mysterious warning light that’s been flashing on your dashboard for the past week and a half.
The mechanic informs you that your car’s brake fluid is too low. Dangerously low. Your brake fluid supply, he says, has reached “crisis” levels, which sounds both scary and very expensive. 
Naturally, you would prefer that your car have a non-critical amount of brake fluid. “How much more do I need?” you ask.
“A quart,” the mechanic responds. “No, actually, three quarts. Or maybe seven gallons — but only routed to your rear brakes. Actually, let’s settle on half an ounce.”
Such is the situation with California’s housing shortage.
For nearly a decade now, the Legislature has been churning out bills, Attorney General Rob Bonta has been filing lawsuits and Gov. Gavin Newsom has been revamping agencies, dashing off executive orders and quoting Ezra Klein with the explicit goal of easing the state’s chronic undersupply of places to live.
California simply doesn’t have enough housing and this shortage is the leading cause of our housing affordability concerns — virtually everyone in and around the state government, along with the vast majority of academics who have studied the issue, seems now to agree on this point.
This consensus was on display this year when lawmakers passed two sweeping changes to state housing law, one that shields apartment developments from environmental litigation and the other that would permit denser development near major public transit stops in big cities. Both were legislative non-starters just a few years ago. These days even the opponents of these bills have accepted the premise that the state faces a “housing shortage,” a term evoked at least 30 times in committee hearings and floor speeches this year.
Now, if only anyone could agree on how big the housing shortage actually is. 

Plenty of people have tried to put a number on the problem.
In 2015, the Legislative Analyst’s Office, which serves as a policy analysis shop and think tank for the Legislature, took an early crack at quantifying the state’s shortage by calculating how many additional units major metro areas would have had to build over the prior three decades to keep housing cost inflation on par with that of the rest of the country.  
It came up with 2.7 million missing units.
A year later, consulting giant McKinsey one-upped the LAO, putting the state’s “housing shortfall” at 3.5 million houses, apartments and condos, a number Newsom campaigned on. 
Not all estimates hit seven digits. In 2024, the housing policy nonprofit Up For Growth published the more modest estimated shortfall of 840,000 units, which comes pretty close to the 820,000 Freddie Mac put forward a few years earlier.
California Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing, has counted the deficit at 1.3 million units — but not just any units. That’s how many homes the state needs to add that are affordable to people making under a certain income. 
Then, this summer, a group of housing analysts including an economist at Moody’s Analytics, came up with the strikingly low figure of just 56,000 — though the authors acknowledged that it’s probably an underestimate.
Estimates of the nation’s overall housing supply are similarly all over the place: From as high as 8.2 million to 1.5 million (and, in one controversial paper, zero). 
What even is a housing shortage?
The concept of a “housing shortage” is, in theory, pretty simple, said Anjali Kolachalam, an analyst at Up For Growth. 
“It’s basically just the gap between the housing you have and the housing you need,” she said. 
In practice, defining and then setting out to quantify the “housing you need” is an exercise fraught with messy data, guestimation and an inconvenient need for judgement calls. 
Most estimates begin with a target vacancy rate. In any reasonably well-functioning housing market, the logic goes, some houses and apartments sit empty, either because they’re between renters, they’ve just been built or sold, they’re being fixed or renovated or they’re someone’s second home. A modest vacancy rate is what allows you to pull up Zillow or Craigslist and not get a “No Results Found” error. A very low one suggests there aren’t enough homes to go around.
But choosing a “healthy” vacancy rate — one that reflects a functional housing market — and then backing out the number of additional homes needed to hit it, is more art than science. Most estimates turn to historical data to find some level when supply and demand weren’t completely out of whack. Whether that halcyon period of relative affordability is 2015 or 2006 or 2000 or 1980 varies by researcher and, likely, by the region being considered.
“This notion of ‘pent up demand’ is necessarily in an economist’s judgment call.”Elena Patel, fellow, Brookings Institution
Beyond that, many researchers have tried to put a value on what is sometimes called “pent up” demand or “missing households.” Those are all the people who would have gone off and gotten their own apartment or bought their own place, but, because of the unavailability of affordable places to live, have opted to keep living with housemates, with parents or, in more extreme cases, without shelter of any kind.
Absent a survey of every living person, there’s no way to precisely measure how many people fall into this camp. 
“This notion of ‘pent up demand’ is necessarily in an economist’s judgment call,” said Elena Patel, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped put together a nationwide shortage estimate last year (4.9 million). 
These variations in methods help explain some of the differences in the shortage estimates. Other differences pop-up thanks to the vagaries of data. 
The Moody’s Analytics-led report, for example, calculated a national shortage of roughly 2 million units by adding together both the number of new units needed to raise the overall vacancy rate and the homes needed to backfill their measure of “pent up” demand. But for its California-specific estimate, the data wasn’t available to do the latter, potentially leaving out a big chunk of the statewide shortage. 
Then some estimates differ because the analysts are defining the shortage in a completely different way. 
The California Housing Partnership looks at the difference between the number of households deemed by federal housing guidelines to have “very” or “extremely” low incomes and the number of units that those households could conceivably rent with less than 30% of their incomes. 
That gap of 1.3 million gets at a problem totally distinct from an overall shortage of homes. 
Finally, there’s the question of scale. Housing markets are, on the whole, local. A national shortage is going to add together San Francisco and Detroit, masking the extremes of both. A shortage estimate for a state as large and diverse as California may have the same problem.
“It is like looking for a weather forecast for a trip to the beach and being told that the average temperature nationwide is likely to be 67 degrees,” the authors of the Moody’s-led analysis wrote.
Why estimate a shortage?
What might be more valuable than fixating on any one shortage estimate, said Daniel McCue, a researcher at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, is to look at all the estimates together and appreciate that, by and large, they’re all huge.
“Whether it’s one-and-a-half million or five-and-a-half million, these are big numbers,” he said. That leads to an inescapable takeaway, he said. “There’s so much to do. There’s so far to go.”
Patel, from Brookings, said trying to put a precise tally on what is ultimately the somewhat nebulous concept of a “housing shortage” is still a worthwhile exercise because it gives lawmakers and planners a benchmark against which to measure progress. 
How much additional taxpayer money should a state throw at affordable housing development? How aggressive should a locality be in pursuing changes to local zoning? “The more concrete you can be in policy making land, the better,” she said.
The State of California does in fact have its own set of concrete numbers.
Every eight years, the Department of Housing and Community Development issues planning goals to regions across the state — a number of additional homes, broken down by affordability level, that every municipality should plan for. These are, effectively, California government’s official estimates of the state shortage.
To cobble together these numbers, state regulators look at projections of population growth to accommodate the need for future homes and then tack on adjustments to account for all the homes that weren’t built in prior periods, but perhaps ought to have been. If a region has an excess number of households deemed overcrowded, it gets more units. If vacancy rates are below a predetermined level, it gets more units. If there is a bevy of people spending more than 30% of their incomes on rent, more (affordable) units. 
It’s a process that the state regulators have come to take somewhat more seriously in recent years, engendering an ongoing political backlash from density-averse local governments and neighborhood activists. 
In the state’s last estimate, the topline total was 2.5 million units.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The rate of Louisiana K-12 students missing school without an excuse has remained higher than average since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana. 
Over the past 11 years, the statewide truancy rate has averaged 36%. But since the 2020-21 school year, it has been consistently over 40%, according to the report. 
Louisiana defines truancy as having unexcused absences for five or more school days per semester. 
The state may have a lower chronic absenteeism rate than other states, however, when using the U.S. Department of Education definition. The federal government defines chronic absenteeism as enrolled students who miss 10% of their school days with unexcused absences. 
Chronic absenteeism nationwide is at 23%, but in Louisiana, it stands at just 22.5%, according to data from FutureEd. 
Chronic truancy varies greatly from parish to parish as calculated by the state. The highest rates for 2023-24 were in Tensas (67.5%), Point Coupee (66%), St. Bernard (61.8%) and St. Landry (61.1%). The lowest were Ascension (20.6%), Red River (23.6%), East Carroll (24.1%) and St. James (24.5%). 
High rates of unexcused absences put students more at risk of becoming a school dropout and substance abuse, according to the report.

Hatch United States Courthouse is pictured in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, May 7, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Months after Utah’s ban on flavored vapes, Blackhouse, a former Sugar House vape shop, became a sanctuary and a safe haven for those searching to get flavored cartridges — for spiritual and religious practices. 
The electronic cigarettes joined other sacraments that have been at the center of religious legal challenges in the state like psychedelic mushrooms and cannabis. But, after Utah law enforcement agencies raided the Sugar House location, as well as the Salt City Sanctuary in South Salt Lake in August, all of these sacraments have been put into legal question, with the Sugarleaf Church, the institution overseeing both sanctuaries, initiating a lawsuit to keep them.
“Officers arrived using riot gear, AR-15s, pry bars, and battering rams, forcibly entered both sanctuaries, and immediately began disabling the security systems and surveillance cameras with a crow bar,” the church said in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City in August.

During the raids officers confiscated cannabis and psilocybin products, which the church called “sacramental property,” as well as thousands of flavored vape cartridges, blank checkbooks, waivers, clergy rosters, cash donations, tablets and membership records.
The church is asking a judge to order law enforcement to stop interfering with members’ free exercise of religion and to award compensatory damages. The institution is also asking the South Salt Lake Police Department and the Utah State Bureau of Investigation to undergo mandatory religious sensitivity training and for the immediate return of property.
At Salt City Sanctuary the agents seized “4.24 kilograms of packaged marijuana flower; over a kilogram of ‘fresh flower’ marijuana; 956 1-gram pre-rolled marijuana joints, 8 display jars of marijuana flower, 152.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, mushroom gummies and sample packs, numerous edibles with THC, and rolling papers,” according to a motion to dismiss filed by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office.
With House split on whether to keep ban on flavored vape sales, status quo remains

At Blackhouse, officers confiscated “significant quantities of raw marijuana; psilocybin mushrooms; THC vapes, cookies, gummies, candies, syrups, oils, and similar products; psilocybin cookies, gummies, and similar products; and over 3,000 flavored vape cartridges and order receipts,” the district attorney’s office said in its motion.
Joshua Robers, a church reverend, was also arrested and booked into Salt Lake County Jail during the Salt City Sanctuary raid. He faces multiple charges in 3rd District Court, including possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a third-degree felony. 
The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit this month and declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing. 
The church
The Sugarleaf Church is a non-denominational church with branches in nine states and Mexico that uses psychoactive substances for sacraments, including cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms. Members have to sign an agreement committing to following the church’s code of conduct.
“These are not casual practices,” the church wrote in its lawsuit, “they are intentional, structured, and rooted in decades of education, experience and legal precedent.”
Judge sides with faith group over Utah county in psychedelic mushroom religious freedom lawsuit

The church cited protections under the U.S. Constitution and federal law that guards religious freedom in the filing. It also mentioned a federal judge’s recent decision siding with a small Provo-based faith group that uses psilocybin mushrooms as part of its practice and ordering Utah County to temporarily stop criminal proceedings against the organization and its founder. 
The Provo case partially hinged on a 2024 state law that made it easier to sue government entities if they restrict a person’s right to exercise their religion. 
The Sugarleaf raids came a day after that decision, the church said. According to a sanctuary volunteer’s statement, officers refused to read waivers, doctrinal statements and clergy notices. They also “mocked the religious affiliation.”
“One officer openly referred to the religious operation as a ‘loophole’ and laughed when corrected. He also said ‘look how stupid they are, they wrote it all down,’” the church’s lawsuit says.
However, prosecutors argue the Utah sites are best defined as shops and not churches, since Department of Commerce records indicate that multiple business entities were operating at the same location as Blackhouse Sanctuary, including Blackhouse Vapor Company LLC. That fact, the prosecutors wrote, rebuts the claims that the activities at the Sugar House location were solely religious.
The District Attorney’s Office also pointed out that “plaintiffs assert religious use of marijuana and psilocybin; they do not assert any religious belief or practice relating to flavored vape cartridges.”

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.
But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice. 
The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles — the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s. 
“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”
In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.
The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners. 
Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.
“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”
This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs. 
“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away — whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”
“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime. Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration,” says Chris Brunet, pictured here in front of his house in the Louisiana Isle De Jean Charles resettlement, known as “The New Isle.” Brunet was one of the 37 people or families in the first fully federally-funded relocation project in the country.

And ironically, their new community — dubbed New Isle — could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass. 
What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years. 
Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan — paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill — designed to shore up the coastline.
And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them. 
In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way — and “limited” funds to do so. 
Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10% of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.
In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction — and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds. 
Relocation causes rift
Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.
“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”
It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included. 

https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SIMON_IDJC_droneembed.mp4
The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state. 
Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a “significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders. 
“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn’t really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn’t have a say.”
But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials — despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk — “were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders,  who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts. 
Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s Office of Community Development, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”
McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.
“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”
Louisiana: Leader in severe flood risk
Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years. 
Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration. 
Louisiana’s coast contains 40% of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms. 
For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it. 
The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.
Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area. 
But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”
CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”
Owners report leaking doors, broken appliances
The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities. 
“We knew the money that was awarded wasn’t going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mph winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters,  the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.
One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.
Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned. 
And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs. 
“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”
She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all.  They just washed their hands of us.” 
Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it. 
“You know, that’s a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that’s almost impossible.”
In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-driven relocation touted
University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.
“It’s about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn’t viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people’s options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”
Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise. 
They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.” 
Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline: 

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.
If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.
All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.
All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.
“True management would mean we’re thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We’re going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

‘This conversation is hardly happening’
Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning. 
When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”
“It’s hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It’s even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that’s just as true for government officials.”
Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.  
For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!” 
Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.
There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive? 
“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”
At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started. 
But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office. 
Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response. 
“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they’re going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High insurance costs driving coastal retreat
And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners — yet — the cost of insurance might be.
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out. 
“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what’s coming at us and they’re saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we’re outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now. 
Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can — or should — stay.
“The fact that it’s going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn’t like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything’s back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.” 
Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable. 
“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.” 
“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it’s too late.”

Susie Lee said Thursday. “This is a choice that Republicans are making. They control the House, the Senate, and the presidency.” (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)U.S. Rep. Susie Lee on Thursday said she and her Democratic colleagues are working to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire this year, and if an impasse on the issue results in a federal government shutdown it will be the fault of Republicans.
Lee spoke alongside medical professionals from Southern Hills Hospital in Las Vegas to highlight the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies enacted under the Biden administration. Lee’s comments come days before a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a budget bill that keeps the federal government operating.
“This is not a choice that Democrats are making,” Lee responded when asked if preserving the tax credits is worth shutting the government down. “This is a choice that Republicans are making. They control the House, the Senate, and the presidency.”
She added, “I think that Americans have made it clear that they value their health care and they value having access to health insurance, and I think it’s worth fighting for.”
An estimated 85,000 Nevadans are expected to lose their subsidy, according to Keep Americans Covered, a coalition of health care providers, insurers, and customers.
Nearly 9 out of 10 people who get insurance through Nevada HealthLink, the state’s ACA portal, receive a federal subsidy that lowers the cost of their premiums, according to the organization.Lee argued that Congress needs to act on the issue now because Oct. 1 is when most insurance companies set rates for the upcoming year. Americans will feel the impact of higher premiums and the lack of a tax credit that brings down their premium almost immediately.
Lee said Democrats are scheduled to return to Washington DC on Monday and “stand ready to negotiate.” But she acknowledged that negotiation is only possible when the other party participates.
“The Republicans aren’t going back to Washington on Monday like the Democrats,” she added.
On Thursday, Trump canceled a scheduled meeting with Democratic leaders, leading many to see a shutdown as highly likely. The White House Thursday also sent guidance to departments and agencies, telling them that if a shutdown begins Wednesday, they’re expected to institute mass firings and layoffs. 
Lee said Republicans must “stand up with” Democrats and do what Congress has done since the Constitution was ratified in 1789, assert its Congress’s constitutional authority.
“I have had Republicans in private say to me, ‘We need to reassert our power of the purse,’” said Lee. “I’m standing up. They need to stand up in public too. That’s really what this is going to come down to. At what point are they going to side with the American people over the corruption of this president?”
Lee said she has already introduced a bipartisan bill to address the expiring subsidies. She described it as “a stop gap.”
“What we really want is for these tax credits to be permanent,” she said. “In the big bill, tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans have been made permanent. Let’s make these tax credits permanent as well.”
She continued, “If we can’t get there, my bill just says ‘let’s extend them for one more year and we’ll negotiate in a year.’”
ACA plan premiums are already expected to rise by 17.5% in Nevada next year, something Lee ascribes to “all the other stuff” that was in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Insurers have cited the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits and the impact of tariffs as reasons for the skyrocketing premiums,hike, according to KFF.
The end result is that some families in Nevada could pay upwards of 200% more, according to Keep Americans Covered.
A 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year would see their premium increase by more than $12,000 for the year, while a family of four with an income of $64,000 would see an increase of more than $2,500.
“These are debilitating increases,” Lee said.
Lee, as she has in the past, emphasized that rising premiums for Americans with health insurance secured through the ACA will affect people who secure their insurance through their employer or other means.
“You’re going to see our uninsured population increase probably back to what we were before, which was over 20% in our state,” she said. “As a result of that, they will go to access care at a hospital like Southern Hills at the emergency room. And then, as a result, we all pay. Our insurance premiums will all go up.”
Dr. Mark Glyman, the chief of surgery at Southern Hills Hospital, said the loss of the tax credits will devastate rural hospitals: “They will disappear and that will have a chain reaction on the bigger hospitals.”
Rural patients will have to travel to the bigger hospitals, putting additional pressure on those systems, which are already dealing with issues like worker shortages.
“Even a large hospital like Sunrise, which operates at a loss, will not be able to survive this,” he added.
Defending the ACA
Lee noted that 1 in 10 ACA enrollees are children, and 1 in 4 are between the ages of 50 to 64.
“They don’t qualify for Medicare,” she said of the latter group. “They tend to get higher rates because they’re a little older, a little less healthy.”
Lee recalled a pre-ACA medical crisis that could have bankrupted her own parents. Her mother, shortly before turning 65 and becoming eligible for Medicare, had a major heart attack and spent a month in the hospital.
At the time, their preexisting conditions meant they could not afford insurance. Lee said her mom’s hospital stay resulted in a medical bill “that was basically the value of her home.”
The family was lucky to get onto a payment plan and not lose their home, she said.
Glyman shared a similar personal story, recalling a loved one who, three years ago, spent six months in the hospital with covid. He said her recovery was their family’s top priority, but that in the back of his mind he knew they were at risk of losing everything financially.
The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, keeping the family member alive cost $75,000 per day on top of other hospital costs. She was on it for two months.
Eventually, she made a full recovery.
Real people are behind the premiums, he argued.
“The people we’re taking care of are not strangers,” he said. “They are our parents. They’re our children. They’re our neighbors.”
He added later, “Health care is more than science. It’s humanity. It’s compassion. And it is us. Nobody in Nevada should feel abandoned. Nobody. … Nobody should have to come to the hospital and worry about the fact they’re going to be bankrupt.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SusieLeeSouthernHills-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473
,California,2025-09-26 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom’s climate warrior image is backsliding, environmental groups say",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/gavin-newsom-environmental-image/,Gov. Gavin Newsom said he's the opposite of President Donald Trump when it comes to climate change. But a letter by 40 groups says Newsom is abandoning key environmental policies.,"Gavin Newsom jetted off to New York this week to portray himself as the alternative to Donald Trump on climate policy.
During a speech to the United Nations during Climate Week NYC on Tuesday, Trump declared anew that concerns about climate change are “the greatest con job ever perpetrated in the world,” chiding other nations for efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
That set the stage for Newsom’s appearance at a New York Times-sponsored forum  Wednesday, where he labeled Trump’s assertions “an abomination” and “doubling down on stupid.”
 “You don’t have to believe in science. Believe in your own damn eyes,” Newsom said, while portraying California as a global leader in reducing pollution and shifting to a carbon-free economy.
“There’s no Elon Musk, there’s no Tesla, without California’s regulatory framework,” Newsom said.
His assertions drew pushback from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, who noted California has saddled its consumers with high energy bills.
“If you’re blue-collar, you’re working class, that hurts your quality of life,” said Wright, who spoke at the forum after Newsom.
The exchanges inadvertently framed Newsom’s efforts, as he gears up for a likely White House run in 2028, to maintain the image of a progressive politician, while appealing to voters outside his very blue state.
As Newsom was touting himself as a climate change warrior in New York, back home in California a coalition of more than 40 environmental groups was chastising him in a sharply worded letter for, they said, backsliding on the issue.
“As Governor Newsom touts his climate record on the national and international stage, we must not let him forget that it takes more than words to be a climate leader,” Nicole Ghio, executive director of Food & Water Watch California, said in a statement accompanying the letter. 
“He must stop caving to Big Oil interests and instead act to hold Big Oil accountable and advocate for the safety of our unique and beautiful environment and our vibrant communities. As President Trump slashes environmental protections and walks in lockstep with Big Oil, we need a leader — now more than ever — who will stand up for Californians and our climate.”
The letter listed pro-environment steps Newsom had taken during his administration, then ticked off ways he has recently shifted position, such as legislation to streamline approval of new oil and gas wells.
There’s no question Newsom — who had spent months excoriating refiners for gouging consumers on gasoline prices, even calling a special legislative session to impose new regulations — changed his tune after two refineries announced plans to shut down.
Those closures would sharply curtail supplies of fuel not only for California motorists but for those in Nevada and Arizona, while threatening the ability of airlines and military installations to obtain fuel and probably increasing prices that are already among the nation’s highest.
The environmental coalition letter zeroes in on that aspect of the situation: “Your administration took the unprecedented step of searching for a buyer for the Valero refinery in Benicia, which is slated for closure in 2026, using the resources and reputation of the state government to tip the scales in favor of fossil fuels when market forces make operations unprofitable. Reporting on potential $100M+ bailouts for the refinery are deeply concerning, as that would set an unacceptable precedent for supporting failing industries on public dollars.”
So it goes. The conflict between environmental protection and living costs is just one of many issues that Newsom must manage as he attempts to shift his image from California progressive to mainstream moderate in hopes of grabbing the political brass ring.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425-Gavin-Newsom-Climate-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-26 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"What CT hospitals, health centers want from federal rural grant",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/26/ct-rural-health-transformation-program/,"CT could get at least $500 million over the next five years, starting in 2026. The grant was part of President Trump’s 'big beautiful bill.'","Connecticut officials are hoping the state is allotted a piece of a $50 billion federal grant to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state.
Rural hospitals and health clinics across the U.S. are facing an especially fraught time amid reports of closures, fears of impending Medicaid cuts and financial instability. And they face unique challenges when it comes to access and affordability.
Some of those same barriers exist in the rural pockets of Connecticut, whether it’s around the ability of a patient to physically get to an appointment or more specialized services or workforce shortages around things like primary care.
The Rural Health Transformation Program fund was added in President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” amid growing concerns around Medicaid cuts in the same legislation.
Connecticut state agencies are sourcing ideas that range from workforce development, IT infrastructure, innovation and access to care that are even more burdensome for rural regions compared to their more urban counterparts.
Community health centers and hospitals across Connecticut are cautiously optimistic about the federal funding, which is overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That funding stream comes at an uncertain time for many of these clinics and hospitals as they brace for major health care shakeups in the coming years.
“The fact that there is a grant that came out to help support rural health providers is a large step in the right direction as we continue to face these challenges ahead of us, layered on top of a rural geography where we have some additional unique challenges, just by the nature of where we provide services,” said Joanne Borduas, the CEO of the Community Health & Wellness Center of Greater Torrington.
Officials at the Connecticut Department of Social Services and the Office of Policy and Management are taking the lead on the grant application and working with several other state agencies. They’ve been speaking with other health officials about the application, and a public comment period runs until Oct. 3.
But officials didn’t have time to dither. The process opened in mid-September, and applications are due by Nov. 5. Awards will be decided by the end of the year, and states will start to see that funding in early 2026.
Connecticut’s priorities center around “interventions with long-term benefits” for rural residents and “long-term scalability and financial sustainability,” meaning once the federal funding dries up after 2030, the programs should be able to continue. They hope whatever funding approval they get will have longevity and not need to rely on additional resources from either the federal government or the state.
Half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided between the states. If Connecticut’s application is approved, the state would get $500 million over five years. 
The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of CMS and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors “the administrator determines appropriate.” 
Some in Connecticut don’t feel as optimistic about getting anything from that pot of money because the state is less rural than those in the Midwest, but they still hope the creativity of their application helps boost their chances for additional funding beyond the anticipated $500 million.
“We look different than Wyoming, so the solution in the Northeast is going to be different,” Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, said.
The program’s funding would cover only about a third of the expected cuts to federal Medicaid spending in rural communities, according to a KFF analysis. But the purpose of the grant isn’t meant to deal with holes in reimbursement rates for Medicaid.
“A couple of things that the transformation funds are not intended to do is offset voids of reimbursement for services that are already being reimbursed under either federal or commercial payments. But the focus of the application really needs to resolve around some central themes,” said Kyle Kramer, CEO of Day Kimball Health. For Connecticut, he sees priorities like access to care and workforce development.
But much of the funding that Connecticut could receive would come before Medicaid reforms are fully implemented, and it’s unclear how much it would actually cushion the blow of steep cuts. New work requirements and changes to the provider tax, which help states maximize federal Medicaid grants, won’t go into effect until 2028 at the earliest — and possibly a couple of years later.
Overall, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimates that the “big beautiful bill” would lead to a reduction of nearly $1 trillion over the course of a decade in federal Medicaid spending. For those in rural areas, Medicaid spending could drop by $155 billion over that same period.
That’s on top of the additional changes to health insurance and expiring enhanced premium subsidies for those enrolled in commercial plans through the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT.
But the Trump administration believes the new program will ultimately help rural communities improve access to care, even if they have adequate insurance.
“This program’s major focus is to deal with the folks who are most vulnerable in rural America, because for them, having insurance isn’t the big challenge, usually. It’s getting access to care,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said on a call with reporters last week. “You might have perfectly good health insurance if you’re a retired vet, but you can’t get mental health care practitioners where you live.”
Rural hospitals
Rural hospitals are already struggling throughout the country, and Connecticut is no exception.
Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, in the northeast corner of the state, is an independently owned community hospital and has had its share of financial challenges. The state-owned University of Connecticut Health Center is exploring the purchase of three hospitals in the state including Day Kimball.
“Our area is truly rural and geographically distant from other facilities, and that remoteness is compounded by the fact that while there may be some hospitals a little bit north of us that are closer, it’s complicated by the fact that you’ve got a state border which doesn’t necessarily allow all of your population to get there,” said Kramer of Day Kimball.
Medicaid reimbursement rates have been particular stressors for many of them. Kramer said they lose about 40 cents on the dollar to provide care for patients on Medicaid.
Kramer said he’d like to address the issue of scarcity, particularly among primary care physicians, with not as many licensed professionals moving to rural regions.
“Creating mechanisms for getting more primary care into rural regions is an important aspect of health maintenance, largely because the earlier we’re able to get people into seeing a primary care physician, the more likely we are to identify potential for longer term health risk, and we’re able to manage against that so that potentially we avoid disease progression to the point where it becomes hyper-acute,” Kramer said.
And with shortages and recruitment issues similar to those in many other industries, health care officials are thinking about ways they can entice more physicians and medical school graduates to rural facilities for longer stays. Some of those options include programs that would bring those in medical residencies or fellowships into rural areas.
Kramer said many students are going to medical school and other training programs that largely exist in urban areas, making them more likely to stay in the area where they practice.
With cutbacks to Medicaid likely in the near future, hospitals could become overloaded. Rural providers see many government-insured individuals. If some of those patients fall off the rolls, hospitals expect to treat more people who are uninsured as a direct result of the “big beautiful bill,” also known as H.R. 1.
“I think it’s reasonable to say, then, some of the dollars created in H.R. 1 to support health care delivery in rural America and the network of providers that requires should go to hospitals. I think we have the expertise to do it, but we’re also going to be feeling the ultimate effects of the policy,” Kidwell of CT Hospital Association said.

Community health centers
Federally qualified health centers have also gone through their fair share of turmoil in recent months. They were affected by the freeze of federal funds and, even when those were restored, they still faced some temporary delays to be able to draw down their funds and access reimbursements.
These clinics are similarly anticipating what Medicaid cuts will mean for them, especially since 58% of patients across all health centers in the state get their coverage through the government health program.
The Community Health & Wellness Center of Greater Torrington serves about 7,000 patients — about 52% of whom are on Medicaid — at their three locations in Torrington, Winsted and North Canaan. (They also have school-based health centers.)
Borduas, the CEO of those community health centers, participated in a recent call with DSS and other agencies to discuss ideas and input on the federal grant. Most community health center CEOs and the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut were also on the call.
She wants to see improvements in infrastructure, technology and broadband to help with virtual appointments like telehealth and e-consults, which allow specialists to connect virtually with primary care physicians and patients without needing to see them in person.
But to pull off those services, Borduas said, the right infrastructure needs to be in place.
Like the hospitals, the federally qualified health centers want to find other ways for workforce development amid growing fears of primary care provider shortages. Borduas said she floated a few ways to incentivize providing care in rural areas.
“I had mentioned things like tax credits or loan repayments or something that incentivizes them to say, ‘Yes, I want to go to this very far northwest corner, which is beautiful but doesn’t really have a lot to offer,'” Borduas said.
How rural may be defined
The federal program is branded as a rural health grant but is left open to interpretation and doesn’t explicitly define how states should interpret a region as rural. Kimball of the CT Hospital Association said there’s a need for a “whole state approach” given that Connecticut already has a lot of partnerships in health care.
Kramer said that while the area around Day Kimball is unequivocally rural, it doesn’t mean that people in the area aren’t seeking medical attention in more populated areas of Connecticut where there are partnerships.
“Just because we are definitively rural doesn’t mean that somewhere like a New Haven or a Hartford wouldn’t be the beneficiary of some of these funds, because on a tertiary level, they are a lot of the work that it is associated with advanced care for people who live in rural areas, because we don’t have the capability of doing everything within our organization, nor do some of the other true rural hospitals within the state,” he said.
It’s still unclear, however, how much those grants can be stretched beyond rural regions.
“Some of that discussion is that it’s very clear that this grant is meant for rural [areas], but is there a way to say we have a larger health partner somewhere in the middle of the state that is maybe more urban but can help put processes in place to help support the rural health centers?” Borduas said. “There’s no quite clear answer on that.”
But long-term viability is at the top of the list for Connecticut officials. They want to ensure that whatever the grant supports can continue beyond the five-year window.
“This is going to take some work to make it sustainable beyond those five years … because it will involve work with our local municipalities,” Borduas said. “We can’t do something sustainable if we don’t have support from other means, especially with the continued concerns about changes that are coming at the federal level.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25184660289863-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 08:56:17.336473

But Conine says he’s concerned about Nevada being paid back by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Conine, a Democrat who is running for Attorney General, said he’s speaking out to “just let Nevada know it’s going to get weird before it gets unweird,” should Congress allow the government to shut down. “We’re doing what we can to understand what’s going on and preparing the state treasury to front these dollars.”
In the past, the state has provided funding to keep programs such as school lunches served during government shutdowns, and “historically, that has gotten cleared up when a continuing resolution gets passed,” Conine said during a phone interview Thursday.
Fronting state money poses “an opportunity cost issue,” Conine says, but allows vital services to continue, based in the past on the federal government’s pledge to reimburse the state. 
“I don’t have a ton of comfort that they’re actually going to make good on the promise. We don’t know that they’re actually going to pay us back. The government has not released guidance on whether or not we will get paid back. If they did make a promise that they were going to pay us back, would they actually do it?”
If the feds don’t settle up, Conine says, “the state will be out tens —maybe more — millions of dollars, depending how long we front for them.”
The state receives, on average, $5 million to $30 million a day from the federal government for programs at risk of shutting down, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides assistance to families for essentials such as rent and childcare. Funding expires Sept. 30. 
Conine says the Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) generally sends information to federal agencies who communicate details to states, such as what employees are deemed essential, who can be furloughed, and how agencies are to handle payments.
This time, the only memo Conine said he’s “seen to date” from OMB suggested the federal government “fire a bunch of people if given the opportunity to do so. Use this shutdown in order to do dramatic reductions in force.” The OMB, he says, wants agencies to fire employees who are not currently funded through a budget, and those with jobs outside the administration’s priorities. 
What that probably means, Conine says, “is you’re going to have a bunch of federal employees laid off. Even when the funding gets restored for some of these programs, there won’t be anyone on the other side to do the work.”
An existing example, he says, are student loan forgiveness programs, which “still exist but the people we need to make those programs work aren’t there anymore.” 
Medicaid and Medicare will not be affected, Conine says, because they are already funded. However, “peripheral” programs, such as substance abuse programs, or services to sign up for Medicaid, could be curtailed.
Gov. Joe Lombardo is aware of Conine’s plans, and has voiced no objections or input on which programs to sustain, the treasurer says.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ZachConine-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

The posts on his social media site showed that Trump’s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August, a reflection of the president’s confidence that taxes will help to reduce the government’s budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing.
While Trump did not provide a legal justification for the tariffs, he appeared to stretch the bounds of his role as commander-in-chief by stating on Truth Social that the taxes on imported kitchen cabinets and sofas were needed “for National Security and other reasons.”
Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the administration launched a Section 232 investigation in April about the impacts on national security from pharmaceutical drug and truck imports. The Commerce Department launched a 232 investigation into timber and lumber in March, though it’s unclear whether the furniture tariffs stem from that.
The tariffs are another dose of uncertainty for the U.S. economy with a solid stock market but a weakening outlook for jobs and elevated inflation. These new taxes on imports could pass through to consumers in the form of higher prices and dampen hiring, a process that economic data suggests is already underway.
[RELATED: Trump tariffs usher in uncertainty for CT businesses]
“We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in a recent news conference, adding that higher costs for goods account for “most” or potentially “all” of the increase in inflation levels this year.
The president has pressured Powell to resign, arguing that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates more aggressively because inflation is no longer a concern. Fed officials have stayed cautious on rate cuts because of the uncertainty created by tariffs.
Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either “breaking ground” or being “under construction.” It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S.
In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.
The pharmaceutical drug announcement was shocking as Trump has previously suggested that tariffs would be phased in over time so that companies had time to build factories and relocate production. On CNBC in August, Trump said he would start by charging a “small tariff” on pharmaceuticals and raise the rate over a year or more to 150% and even 250%.
According to the White House, the threat of tariffs earlier this year contributed to many major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, among others, to announce investments in U.S. production.
Pascal Chan, vice president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans’ health with “immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines.”
The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors on Thursday said there were signs of price pressures easing as sales listings increased 11.7% in August from a year ago, but the median price for an existing home was $422,600.
Trump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers that need to be defended.
“Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,” Trump posted.
Trump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices.
His broader country-by-country tariffs relied on declaring an economic emergency based on a 1977 law, a drastic tax hike that two federal courts said exceeded Trump’s authority as president. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case in November.
The president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.
Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.
“There’s no inflation,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “We’re having unbelievable success.”
Still, Trump also acknowledged that his tariffs against China had hurt American farmers, who lost out on sales of soybeans. The president separately promised on Thursday to divert tariff revenues to the farmers hurt by the conflict, just as he did during his first term in 2018 and 2019 when his tariffs led to retaliation against the agricultural sector.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trucks.jpg,,,2025-09-26 09:56:21.711727

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)New Jersey should tighten Medicaid income thresholds, shift more senior care out of nursing homes, and move to boost its nursing workforce to maintain the program amid steep federal cuts, a new report says.
Thursday’s report by right-leaning think tank Garden State Initiative found looming federal cuts, rising health care costs, and enrollment that remains expanded following the pandemic threaten state finances despite the gains in health coverage brought by NJ FamilyCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
“New Jersey cannot keep patching Medicaid with temporary fixes. Without reforms, costs will overwhelm the budget and force cuts elsewhere,” said Danielle Zanzalari, an assistant professor of economics at Seton Hall University and the report’s author.
New Jersey expects to spend nearly $25.5 billion on Medicaid in the current July-to-June fiscal year, including $6.3 billion in state funds, $15 billion in federal funds, and $4.1 billion from drug manufacturer rebates, health insurance assessments, and other miscellaneous sources.
But changes to the federal insurance program made by Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce that funding by $990 billion over 10 years, establish work requirements for certain subscribers beginning in January 2027, and limit NJ FamilyCare coverage for children.
Officials at the Department of Community Affairs, which manages the state’s Medicaid program, have said New Jersey could lose $3.3 billion in annual Medicaid dollars. The reductions could take 350,000 residents — about 18% of all FamilyCare subscribers — off insurance rolls.
Lawmakers have repeatedly said the state lacks the ability to backfill the federal cuts.
The Garden State Initiative report says New Jersey should regularly audit its membership to ensure eligibility — Medicaid eligibility reviews were paused during the pandemic and resumed in April 2023 — and consider lowering the income limit for children under the age of 19.
To be eligible to enroll in NJ FamilyCare, a household must make no more than 138% of the federal poverty level. That’s $21,600 annually for a single person and $44,376 for a four-person household.
Individuals aged 18 and under are eligible as long as their household income is no more than 355% of the federal poverty level, or $110,760 annually for a family of four.
“New Jersey should assess whether current eligibility thresholds remain fiscally sustainable and adjust them to balance access with budget realities,” the report says.
It adds that New Jersey should consider barring pharmacy benefit managers — an insurance middleman that negotiates drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of insurers — from owning pharmacies. Health care affordability advocates have regularly pointed to pharmacy benefit managers as a cause of rising prescription drug prices.
New Jersey should weigh joining a multi-state drug purchasing pool to boost its negotiating power and reduce Medicaid-related pharmacy costs, though that purchasing pool should have allowances for new drugs, the report says.
And the state should establish a separate reserve fund for Medicaid to guard against future funding cuts or enrollment surges that, absent reserves, could imperil plan coverage, according to the report.
Deemphasizing nursing homes in favor of assisted living facilities and home care could also save the state money, the report found.
Average monthly costs for nursing homes in New Jersey in 2022 ($11,253) were 344% higher than they were for home care ($2,534) and 73% higher than assisted living ($6,495), according to a 2023 AARP survey. Nursing home services often include costs not covered by assisted living facilities or home care.
“Without long-term care reform and workforce investment, the system will remain financially strained and structurally unsustainable,” the report says.
The state should also look to boost its nursing workforce following pandemic departures and amid projections from the New Jersey Collaborative Center for Nursing that warn the state will lack 24,450 nurses by 2036.
The state should boost scholarships, certification programs, and technical education for nurses to expand access to the profession; recruit nurses from other states or nations; and create pathways that afford aides and lower-practice nurses advancement opportunities to higher practices.
“The solutions are not complicated: contain costs by addressing eligibility and holding (managed care plans) accountable, shift care toward in-home and community-based services, and invest in the nurse workforce,” Zanzalari said.
Lawmakers have weighed legislation that would allow nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals to practice in New Jersey for up to a year while awaiting decisions on their New Jersey licensure applications. An earlier version of that bill won unanimous Assembly approval last March, but its amended version has yet to see floor votes in either chamber.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Academic outcomes for Minnesota students have stagnated since the pandemic in both reading and math, with 2025 state assessments showing little change since tests of students in grades 3-8 resumed in 2022.
A Reformer analysis of test scores from 2019 to 2025 found that less than one out of every seven Minnesota school districts have returned to pre-pandemic proficiency rates in either subject since students were pushed into online learning in March 2020. The districts that did recover fully serve only 5% of students in the state and are mostly smaller districts.
Among the 120 districts with at least 1,000 students, just five districts have returned to or surpassed their 2019 proficiency rates in 2025 in either subject.
Nationally, every state is showing worse academic outcomes than in 2019, according to the Education Recovery Scorecard. But unlike Minnesota, some states have started to show students on an upward trajectory.
Using data from national and state assessments in 2024, the scorecard ranked Minnesota students’ pandemic recovery 45th in math and 38th in reading. The report estimated Minnesota students remained about three-quarters of a year behind in math and half a year behind in reading compared to where students were before the pandemic. In other words, a Minnesota fourth grader knew as much as in 2019 as a child halfway through fifth grade in 2025. Similarly, students are still half a year behind in both reading and math nationwide, according to the report.
Some of the top states for academic recovery include Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi, none of which typically make lists of the best states for public education.




Eastern Carver County School District is one of the few large Minnesota districts where test scores have increased in math. In 2019, 54% of the district’s students were meeting or exceeding state standards in math, which dropped to 51% in 2022. Scores have rebounded and now 56% of students are testing as proficient in math.
Superintendent Erin Rathke and Assistant Superintendent Nate Manaen said that the district’s culture around continuous school improvement — analyzing student data and changing instructional practices to improve student outcomes — is strong.
“It’s important for us to give credit to our teachers. We have excellent teachers that are buying into the curriculum, are looking at data, and making adjustments for our students,” Rathke said in an interview with the Reformer.
The district also focused on accelerating students’ learning after the pandemic, rather than lowering standards.
“Eastern Carver County was really intentional about saying we are not going to water down what learning looks like. And instead, really be intentional about accelerating students as they come back,” Manaen said.
According to Manaen, teachers, principals and district leadership were all focused on making sure that math classes were both rigorous and engaging for students when they returned to in-person learning.
At the middle school level, that meant implementing an instructional model called “building thinking classrooms” that is a form of what’s known as inquiry-based instruction. This entails students engaged in more discussion in math class, solving problems in groups and discussing their strategies. Manaen and Rathke say keeping students engaged in the classroom has been a key to the district’s improvements.

Pillager School District, a small, rural district near Brainerd, was one of the few school districts that saw higher proficiency in both math and reading in 2025 compared to 2019. Ryan Krominga, the director of curriculum and instruction, credits the improvement in part to the district’s manageable size.
Whereas large districts had to coordinate more transportation, food and other logistics during the pandemic, smaller districts “have fewer people to get on the phone with and start to shift things around,” Krominga said. As a result, Pillager was able to return to the classroom on the earlier side, with some in-person instruction starting in the fall of 2020.
In-person instruction is far more effective, especially for the youngest learners, than online.
Another factor was the district’s strategic use of COVID-19 federal assistance money. To support pandemic recovery, the federal government gave K-12 schools $190 billion in financial assistance. Minnesota schools received about $2.6 billion.
States had wide latitude in how to guide districts to use the funds. While some states took a narrow approach, limiting districts to a few strategies, Minnesota took a kitchen sink approach, allowing districts to spend on 18 different strategies.
Some districts, like Minneapolis Public Schools, allocated a majority of their federal funds to giving educators bonuses and raises, and closing their pre-existing structural budget deficit while building up financial reserves, which were also allowed uses.
Early evidence from California shows districts that spent more on academic support have had greater academic recovery.
Pillager School District used part of its federal cash on hotspot technology to keep its students connected in a rural area with spottier internet access. Krominga said that teacher-student connectivity was a priority when thinking of ways to use the funds.
Pillager allocated another portion of the federal funds, which have since run out, to expanding summer school services to all students — three weeks of targeted learning in the morning and summer camp activities in the afternoon, transportation included.

In Minnesota, expanded summer school programs were used to serve about 6% of students, per 2023 data. In contrast, nearly 7% of students in Louisiana received tutoring and 11% of students had access to expanded summer school programs because of federal pandemic aid.
Krominga, who has a 12-year-old son, said he’s hopeful about the future of Minnesota’s education despite a pandemic dip across the state, in part due to revised math standards in 2022 and the 2023 READ Act, which overhauled literacy instruction.
“The training that we’re doing for teachers is having an impact,” Krominga said. “We’re probably a couple years out before we start to see state tests changing.”







Data
All data comes from the Minnesota Department of Education Data Center. We used All-Standards Based Public MCA/MTAS Results files to look at MCA proficiency rates for both math and reading. MCA/MTAS proficiency rates use the population of test-takers as the denominator, whereas North Star proficiency rates use the total population of students, including students in tested grades who did not participate in testing. We chose to use MCA/MTAS proficiency rates to avoid artificially deflating the proficiency rates for schools with low test participation.
Data for total enrollment and percent of students who would be eligible for Free and Reduced-Price lunch under federal guidelines comes from the MDE Students file. Students are eligible for Free and Reduced-Price lunch under federal guidelines if they live in a household below 185% of the federal poverty line, and the corresponding column in our data table is labeled as such. The joined data set (enrollment data and MCA/MTAS data for 2019, 2022 and 2025) can be found here.
As a note, we present the proficiency rates for those three years to illustrate the trends of school districts, not specific student cohorts. The student cohorts for the three years we included (2019, 2022 and 2025) differ, and we did not adjust for changes in student demographics for this analysis. Results for smaller districts are more sensitive to small changes in student performance compared to larger districts, and it’s best to compare results across similar-sized districts.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250919_1294-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

(Photo by Caspar Benson/Getty Images)Indiana lawmakers heard stark warnings Thursday that the state’s prison population is again nearing capacity while funding for local alternatives is shrinking.
Margaux Auxier, with the Indiana Department of Correction, on Thursday told the state’s Interim Study Committee on Corrections that the agency’s incarcerated population dipped during the pandemic but is now back on the rise. 
“We saw during COVID-19 that our numbers drastically dropped … our population did dip quite a bit during that time period,” she told the panel, which is made up of lawmakers, prosecutors, public defenders and other corrections-related officials. 
She said DOC recorded 22,000 inmates at its low but that the state now has more than 25,000 individuals in custody, with facilities operating at more than 95% capacity.
Auxier told lawmakers that Indiana’s facilities are once again filling up. 
“Now, we’re seeing an increase in our population overall,” she said. “To try to mitigate some of these issues, we have implemented a policy to allow more minimum security placements. We actually will eventually go onto a waitlist. So we’re trying to get those folks that are low-risk individuals into a facility that would help them transition better back into the community.”
Prison numbers rising
She noted that “an influx” of Level 6 offenders “are coming back to us to serve their time in DOC instead of at the county level.”
Auxier also pointed to sentencing changes as a factor behind the rise. 
“If you think about it, just from a numbers perspective, 75% is more than 50% so they’re serving a longer period of incarceration,” she said, referring to changes in Indiana’s sentencing laws that increased the portion of a sentence that offenders must serve — from 50%, or day-for-day credit, to 75%, or three-for-one credit.

That change means offenders now serve a longer period of their sentence in prison, which Auxier said contributes to a higher prison population over time.
“Those individuals kind of stack up over time,” she continued. “That’s what we’re seeing as a stacking effect.”
Chris Daniels of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council additionally highlighted a decade-long shift in criminal filings. 
“We’ve seen a pretty dramatic increase in the most violent crimes, in our most serious levels, in terms of our murders and our level one and two felonies,” Daniels said. 
“Our threes, fours and fives, they’ve stayed about the same,” he added, referring to felony offenders. “And then we see a decrease in some of our level sixes and a fairly significant drop in our misdemeanor charges.”
There are six felony levels with level one being the highest.
According to prosecutor data, Indiana courts handled 316 murder filings in 2015 compared to a projected 572 this year. Filings for the lowest-level offenses have moved in the opposite direction, with misdemeanors falling from more than 220,000 in 2015 to under 190,000 projected for 2025.

Daniels said the complexity of those top-tier cases — murders, rapes and major drug-dealing prosecutions — has forced prosecutors to shift resources away from low-level filings. 
“These are complex drug dealing cases, rape cases, terrible child molest cases, the types of stuff that we really want prosecutors’ offices focusing on,” Daniels said.
But Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council further noted that despite spikes in violent incidents, overall crime trends have been relatively flat or down.
“On average, crime is declining or holding steady, but there are spikes in certain places,” he said. He warned that “suicide, alcohol, drug-related deaths far outnumber homicides,” and that jails and prisons too often serve as “the providers of last resort” for behavioral health.
Funding shortfalls
Shifting gears, Scott Hall, executive director of Marion County Community Corrections, told the interim committee that probation and community corrections now supervise more than 106,000 Hoosiers daily. But state grant funding — the primary support for such programs — has been flat for seven years and was cut by $7 million statewide this year, with more reductions expected in 2026.
“We are community supervision,” Hall said. “We are more cost effective than having someone in a jail or prison, and the services that we provide then provide individuals an opportunity to get out of the system and hopefully avoid returning to the system.”
Local impacts of the cuts are already showing up in next year’s grant awards. Monroe County, for example, will lose funding for both its drug court and mental health court, according to DOC records presented to the committee.

In Lake County, community corrections saw its award shrink by nearly $600,000, with reductions hitting its re-entry and veterans courts.
Smaller counties face similar challenges. Boone County lost support for jail treatment programming, while Dubois County’s request for expanded community supervision was pared back.
Hall cautioned that the timing could not be worse.
“The need has never been greater,” he said. “Cutting these programs now will only push more people into already overcrowded jails and prisons.”
Still, Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, raised questions about the program’s financial accountability. He pressed Hall for specifics on how much of the program’s budget comes from state grants, county contributions and user fees. Freeman was especially concerned about the lack of data on how many participants are declared indigent and therefore do not pay for services.
“Only government can be so special as to tell me, ‘We have a funding problem. We have no idea how many people don’t pay for a service that they’re actually using, but I need more money from the state,’” Freeman said.
The senator acknowledged the challenges that come with collecting fees from participants, however, especially once debts are sent to collections.
“I mean, look, there is a finite amount of money. In my time in the General Assembly, the amount of money that the taxpayers give to government has almost doubled,” Freeman said. “I don’t know if that’s right or wrong. I’m just telling you it’s almost doubled.”
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, pressed lawmakers to confront the root causes of crime rather than only funding prisons. 
“Most of the people we’re encountering in these programs, they either have substance use disorders or mental health issues or most of the time, both,” Pierce said. “Unless we start funding these programs to get at the underlying cause of crime, we’re going to continue to have our constituents frustrated. Why does this person keep coming back all the time? Why didn’t you just lock them up forever?”

(Getty Images)It’s one thing to read about a 10% cut in government spending and it’s quite another to delve into spending plans that agencies are filing to meet that mandate. Over and over, it’s clear that state employees are on the front line, shouldering the burden.
If I had to cut 10% from my household budget, I’d have places to look: cutting media subscriptions or streaming and cable services, eating out less, moving to a cheaper phone plan, skipping an annual vacation. You get the point.
But for many agencies, most of their spending — sometimes, more than 90% — is on the employees performing the services for constituents.
So, agencies are laying off employees, not filling jobs and ultimately piling more on staffers that stay. They have to do their own work and the duties of former coworkers.
Two agencies filing plans to meet spending reductions note that positions leaders deem “critical” can be filled — “but first must be vacant for at least 30 calendar days before being posted” to “ensure at least 60-90+ days of cost savings.”
Indiana agencies cut staff, contracts as mandatory spending plans roll in

Some are trying to make up for it. The Commission for Higher Education, reported redistributing responsibilities to remaining personnel, along with a collective $70,000 in raises, “to recognize the additional workload.” But the spending plans that have been approved contain few similar examples.
There’s no exact count of layoffs, as news trickles out agency by agency. But the overall loss is coming up in the state’s headcount.
Last December, Indiana peaked at 32,218 state employees. Four agencies — Department of Correction, Family and Social Services Administration, Department of Child Services and Department of Transportation — account for about half of that total.
As of Wednesday, that number has dropped to 30,616. That’s a 5% drop, in less than a year, under Gov. Mike Braun.
I can’t tell you how many employees have reached out in concern. They love their jobs and want to help Hoosiers. But they are frustrated.
First, thousands were forced to come back to the office after hybrid work agreements were rescinded. That has led to irritation – especially those who see Braun spending time at his personal residence in Jasper and getting state-paid helicopter flights back and forth.
Employees, meanwhile, are fighting for spots in crowded parking garages or switching their hours to before dawn to avoid traffic.
How else are agencies cutting spending?
They are also canceling contracts, not replacing vehicles and looking for legal changes, like relaxed mailing requirements.

And at the same time, some of the agencies have additional duties – such as the Indiana Department of Revenue. Lawmakers added a tax amnesty program in the state budget but didn’t provide resources to make it happen.
Some agencies are receiving exemptions from the cuts. For instance, the Indiana Department of Health successfully requested an exemption to fund the licensing and surveying of health care facilities, according to the spending plan. This is a safety measure that should not be compromised.
And when leaders want a program, they prioritize it.
That will likely happen later this year, as a special session to redistrict congressional boundaries seems inevitable. That could cost a few hundred thousand dollars, depending on how long it lasts. And the Indiana Department of Correction keeps buying expensive execution drugs — up to $300,000 per dose – with some of it expiring unused.
Of course, it’s good to maximize efficiency and make sure state government hasn’t grown too much. But the way to do that is to eliminate unnecessary programs and duties. The problem with today’s effort is that duties are continually added and never taken away. And that leaves fewer state employees to handle the load.

Newly revised numbers show that Michigan actually lost 13,800 jobs in the 12 months ending in March, instead of the 25,900 jobs reportedly created in the period.
“It was an ouch,” said Gabe Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics.
The preliminary benchmark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows there were 911,000 fewer U.S. jobs created in the 12 months ending in March than reported in the closely watched monthly figures. It was the largest preliminary revision by the bureau in records going back to 2000 and cut U.S. job growth in the period in half.
Michigan had 39,700 jobs wiped out in the revision, the third most in the country behind North Carolina (56,900) and Colorado (51,200). Most of those lost jobs — 31,300 — came out of metro Detroit.
But the revision added 26,800 jobs to metro Grand Rapids. That was the highest-percentage jobs jump among metro areas with populations of one million or more.
The revision covered the last nine months of President Joseph Biden’s administration and most of the first three months of President Donald Trump’s administration. It didn’t provide monthly overestimates.
Ehrlich, who has been forecasting Michigan’s economy for years, cautioned that the final benchmark revision could reveal a smaller loss when it’s tabulated early next year, as has happened in the past.
And monthly BLS data show that Michigan has added 21,300 payroll jobs since March.
The conflicting numbers illustrate how difficult it is to understand what’s happening in a state economy being roiled by Trump’s chaotic tariff and trade policies and the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

In its latest Michigan economic forecast this month, Ehrlich and his U-M colleagues took the unusual step of not estimating state government revenues for the next two years because of the unknown impact of the new federal tax-and-spending law.
“We believe there are important open questions about how these changes will interact with state revenue collections, and that these changes likely represent the largest updates to our outlook for state revenues since May,” the forecast said. “We expect to issue an updated full report and analysis with our November forecast.”
Their September outlook shows continued payroll job growth over the next two years, although at a much slower pace than the past several years. The state is expected to add 13,700 jobs next year and 12,100 in 2027, down from 38,700 this year.
But Ehrlich said he’s concerned about the state’s shrinking labor force. Employers added 5,000 jobs in August, according to the monthly report from the state Department of Technology, Management and Budget released earlier this month.
But the same report showed that 7,000 fewer people were employed than in July and that 14,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. August’s state jobless rate fell slightly from 5.3% in July to 5.2% in August, mostly because of workers holding or seeking jobs.
“All I can say is that this month’s report is a real head-scratcher,” Ehrlich told me, adding that people shouldn’t “over-interpret” one month’s data.
But the labor force has been shrinking for five straight months and is down by 38,000 working-age adults since March.
And jobs are getting harder to find in Michigan. There were 1.44 unemployed people in the state for every available job in June, the highest level in five years.

A major part of the data confusion is the yawning gap between reported payroll jobs created by businesses and a separate household survey that determines the unemployment rate.
That’s not unusual in an uncertain, declining economy. Economists generally put more stock in the payroll numbers reported by businesses. But Ehrlich said this time what working people are reporting in government surveys might paint a more accurate picture of the job market.
“What we see right now is that the household survey may be mostly right,” Ehrlich said. “It’s tough to know.”
And it’s getting tougher, thanks to the Trump administration’s assault on the BLS, which collects a variety of crucial jobs and economic data.
In August, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weak jobs report. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the BLS rigged the jobs numbers to make him look bad.
(Just wondering: if McEntarfer, a Biden appointee, was cooking the books to hurt Trump, why would she have approved the big jobs revision that diminishes Biden’s record?)
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has kept up the attack, saying the jobs numbers won’t be accurate until key people hired in Democratic administrations are purged from the agency.
Ehrlich said he still has confidence in the BLS, which he called “an unappreciated gem,” but he and other economists say data collection can be improved.
Part of the problem is that initial response rates from businesses and households have been declining since Covid, leading to big revisions as more data is collected.
“The BLS is doing the best job it can,” Ehrlich told me. “It’s a challenging job and there’s always room to improve. The resources have not been there to do that.”
It’s easier for Trump to blame the data rather than his own destructive policies, which are killing jobs, raising prices, stalling business investment and souring consumers.

Older adults, their families and caregivers can complete a survey online or participate in a virtual public listening session to share suggestions. 
“The community’s input is critical as we develop the next four years of services for Mississippi’s older adults,” KenYada Blake-Washington, director of the MDHS Division of Aging & Adult Services, said in a press release. “We want to hear from the community about what matters most to them and their families.”
The State Plan on Aging is the “blueprint” for the division, which provides services to people 60 and older, Blake-Washington told Mississippi Today. The agency crafts a new plan every four years. 
The plan aims to improve services for older Mississippians and identify barriers that prevent them from accessing those services.
“It’s a call to action, improvement, resource alignment and allocation,” Blake-Washington said. 
The Aging and Adult Services division works with 10 area agencies on aging on a range of services, including nutrition and meal programs, transportation, case management, legal assistance and caregiver support.
The state plan will fuse input from the area agencies on aging, federal requirements, state-level goals and input from Mississippians. 
The state’s population is swiftly aging. Between 2010 and 2020, Mississippi saw a 34% increase in people 65 and older. 
Older adults, their families and caregivers can complete an online survey to provide  suggestions. The survey’s deadline is Oct. 30. 
The Division of Aging and Adult Services will hold three virtual public listening sessions for input. The first two are next week: 4-5:30 p.m. Monday and 9-10:30 a.m. Wednesday. The third session is 10-11:30 a.m. Oct. 14.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06185626/MDHS-Resource-and-Referral-Center8.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

Dave Upthegrove wants a $60 million boost for wildfire prevention funding that was shortchanged in the last legislative session. Plus, he is seeking $44.8 million more for wildfire fighting for the 2026 fiscal year, which runs through next June. 
In a letter to Office of Financial Management Director K.D. Chapman-See, making the request, Upthegrove acknowledged the “difficult choices” budget-writers will face in 2026. 
State revenue is falling short of expectations despite significant tax increases this year, and many state agencies are absorbing cuts lawmakers made to balance the current budget.
“With this reality in mind, our budget proposals are carefully crafted, targeted, and respectful of the fiscal challenges before the governor and Legislature,” Upthegrove wrote.

In 2021, state lawmakers approved House Bill 1168, which committed $500 million over eight years to the state Department of Natural Resources for wildfire preparedness and response. 
State spending largely kept up with that target until this year. The department received $115 million in the last two-year budget and $130 million in the one before that. But in the current budget, lawmakers provided just $60 million. 
The Department of Natural Resources was prepared for this year’s fire season and has money in the account left over from past years for some additional fire prevention work, which can include activities like tree thinning and prescribed burns. 
But the department says that reduced funding limits the amount of work it can do to prepare for upcoming fire seasons. 
“Without these funds, Washington could see an increased number of fires that are going to be larger and cost the taxpayers more money,” Upthegrove said in his budget request.
Agencies filed requests this month with the Office of Financial Management for the 2026 supplemental budget lawmakers will write next year. Gov. Bob Ferguson will release his spending plan in December, which will serve as a starting point for discussions.
The supplemental budget will make adjustments to the two-year plan approved this year. 
Wildfires are continuing to increase in severity and frequency in Washington, with forecasts showing that Natural Resources will need a minimum of $44.8 million more than the Legislature allotted for fire suppression in 2026. 
The request is based on a forecasting model that analyzes the last 10 years of firefighting costs. 
But with wildland fire season now lasting longer than it has in the last 10 years and stretching well into the fall, the department plans to recalculate its cost projections in January to account for money spent battling late-season wildfires. 
The current budget approved by the Legislature this year allocates $79.5 million from the general fund for wildfire suppression in 2026, down from over $100 million each year between 2022 and 2025. 
So far this year, wildfire suppression has cost the state about $93 million, not counting funds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to reimburse for the Burdoin fire in the Columbia River Gorge.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9214-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 07:57:45.401691

Thursday on the gubernatorial campaign trail proved otherwise.,"Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill will face off in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy in 2025. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)NEW BRUNSWICK — In a crowded room on the Rutgers campus on Thursday, two state senators tried to impart the wisdom of political civility to students at the very moment our state’s gubernatorial race was devolving into the campaign’s ugliest day yet.
Sen. Jon Bramnick, a Republican, and Sen. Joe Cryan, a Democrat, are on what they’re calling a college civility tour, one they announced after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed on Sept. 10. I have my doubts about whether two lawmakers from New Jersey can help drag American politics out of the sewer, so I visited Rutgers to see if Bramnick and Cryan would dispel my doubts.
Momentarily, they did. Bramnick spoke somberly about the strife and violence of the 1960s and how he fears those days are returning, and Cryan was sincere when he urged the students to remember that we don’t all live life’s experiences the same way.
“Always keep in mind that somebody else’s perspective isn’t ours, and as a result of that, let’s listen, learn, and be a part of the great shared experience called this American experiment,” he said.
Well said! Unfortunately, outside the walls of that room on Rutgers’ campus, the race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy was deteriorating into acrimony, raising doubts about Bramnick’s and Cryan’s premise that we can all just get along.
The ugliness stems from two stories that dropped Thursday, one from the New Jersey Globe that says Democrat Mikie Sherrill did not walk with her graduating class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1994 as punishment related to a massive cheating scandal that implicated more than 100 of her classmates, and a CBS News report that the National Archives released an unredacted copy of Sherrill’s military records to an ally of her GOP opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, records the Ciattarelli campaign then distributed to reporters without shielding personal information related to her and her family.
Republicans used the Globe story to accuse Sherrill of “cheating her way” through the Naval Academy, and are calling on her to release her disciplinary records to confirm her claim that she was merely punished for not turning in students who did cheat. And Sherrill said the CBS story proves the Trump administration and Ciattarelli are “breaking the law and exposing private records for political gain.”
The problem for Sherrill: The Globe story calls into question the very thing she has centered her campaign on, her military record. Contemporaneous reports about the cheating scandal — an unknown number of students obtained a copy of an electrical engineering exam days before the test was given — indicate the Navy believed 15% of Sherrill’s graduating class were implicated, and a special naval tribunal found dozens guilty of honor violations and issued them punishments like loss of privileges, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Sherrill’s claim that she didn’t walk in her graduation ceremony as punishment for not turning in fellow students who cheated is a plausible story. She could confirm it by letting us take a peek at those disciplinary records, but her campaign has nixed that idea.
What should have been a victory lap for the Ciattarelli campaign, though, was marred by the CBS story, which implicates the campaign in distributing documents that included Sherrill’s Social Security number, personal information about her parents, life insurance details … incredibly personal stuff handed out to reporters and God knows who else. The campaign has pinned the blame on the National Archives, which appears to be 100% responsible for releasing the unredacted records in the first place, but had no role in giving them to members of the media.
Both stories dropped the same day a new poll said the governor’s race is all tied up, with Ciattarelli and Sherrill both at 43% and a whopping 11% of voters undecided. If this race is indeed a dead heat, things are only going to get uglier from here.
Meanwhile, David Weigel of Semafor reported Thursday that conservative super PAC American Principles Project is going to flood our airwaves with an ad to scare voters about transgender people. Really nasty stuff.
Back on the Rutgers campus, I asked Bramnick what he thought of the civility of the current gubernatorial campaign.
“Not bad, actually. I watched the debate — I didn’t really hear any personal insults. I think it’s shockingly good from that standpoint,” he said.
He’s right that Sunday’s debate was no brawl. But I think the days of this race being civil are over. Buckle up.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As Indiana’s maternal and infant mortality rates tick down, the work isn’t done for health care advocates seeking to improve the state’s outcomes. 
Over a dozen people spoke to the state’s Interim Study Committee on Public Health, Behavioral Health and Human Services Thursday, speaking about the need to improve access to mental health services for new mothers and ways to reduce mortality rates.
“I think this shows how we have to wrap our arms around these moms and these families. In some instances, it’s an exhausted mom who works the night shift,” said State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver. “But it’s also educating babysitters and grandmas, etc. on safe sleep practices. 
“It really does come down to education. Unfortunately, there’s no one silver bullet.”
Hoosiers have long had one of the worst mortality rates in the wealthy world for all new mothers, but especially for Black moms. Similar racial disparities exist for newborn children. 
The state has made strides when it comes to infant health  — reporting the lowest mortality rate since the state started gathering data 100 hundred years ago. Deaths for mothers remain above pre-COVID levels as of 2022, though there’s a data lag so members of the Indiana Maternal Mortality Review Committee can assess every single death.
 
The National Maternal Mental Health Hotline is free, confidential and available 24/7. Call or text at 1-833-TLC-MAMA or 1-833-852-6262.


“National data from the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) shows that nearly 80% of (maternal) mortalities are considered preventable, so we are seeing many states focus on this postpartum period to reduce overall mortalities and improve maternal health,” said Kendall Speer, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Speer highlighted several efforts in other states that could be introduced in Indiana, such as removing prior authorization requirements for certain antidepressants for mothers, authorizing more providers to give perinatal maternal counseling and requiring hospitals or insurers to distribute information. 
But the state has deeply cut funding for programs with local public health departments that were working to improve infant and maternal health outcomes. Using $225 million under Health First Indiana, counties reported more than 352,000 services to moms and infants — the second-most common use for funding following school-based health programming.
Facing a budget crunch, Republicans chose to cut funding for the program after just two years, disrupting the biggest investment in public health in decades.
Examples of programming from the previous round of funding include collaborating with local milk banks or paying for visiting health providers to check on local moms at home. Another county focused specifically on developing relationships with Amish midwives and prenatal care to prevent preeclampsia.
 Presentation specifics

A big target for health care advocates was emphasizing the importance of perinatal care, or doctor appointments during the earliest stages of pregnancy. The Department of Health reported that two out of every five infants who died received no care in the first semester of pregnancy. 
But getting to the doctor is another compilation in a state with a dwindling number of OBGYN professionals. Though not mentioned during the meeting, states with abortion bans have seen OBGYNs leave their practices for states protecting reproductive health procedures. Additionally, as health care costs soar and some facilities opt to merge, rural hospitals have closed their expensive delivery and maternal care units. 
“We are struggling to recruit and we are struggling to keep the ones we have,” Dr. Julie Tillman, with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told the committee. 
She added that even when the state graduates 20 trained OBGYNs each year, only half stay to practice in the state.
Combined with other factors, pregnant Hoosiers have fewer and fewer resources to access perinatal care, especially those located outside of urban areas. Rep. Cindy Ledbetter, a nurse practitioner in southern Indiana, noted that state efforts to grow her field could help alleviate that gap — though the state also has a nursing shortage.

The state’s oversight of the Medicaid program could also be an opportunity to improve both maternal and infant health. Medicaid covers roughly half of all births in the state and just over half of the infants who died in the last year were born to mothers who were enrolled on Medicaid at the time of their birth. Recently, the state extended Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months, rather than 60 days, to help new mothers get access to health services.
“That fact that they’re on Medicaid — I think we have a responsibility as a state and for the Medicaid department to make this one of our priorities,” said Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis, about infant deaths.
 Mental health and substance use disorder

One of leading causes of death for new mothers in Indiana is substance use, though it’s known as a pregnancy-associated death because pregnancy plays a role but isn’t the sole direct cause. Nationwide, such deaths are categorized with mental health conditions, which are the second-leading cause of death for new moms.
“We know that one-in-five women experience mental health challenges before and after pregnancy — and that might be an underestimate,” said Speer. 
Speer highlighted the state’s Perinatal Quality Collaborative, which includes a practice bundle for providers treating pregnant or postpartum people with substance use disorders. States can also use Medicaid to cover doulas, who are nonmedical providers who can focus on the mental and physical health of the mother throughout the pregnancy and beyond. Such practitioners have shown great promise in improving maternal outcomes.

Albertina Jones, an Indianapolis doula, shared that one young mother called her asking if she should induce her own pregnancy with something she could buy over-the-counter, not knowing about the potential complications.
“We’re just regular people — we’re not medical doctors,” said Jones. “It creates a safe space for young women who are not knowledgeable to come to us … they can tell us just about anything and we can give them the right information.”
Mental health screenings at doctor offices could catch depression and other mental health conditions, especially if parents are also screened by their child’s pediatrician. Forty percent of mothers skip their own postpartum appointments, but could get care during doctor visits for their children. 
Dr. Evan Kreutzer, with the Indiana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, noted the mental health burden on all family members — not just new mothers. He said he’d seen fathers who also dealt with depression following a birth and emphasized the benefit of screening patients as a pediatrician.
“It’s a whole family health issues and, by extension, a child health issue,” said Kreutzer. “In my own practice, I’ve had numerous mothers and fathers quietly circle ‘yes’ on a screening or questionnaire when asked if they had thoughts of harming themselves. 
“Almost without fail, they had never told anyone else. Because we screened, we were able to connect them to care.”
However, he said that providers needed to know where to refer parents for further services. He said he usually screened any adult who brought a newborn child to an appointment.
The committee will meet again on Oct. 15 with a focus on its final report and whether the Department of Education should be required to develop a water safety curriculum for schools.

(Image courtesy FWP)You really can’t make this stuff up.  Last week Montana’s Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks biologists electroshocked the Big Hole River to collect data as part of a trout “adult mortality study” in conjunction with Montana State University.  If the goal was to induce mortality in adult trout, they succeeded — and left a long trail of dead fish in their wake.
The incident was first reported by Craig Jones of Great Divide Outfitters, who was on the 3.8 mile stretch between the Jerry Creek and Greenwood Bottoms fishing access sites.   As reported by the Montana Standard’s Duncan Adams, Jones put it bluntly: “I came in the day after they’d electrofished and there were dead fish everywhere.  It’s just a bummer. It’s just one blow after another (for the river).”
Indeed, the picture Jones posted online shows a very large adult brown trout, half a dozen rainbow trout and a whitefish, just a small part of the more than 70 dead fish they were able to net.  Jones added that some dead fish were too small to net and count and eagles were busy retrieving carcasses, meaning there were far more than they counted.
As someone who makes their living on the river, Jones said it made no sense to electrofish after a fish-stressing summer beset by low flows and warm temperatures, adding: “I don’t know how many beatings the fish can take.”
The Big Hole is easily one of the most distressed “blue ribbon” trout streams in Montana.  It’s been chronically dewatered by over-appropriated irrigation withdrawals for decades.  Combine that with the declining precipitation and increasing temperatures of climate change from human-caused atmospheric pollution, and the river’s low flows and high water temperature woes were magnified to such an extent that the river was partially or fully closed to fishing for much of the summer.
When questioned about electroshocking the already severely stressed fish, the agency responded: “We added an abbreviated fall sampling effort during the MSU studies to provide an opportunity to recapture tagged fish before fall spawning and winter, which compartmentalizes the year in a way that will allow us to better characterize when mortality is occurring.”
They certainly were able to “characterize when mortality is occurring” — although the agency claimed “we didn’t see any immediate mortality during this fish sampling effort, clearly there was some impact.”
Indeed, for the Big Hole’s trout, it’s just another in a long line of “impacts” from gathering “data” for the MSU study.  As noted in its 2024 report, the Big Hole fish were already electroshocked, captured, “tranquilized with clove oil,” and had “internal and external passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag(s)” stuck in them — all of which required significant handling of the fish, which has been shown to have negative effects, including mortality.  Incredibly, the agency “conducted a recapture run about one week after the initial tagging event.”
At what point do we draw the line on death of fish and game by data gathering for state agencies, organizations, and/or universities?  Anglers and organizations had already complained about the agency re-opening fishing in violation of the Big Hole Watershed Committee’s drought plan when the flows were below 25%.  Despite public outcry, the already stressed fish were then electroshocked handled, counted, measured, weighed and tagged once again…from which many did not survive.
They can beat around the bush and kill fish through “data gathering” but the Big Hole’s primary problem is insufficient instream flows for the fish to survive and reproduce. That “critical data” is easily gathered by looking at the river’s stream gauges — and then doing something about it.

Industry leaders see a fertile political environment in the region, but say challenges lie ahead.
The post Wyoming, Utah and Idaho push for nuclear energy renaissance appeared first on WyoFile .","IDAHO FALLS—A couple hundred nuclear energy industry officials, along with two western state governors, a Trump administration official and the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, gathered Monday at the Idaho National Laboratory’s sprawling 890-square-mile testing center to discuss nuclear power’s future in the West.
In a large, posh tent with clear plastic walls offering views of the surrounding high-plains sagebrush steppe, these leaders, their staff and a gaggle of media gathered for a reception a short drive away from the world’s premier nuclear energy testing ground. 
“We’re standing here, not very far from where [Experimental Breeder Reactor II] proved out the fundamental technology that I believe is ultimately the future for humanity — for energy abundance, reliability and affordability,” Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of nuclear power plant developer Oklo, told the crowd. The success of 1960s-era EBR II was “one of the most phenomenal technological stories in human history and, frankly, one that’s radically under-told and underappreciated.”

After being pushed to the sidelines, nuclear energy technology is back in the spotlight, DeWitte noted. Today’s rush to feed power-hungry artificial intelligence and data computational centers has private investors and governments around the world pouring money into the next generation of nuclear energy, he said. That is already resulting in notable investments in Wyoming, including Bill Gate’s next-generation nuclear project in Kemmerer, but also raising questions about the potential for spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation in the Equality State. 
Here at INL, Oklo and subcontractor Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co. will build and test the first Aurora Powerhouse — a liquid-sodium-cooled “fast reactor” generating up to 75 megawatts of electricity that backers hope to deploy around the world. Oklo’s nuclear reactor demonstration is among a dozen or so reactor and nuclear fuel tests in queue at INL that advance the industry’s technology and business models, according to INL officials. The lineup includes Radiant Industry’s “portable” Kaleidos microreactor, which the company proposes to mass-produce in Wyoming at a facility outside Bar Nunn. 
Though Radiant’s proposal, along with another in Campbell County, has garnered significant opposition, Gov. Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.

“This is what an abundance mentality is all about,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in his opening remarks at the Western Governors’ Association workshop at INL’s Idaho Falls campus later that day. “It’s not Utah versus Idaho versus Wyoming. We’re going to be much stronger if we’re working together, because we have some differences that are important and similarities that are important.”
Energy ‘superabundance’ 
As chairman of the WGA this year, Cox launched the Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West initiative, which focuses on meeting skyrocketing electrical demand by bolstering nuclear energy. Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.
Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, Cox noted, already share infrastructure under utility Rocky Mountain Power, as well as a shared workforce and a similar “mindset” that’s attractive to the industry.
“I would love to have [Oklo] in Utah, and I can’t lie about that, but that’s good for all of us,” Cox said, adding that all three states are already on the industry’s radar.

The Department of Energy’s national laboratory in Idaho is an obvious draw, he noted. In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer. Rocky Mountain Power has tentatively agreed to take on the power plant and potentially partner with TerraPower to add more Natrium plants in Utah.
“I can just tell you, by signing that MOU together, it’s given this region much more interest from nuclear partners,” Cox said. “They’re seeing this as a game changer, and so they’re coming. I don’t care if they come to Wyoming or they come to Idaho or they come to Utah.”
The tristate initiative has the backing of the Trump administration, which has ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up nuclear licensing and has directed the DOE to have 10 new “large reactors” under construction by 2030 with a goal of adding 300,000 megawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2050. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.
Challenges 
Despite enthusiasm among private industry and state and federal officials, there are significant challenges to implementing a nuclear resurgence in the region.

Several speakers at the WGA event noted that AI and data center developers favor new power generation facilities that are, in a regulatory sense, apart from the shared electrical grid, or “behind the meter.” That complicates the utility regulatory environment and rate structures. Also, the U.S. is still reliant on other nations for nuclear components and several aspects of the fuel supply chain, which will take years to provide domestically. Others noted that the Trump administration’s demands on federal agencies — like fast-tracking and licensing a massive buildout of nuclear power plants — are at odds with recent staff downsizing.
Industry leaders are also worried about a dearth of workers for jobs that require specific training and certifications.
“We know that we need a significantly expanded workforce for the modernization and expansion of the grid,” Deloitte Specialist Executive Bill Abolt said. The nation’s long lull in building nuclear energy has left the industry with skilled experts who are retiring and an empty “pipeline” to replace them, he added. “The people that built the last nuclear power plant didn’t just stick around and wait for the next one.”
Though states have made advancements in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and training, nuclear fields have been a blind spot, several industry officials agreed.
“At some point, you need to figure out how to get Mike Rowe involved,” INL’s Innovation and Technology Manager Chris Lohse said, referring to the television personality who touts the nobility of skilled trades and “dirty” physical labor.
Yet perhaps the industry’s biggest challenge remains its image as a dangerous liability to human health and the environment — a legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, perpetuated in cinema and The Simpsons. Though the WGA event was stacked with those who are certain of the safety of the industry, some noted that local opposition to things like wind farms extends to nuclear energy proposals.
In fact, many residents in Bar Nunn and Gillette — communities that have long supported heavy energy industries — are not convinced they want to welcome nuclear facilities. Campbell County commissioners recently drafted a resolution to solidify their interim stance on the potential for spent nuclear fuel waste storage until putting the question to a public vote in the 2026 election. Until there’s a vote, the commission would remain opposed to such proposals.
“There is a lot of time that’s being spent engaging with communities, local governments and people on the ground who may have been upset about a wind turbine,” National Association of State Energy Officials Chief of Staff Cassie Powers said. “There does need to be some real, honest public engagement to demystify investments in nuclear.”

The latest fossils unearthed in Wyoming’s Natural Trap Cave include the skeleton of a mammoth. 
The post A mammoth discovery in the Bighorn Basin appeared first on WyoFile .","It was on one of the last days of the 2024 field season that a group of researchers got a hunch that they’d found something unusual at the bottom of an 85-foot cave in northern Wyoming. 
“We’d found a mammoth vertebra, just a centrum,” recalled Julie Meachen, a professor at Des Moines University Medicine and Health Sciences in Iowa. 
Since 2014, when Meachen and other scientists got the green light to excavate Natural Trap Cave in the Bighorn Basin, they’ve unearthed the bones of prehistoric mammals, including the American cheetah and short-faced bear.
As the name implies, the cave acted as a deadly trap for animals traveling the plains, unaware of the pit until it was too late. Their fossils — dating from 20,000 years ago — are often found in good condition since the cave’s cool and humid conditions act as a refrigerator. 
But mammoth bones aren’t common in the cave, Meachen told WyoFile.
“They’re not really running animals,” Meachen said. “They probably would have known the cave was there. They kind of look to where their feet go.”
So it was all the more a delight on one of the first days of the 2025 season when Meachen’s team began to uncover most of the mammoth’s cervical vertebrae, some of the thoracic vertebrae, some ribs and most of the scapula. 
“This is a pretty amazing find,” Meachen said. 
Then came the logistics.  
“We all kind of were like, ‘What are we going to do about this?’” she said. “Because the mammoth is a giant thing.”

The researchers can only access the cave by rappelling in, meaning any fossils found must exit by a pulley system. In the event a pesky reporter asks to shadow the group for a day of digging, they, too, are required to learn and use the ropes.
Little by little, Meachen said, the researchers dug through thick clay and got out as many fossils as they could before the 2025 season ended. 
“For the people of Wyoming, I think it’s really cool for them to understand their prehistoric heritage and what animals were there before the end of the last Ice Age.”

Surely Sen. Lummis, an attorney who took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, one whose congressional ancestors crafted the language she now seeks to unwind, understands the implications of greenlighting limitations of speech. 
The post Tone it down, senator. There is no fire in this theater. appeared first on WyoFile .","I did two things when I heard Sen. Cynthia Lummis was floating the idea of tinkering with the Constitution, downgrading the free speech clause of the First Amendment to a murky halfway house of kinda-sorta constitutional rights. 

Opinion

First, I checked the Wyoming State Bar to see whether she was licensed to practice law. 
Then I grieved.
In the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and a poorly timed monologue by late night TV comedian Jimmy Kimmel, Sen. Lummis stated she no longer considered speech under the First Amendment a guarantee. 
Surely the senator, an attorney who took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, one whose congressional ancestors crafted the language she now seeks to unwind, understands the implications of greenlighting limitations of speech. 
Kimmel’s Sept. 15th monologue mocked President Trump, questioning the depth of Trump’s grief. It was terrible and cruel. It was also the exact type of language the First Amendment protects. That’s the point. We do not become uneasy with free speech until we are outraged.  
Under the First Amendment, we can be provocative, we can say uncomfortable things, we can create works of art that make us squirm and challenge our belief systems, we give voice to the vile and despicable, the lewd and profane. 
We can choose to look or ignore, not because the government restricted our access to such expression, but because our democracy gives us agency. We are free to look away. Better yet, we are free to debate, to dialogue with our opponents. Just like Charlie Kirk did.  
Yet, Lummis told Semafor, a digital news site, “Under normal times . . . I tend to think that the First Amendment should always be sort of the ultimate right. And that there should be almost no checks and balances on it. I don’t feel that way anymore. I feel like something’s changed culturally. And I think that there needs to be some cognizance that things have changed.”
Speak more to this, senator. Who gets to decide what are “normal times”?  Walk us through the criteria for re-routing the First Amendment simply to conform to this fevered moment? Justify your turnabout from 2023, when you introduced the “Free Speech Protection Act” under the Biden administration, which sought to expand the very thing you now want to limit. 
I do not buy the argument that this time is different. Agreed, political violence — the rapidity of which is alarming — is on the rise. Yet,  I remain unconvinced Lummis’ menacing statement was made for the good of the order, rather than for the supplicating promise of power or pandering to a grieving and skittish base. 
Historian David McCullough reminded us there has never been a simple time in our history. Each generation carries its burden of crisis and conflict, charlatans and heroes, and an ugly catalog of political violence.  
Over a third of the presidents in the 20th century experienced assassination attempts, two of them were killed, according to PolitiFact. In the first half of the 20th century, during the Jim Crow era, ordinary citizens, especially Black Americans, were regularly lynched. The 1960s and 1970s experienced a dramatic rise in political violence when President John F. Kennedy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy and George Wallace were shot. President Trump himself has been the target of two assassination attempts.
Let’s not forget the violence of the Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol where, as described in the Jan 6th report, Oath Keeper Leader Steward Rhodes amassed an arsenal of military-grade assault weapons, spent approximately $7,000 on two night-vision devices and a weapon sight, an additional $6,000 on an AR-style rifle, and firearms attachments. Yet, I recall no efforts to downgrade speech in response to those actions.   
There are strategies to consider before we dicker with our founding documents. Quit re-posting the hate. Block the nutjobs. Don’t take the bait. Lock the gun cabinet. Do we really need to iron fist this moment above which we may rise?  
Raising political candidates is like having children. Our state loves and nurtures them. We see the promise in them. We grow and support them and happily send them out to the big wide world to represent us. Once launched, we hope they become someone to which the rest of the country aspires so that we can boast “look what noble statesmen we produced, this visionary, one with a keen intellect who sees beyond the gloomy horizon. You’re welcome.” 
But we do not live in times of statesmanship, and Sen. Lummis is not that. 
May this unnormal time be different, may we place people in positions of power with a steady hand, those who learn from history, its missteps and mistakes.  
Lummis’ statements were a knee jerk response to a lightening charged environment, one which gave license to the idea we can restrict language just because we don’t like it.  Her comments were reactionary, irresponsible and dangerous. 
Kind of like crying “fire!” in a crowded theater.

County budgets shouldn’t depend on ICE immigration efforts, writes Antonio Serrano.
The post Why Wyoming sheriffs shouldn’t take dollars for detainees appeared first on WyoFile .","To some, she’s a mother. A friend. A co-worker. A neighbor. 
But to Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp, she’s also a potential source of revenue. 

Opinion

That’s because for every immigrant detained by ICE agents and held in the Uinta County Jail, Kopp’s department gets paid $66 a day — barely enough to cover his costs, but he’s hoping to increase that to $120 a day — and he’s banking on detaining enough immigrants to collect $500,000 per year. By doing this, Kopp is putting a price on immigrants and is sending a clear message about how he and other law enforcement officials see the immigrant community — with dollar signs in their eyes.
Kopp has earmarked this money to give his deputies a raise — the Wyoming Legislature’s property tax cuts left the county with less revenue for salary increases. But immigrants didn’t raise the cost of food. Immigrants didn’t raise the cost of housing. And immigrants aren’t the ones creating hardships for working-class Wyomingites. (If you need a scapegoat, you should be looking at some of our elected officials and the wealthy people who support them.)
But Kopp and a growing number of other Wyoming sheriffs are now paid jailers for the Trump administration’s deportation machine. Making local government dependent on the federal government’s immigration system and the promise of a steady stream of detained immigrants is a dangerous game to play.
You see, while some Wyoming sheriffs have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, effectively turning local officials into ICE agents, Kopp has not yet. But his arrangement provides a more direct financial incentive to collaborate with federal immigration enforcement — and that poses significant threats to immigrant communities and the foundational principles of justice in Wyoming.

That’s because most people ICE arrested this year in Wyoming did not have a criminal history, according to data obtained from ICE, published by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by The Colorado Sun and WyoFile. The ICE arrest data contradicts the purported goals of the Trump administration to target the “worst of the worst.”
But this is not just about undocumented immigrants. This is about every immigrant in Wyoming — citizen, resident or otherwise — who now has to wonder if going to work, speaking Spanish or some other language, or just trying to exist in Wyoming makes them a target. And if the history and current reality of racial profiling in this country and here in Wyoming tells us anything, it’s that law enforcement will almost always lean on the “easiest” factor — skin color, accent or language — when making arrests. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary ruling earlier this month allowing federal immigration enforcement to use profiling to decide who to stop and detain. 
Most of us can agree that the federal government needs to do much better on immigration policy and identify real solutions that are orderly, humane and fair. But turning local law enforcement into an extension of the federal government is none of those things. Rather, it puts officers and their communities at risk and depletes much-needed resources.
Local law enforcement agencies that willingly carry out the business of the federal government are losing vital community support and trust while diminishing their efforts to improve public safety. Community policing, after all, works best when law enforcement has the trust and cooperation of its constituents. However, this cooperation is easily eroded when communities believe they cannot safely disclose criminal activity to local law enforcement for fear of deportation or imprisonment or that they may be the subject of racial or ethnic profiling. We warned lawmakers this would happen, but our warnings were not taken seriously and ignored.
Safer communities should not come at the expense of our immigrant friends and family. County budgets shouldn’t depend on detaining immigrants. Immigrant families are part of our communities, our congregations, our schools and our workplaces. Treating them as enemies to be rounded up and detained for dollars is unacceptable. Local authorities like Sheriff Kopp have no business contributing to that effort.
Uinta County and Wyoming stood up against immigration detention in the past, and we will do it again. Immigrants belong in Wyoming, and we’ll never stop fighting for them.

Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada once said his goal was to elect a Republican in all 95 House districts. Holding a supermajority wasn’t enough.
More than six years later, Casada is focused instead on staying out of prison after being sentenced to three years for his role in a fraudulent money laundering and kickback scheme involving his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who was sentenced to two and a half years. The duo ran a  secretive consulting firm called Phoenix Solution that tapped into a state-funded mailing program and then the Republican Caucus and House campaigns, kicking money back to Casada and former state Rep. Robin Smith.
Casada, a Franklin Republican, retired from office three years ago, staying one term after he stepped down from the speaker’s post amid pressure from fellow Republicans. He received no support at his sentencing hearing from the lawmakers he helped elect and put in leadership positions.
Casada seemingly had the Tennessee political world under his thumb as House Republican Caucus chairman and then majority leader, dishing out money to favored candidates who ran on an ultra-conservative platform in 2018. He parlayed that year’s victories into votes for the speakership, and after winning the powerful seat, formed new committees and rewarded Republicans and even a couple of Democrats with chairmanships to cement his control.
But the honeymoon didn’t last long. 
Complaints started flowing within the ranks about “hall monitors” who policed chit-chat at the Cordell Hull Building and reported to Casada. Then there were the “bill kill” lists that targeted even the legislation of fellow Republicans, and other forms of heavy-handed leadership, including hiring a political operative who went after Casada enemies but didn’t have to report to work. Lawmakers weren’t enthused either with Cothren’s $200,000 salary or the way the staffer tried to strong-arm votes during the final push to pass Gov. Bill Lee’s 2019 private-school voucher program. The plan provides funds to low-income students in Memphis and Nashville, and now Chattanooga, to enroll in private schools but is seen by critics as the beginning of the end of public schools.
Following a tie vote in April 2019, Casada held the vote board open for nearly 45 minutes to work the chamber for a tie-breaker. He was accused of calling Lee’s office while out on the House balcony that day to ask for a general’s rank in the Tennessee National Guard for former Democratic Rep. John Mark Windle in an effort to win his vote. Casada later denied making the request.
Then again, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson pointed out during this week’s sentencing hearing that Casada lied to FBI agents when they raided his home early on Jan. 8, 2021.
Casada was bent on delivering for the governor, and even though he brought in the votes, allegations started to fly and the FBI took notice, if it wasn’t already digging in on Capitol Hill.
A racist and sexist texting scandal engulfed Cothren and Casada shortly after the voucher vote, worsened by Cothren’s admission that he’d used cocaine in state offices, another strike against him that was brought up in sentencing two weeks ago. 
The duo had been feeding off each other as they partied in Nashville during those halcyon days, Cothren helping Casada relive his early years and Casada giving Cothren a modicum of authority as a 30-something. Cothren was even named one of the city’s most eligible bachelors by a local publication.
Suddenly, Cothren found himself forced out, and Casada was left to fend for himself.
He didn’t fare well when the Republican Caucus took a vote of no-confidence at a Nashville boutique hotel where a creepy penguin stood in a hallway and pictures of naked half-humans, half-bears hung on the wall.
When Casada emerged from the building that day in August 2019, he seemed dazed and confused. 
But what ensued turned out to be worse than setting the record for shortest speakership in modern history, about eight months. He left the office only after the governor said he would call a special session to find a new speaker.
Ultimately, that turned out to be Rep. Cameron Sexton of Crossville who also worked his way through the Republican ranks. Cothren would later claim he helped Sexton win support, saying phone records showed they communicated regularly, little of which came out in the Cothren-Casada trial this spring.
Casada continued to serve, even winning another two-year term. But he was a shell of his political self.
When FBI agents showed up at his Franklin door, he tried to play off any knowledge or association with Phoenix Solutions, though he admitted that Cothren had to keep his role in the company secret because lawmakers wouldn’t do business with him and Smith if they knew the former chief of staff was involved.

As federal prosecutor John Taddei said during the Tuesday sentencing hearing, “When the FBI confronted them, Mr. Cothren deflected and minimized; Mr. Casada straight up lied.”
After resigning, Cothren found himself having to replace a hefty paycheck, so he, Smith and Casada hatched the idea for Phoenix Solutions. It would go first for the constituent mailer program that Smith described as “low-hanging fruit” when she testified for federal prosecutors in their four-week trial.
It all went well at first, as most shady enterprises do. Lawmakers such as former Rep. Kent Calfee, whom Smith disrespected, Rep. Paul Sherrell, Rep. Jay Reedy, and former House finance chair Patsy Hazlewood unwittingly did business with Phoenix, not knowing that “Matthew Phoenix” was a fictitious character cobbled together by Cothren.
They brought in a relative pittance, about $52,000, ran it through Smith’s and Casada’s own consulting firms, and kicked part of the money back to the two lawmakers. Then they went for House Republican Caucus money and campaigns, netting about $159,000.
In May 2020, if not earlier, folks started getting suspicious, and the FBI stepped in. Connie Ridley, former director of Legislative Administration, whom Smith and Casada pushed to cut checks to Phoenix Solutions, started requiring all House vendors to fill out federal W-9 forms. Cothren signed the document as “Matthew Phoenix.” 
They were indicted Aug. 23, 2022. Smith agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, but Cothren and Casada held out, continuing to proclaim they’d done nothing wrong. In fact, a recent voice mail by Casada in which he continued to maintain he’d been running a perfectly legal business came back to haunt him during sentencing.
Only his wife, daughter and Sunday school teacher testified as character witnesses for him, with daughter Sarah Hoos saying that he’d become a better father since his downfall.
Just as Casada wasn’t satisfied with having Republicans in 75 seats in the House, giving them an overwhelming supermajority after decades of Democratic control, he always seemed to be looking for something else, another power lunch, another arm to twist, more authority.
In the end, that lust for control caused him to fall into perilous water, costing him his marriage and job. He told the Lookout before his arrest that he had found a new spiritual life. One wonders, though, if he could ever really surrender.
Out of leftfield
Casada defense attorney Ed Yarbro told the judge this week that his client had suffered enough at the hands of the “left-wing media” in requesting a light sentence, nothing but probation.
The problem: That argument didn’t hold up, even before a judge appointed by President Donald Trump.
Casada was ousted from the speakership by Republican lawmakers and a Republican governor, and Smith, a former Tennessee Republican Party chair, testified against him in return for a lesser punishment.  
None of the Republican lawmakers he helped came to his rescue either during sentencing – not one kind word. 
A former Republican political operative also provided the information that led to the scandal surrounding Cothren and Casada and their demise. 
The “left-wing media” didn’t have to manufacture anything, which is usually the case in political corruption. The powerful, regardless of political persuasion, write the ending to their own stories.
Polish your surfboards
State Rep. Todd Warner, a Cothren supporter, is drawing a bit of fire for blasting rock on his property in Marshall County for a 35-acre lake, according to a Tennessee Journal report.
Warner apparently started work on the lake without a permit before applying for a national water quality discharge permit. The lake will pull from the Duck River, which is caught up in a battle between development and protection.
A complaint shows the site is being used to mine limestone and that a portable crusher is on the site. Warner was notified that he needed a pollution discharge permit, which initially wasn’t required by the state because of a misunderstanding about how the property was being used, according to the report.
Warner told the Tennessee Journal he’s being targeted by “political adversaries” and added that the lake will be used for agricultural purposes only. He declined to speak on the record to the Lookout, citing the advice of his attorneys.
A zoning hearing is set for Sept. 30.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor) North Dakota’s agriculture commissioner warned lawmakers this week that federal trade and health policies are exacerbating concerns of farmers already worried about low ag commodity prices and high production costs.
In order to keep up, the average farm in North Dakota is borrowing 12 to 20 times more than the  average farm did in the 1980s, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said. 
“We’ll have to ride through this and see what happens,” Goehring told members of a legislative committee on Wednesday. 
North Dakota soybean growers anxiously await sales to China 

That borrowing could be a ticking time bomb, according to Rep. Mike Brandenburg, a Republican from Edgeley who also is a farmer. The lawmaker said farmers are “going to work really hard, take the crop out, and lose some money again” this year. Then this winter “bankers are going to put the squeeze on” any farmers who owe money and don’t have equity, he said. 
“That’s when things are going to fall apart,” Brandenburg said.
Brandenburg expects farmers will have to make “hard decisions” this winter if they don’t have equity. Even if they don’t lose the farm, they may be forced to sell off some land or rent it out to make up for a shortfall with what they’ve borrowed from the bank, he said.
Trade impacts
Most of the world is producing a record amount of ag commodities like soybeans and corn. But the agriculture commissioner said there’s still a deficit in some parts of the world. 
“We still have quite a deficit for commodities and food in the eastern hemisphere, which means that we’ll continue to try and do as much business as we can given policies and trade issues,” Goehring said.
The biggest barrier to that is the federal government’s trade policy and tariffs. A trade deal with China, traditionally a major customer for North Dakota’s soybean production, is being held up for non-trade reasons according to Goehring. 
“It’s more political than anything else,” he said. 
Goehring told lawmakers that farmers’ breakeven prices for soybeans are usually around $10.32, corn is around $3.80 and wheat can break even at $6. But those commodities are only fetching $8.65 for soybeans, $1.60 for corn, and $4.70 for wheat. And the prices for soybeans can be deceptive. 
“In some cases, elevators have said they won’t take anything because they don’t have a home for it,” Goehring said of soybeans. 
One contributor to the low prices are the tariffs President Donald Trump has implemented against countries across the world, including several customers for North Dakota’s ag products. 
“The ag community is trying to be patient and they’re looking at this and saying ‘yes, we need fair trade deals,’” Goehring said. “But at some point, rubber meets the road and they owe their creditors and they owe the bank.”
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., on Wednesday met with a group of North Dakota farmers and ag industry professionals. 
She said in an interview there are negotiations taking place in Congress to provide some short-term help for farmers, perhaps through tariff revenue, to get them through the winter financially. 
Goehring isn’t sure financial relief from the federal government will be enough. 
“I don’t know if you can write a big enough check through the federal government to cover losses,” he said. 
In addition to a lack of exports, Fedorchak and Goehring said farmers also are concerned about the cost of inputs like fertilizer. China is a major supplier of fertilizer. 
MAHA’s ‘attack’  on North Dakota ag
A growing issue for North Dakota’s agriculture industry, Goehring said, is the Make America Healthy Again movement championed by national figures like Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“They’ve now turned their attention to attack seed oils,” Goehring said.

North Dakota is a leading producer of sunflowers and canola, which are used to make some of the oils the MAHA movement opposes.
Goehring said Kennedy and others at the forefront of the MAHA movement have been pushing the use of animal fats like butter instead and have made disparaging comments about food and agriculture. 
“You can’t trust them anymore,” Goehring said. “Above everything else, we live in the United States of America. We have embraced choices in agriculture and food, in our lifestyles, for decades. For centuries. Now all of a sudden we have people who want to dictate and pull that freedom away.”

Amin has headed the program for nearly a year. (Photo courtesy of Help4WV)Help4WV, the state’s only 24/7 call line for people struggling with substance use disorder and mental health, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, marking 10 years of assisting individuals and families affected by addiction in West Virginia.

Salwa Amin, program director for the helpline, said over that time employees who staff it have helped connect thousands of people to recovery services, support those struggling with a mental health episode, educate family members on how they can assist their loved ones who have substance use disorder and more.
“It is kind of incredible to think about how far [Help4WV] has been able to come in a decade’s time,” Amin said.
Help4WV — which is run through First Choice Services — actually launched before 2015, said Sheila Moran, director of marketing and communications for First Choice Services. Back then, though, the program was different and not nearly as wide reaching.
Because of the way it was funded, until 2015 the line could only be used to help people who were living with addiction related to prescription drugs.
“Back then, if there was a call because of someone using alcohol, marijuana, [struggling with] mental health, really any other drugs outside of prescription pills, we couldn’t do anything. In 2015 — that’s when we really started to become the [helpline] that we are today,” Moran said. “I think that happened at a really important time. There was so much more going on, so much more that people were struggling with and we wanted to help.”
Since its launch, Moran said she’s seen several changes in the addiction and recovery environment. The number of available treatment beds and programs has grown, meaning more options for people looking to enter recovery. There are more services — like medically assisted treatment and opioid treatment programs — available to refer people to. Overall, and while there’s still much work remaining, there is more of a willingness to see addiction as a disease instead of a moral failing today than 10 years ago, Moran said.
“We’ve come a long way in just 10 years. The work is not all done, clearly, but it is a different environment today,” Moran said. “I think that does make me hopeful for what the next 10 years could look like.”
The organization partners with hundreds of other entities all across West Virginia — detox centers, recovery and rehabilitation homes, medically assisted treatment facilities and more — to ensure callers are connected with the services they need wherever and whenever they need them. 
Amin, who has headed the program for almost a year now, said those types of connections are critical but just a part of what call line workers do.
Another crucial part to the work, she said, is making sure people who call feel heard and are really connecting with the person on the other end of the line.
“That connection is a critical part of the work we do. It’s hard to get someone help if you don’t take the time to listen, and that’s what our employees really focus on — understanding someone’s whole story so they have a better understanding of what kind of help would be best at that particular time,” Amin said. “We really focus on that, and we’re proud that we operate from a very human-first approach.”
Nearly every person who works taking calls on the Help4WV line has lived experience with addiction and is in long-term recovery themselves. Amin said this experience allows call-takers to have a particular understanding of how someone who is calling in could be feeling.
“They actually know what someone means when they say they’re having a bad day, or if they call in and say they’ve relapsed,” Amin said. “A lot of people — when they call us, they are in a really dark place. They could be at their lowest point. It’s important that, at that point, they’re not being judged or feeling attacked. They can know that whoever they’re talking to has likely been in a similar situation before, and that on its own helps.”
Moran said an overarching philosophy at Help4WV is making every call as personal as it can be. While it’s operated 24/7, workers are committed to keeping wait times as low as possible. Callers aren’t diverted through phone trees or other automated messages. The first voice they hear, Moran said, is always a human one.
Call traffic can fluctuate throughout the day, as well. It tends to be heavier in mornings and afternoons and, sometimes, evening hours. Over night, call load may shrink, Moran said, but sometimes those calls are the most critical.
Most importantly, said Amin, someone will be there at any time a call is made.
“We’re always going to be fully staffed, ready to take just one call or take 10,” Amin said. “That’s crucial to the services we’re offering and the people who rely on us.”
Amin is in long-term recovery from addiction herself. She said she remembers what it felt like, before she entered recovery, to not know where to turn if she did want help. Now, she said, she doesn’t want anyone to feel they have to navigate that situation alone.
Callers can help find treatment and detox beds for individuals in any part of the state. If someone is looking for a support group meeting, they can tell them the closest one. And if people need help getting to services, call-takers can set them up with programs that offer free transportation.
While most of the callers are calling for themselves, Amin said it’s not unusual for family members to reach out and ask questions on how to support their loved ones.
“Parents will call asking how to help their children and vice versa. There’s not one type of person that calls our line, and there’s not just one type of service that can help them,” Amin said. “That’s why we really make the effort to hear everything they’re willing to share.”
Nothing is forced upon people who call. Call-takers might make suggestions, Amin said, but any action taken is decided upon wholly by the person seeking help. 
Amin and Moran both said they feel hopeful over the state’s recent progress in lowering the rate of fatal drug overdoses. They hope that progress persists and becomes a continued trend to slow what has been a devastating epidemic in West Virginia in beyond.
Amin said those at Help4WV are proud to contribute to this work whenever and however possible.
“We’ve lost so, so many people — too many people — to this epidemic. Even while I’m happy to see that maybe we are starting to turn things around, we’re still losing too many people,” Amin said. “If we’re able to connect even one person to help, to make them feel heard and seen and realize that there is help, then we want to do that. We want to do that for anyone who needs it.”
If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction and looking for assistance, you can call or text Help4WV at 1-844-HELP4WV or visit here to chat with someone online.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline) The Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee this week approved on a 4-2 vote a $2.8 million supplemental budget request from the Colorado Department of Corrections to add 153 more private prison beds. 
The additional funding will go to the department even though it is also required to make an extra effort to reduce its inmate population. The provisions of a 2018 law in August were triggered for the first time after the state prisons’ vacancy rate had been below 3% for more than 30 consecutive days. Those conditions under the law require the department to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population.
Criminal justice reform advocates as well as Democratic leaders of both the state House and Senate judiciary committees wrote to the Joint Budget Committee earlier this month urging members to vote against the DOC’s budget request, citing the department’s limited efforts to efficiently reduce the prison population as the 2018 law requires.

The advocate letter, led by the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition and signed by 72 other organizations that make up the No More Prisons coalition, said the budget request is based on a projected increase in the male prison population but “ignores DOC’s own role in driving prison bed demand.” 
“Before funding more beds, there should be scrutiny of whether DOC is doing all it can within its control to reduce demand for more prison beds,” the letter says. 
Christie Donner, executive director of the CCJRC, said the lawmakers failed “to ask the harder questions” about the department’s population management efforts, noting that there have been several recent state audits that found the department could implement efficiencies and better practices for its budget and security classification system. 
“Our whole point is, hold the department to a higher standard of performance instead of just giving them more beds,” Donner said. “The Department of Corrections is in this weird situation where the worse they do, the more money they get.”
The letter CCJRC led calls for an independent audit of DOC policies around transitioning people in custody to parole and back into their communities. Donner said that’s where she sees “a lot of the breakdown and bogginess” in the department. For example, some prisoners will go to a parole board hearing before they have an approved parole plan. 
Donner also said that the department’s funding for programming does not automatically increase as the population increases — so the more people there are in custody, the less capacity the department has to offer programming. 










The Department of Corrections is in this weird situation where the worse they do, the more money they get.


– Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition


The Judiciary Committee letter said the JBC should deny the budget request because the prison population management measures should be given more time to work before the state spends unbudgeted tax dollars on more prison beds, “especially in the context of the state’s present, severe fiscal constraints.”
The committee’s letter also said DOC should better use community corrections beds and reform its classification system, because the vacancies in lower security beds are much higher than others and could be better used. 
“Approval of yet another supplemental request for more beds under the existing methodologies amounts to doubling down on admittedly failed practices,” the letter says. 
Justin Brakke, a legislative budget and policy analyst, told the JBC Monday that the DOC could use the newly funded beds to address the backlog of people sentenced to prison who are held in county jails. He said the state budgets for just over 250 people to be temporarily held in county jails, but the backlog is closer to 500 people right now.
DOC spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez-Garcia said the supplemental funding “complements” its use of prison population management measures to maximize capacity and “maintain safe, secure, and appropriately staffed bed space” amid the growing prison population. 
“The Colorado Department of Corrections has a dual responsibility: to effectively manage our current population using all available tools, including population management measures, and to ensure we have the capacity to safely house all individuals sentenced to our custody by the courts,” Gonzalez-Garcia said in a statement.

Members of the JBC were in agreement that they do not want to see the department use the new beds to artificially inflate vacancy rates, and that any additional funding requests related to beds would be denied if they are not used to reduce the jail backlog. Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican, and Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, voted in support of the request, while Sen. Judy Amanile, a Boulder Democrat, and Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, voted against it. 
Amabile said she doesn’t want to “just keep approving more beds” because that means there is “no pressure on the system to actually make the reforms that need to be made.” She said she doesn’t want “dangerous people” to be released from custody, but that the state has many in custody who do not pose a risk to the public, and she wants to see progress on releasing them. 
“I want us to be smart about public safety, because the thing that will make us the safest is making sure that we are rehabilitating people, that we are doing everything we can to get the people who are going to be released ready to be released and setting them up for success,” Amabile said.  
People in custody who are older and sick cost the state more money as it has to pay for their health care, Amabile said, and moving them into nursing homes where they could be covered by Medicaid or Medicare would save the state money. 
The waitlist for the state’s sex offender treatment program, which is required for some people with indeterminate sentences to be eligible for parole, has a long backlog too, Amabile said, and people are still in prison after they are eligible for parole just because they have not received the treatment. The state is subject to a class action lawsuit because of peoples’ inability to access the required treatment program. 
Technical parole violations have also significantly increased the prison population, and Amabile said there may be better options to address those violations instead of automatically sending someone back to prison. Donner said parole revocation is the largest driver of the growing prison population. 
Colorado is in an increasingly tight budget environment due to rising program costs and a slowing economy, as well as the federal tax cut and spending bill Congress passed earlier this year that reduced income tax revenue in the state. Supplemental funding approved by the JBC comes from the state’s reserves, or savings, and will need to be accounted for when the state prepares its budget next year, potentially affecting other state funding for programs like Medicaid and K-12 education, Amabile said. 
In the budget for the current fiscal year, state legislators originally reduced the number of beds in the DOC by 300, but the department asked for more in a June supplemental request and then again in September. Donner said she anticipates the department will continue to request supplemental funding for more beds and in the next fiscal year’s budget too, so it will be “a big issue” in the 2026 legislative session.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Once again Idaho state Rep. Wendy Horman, the chief proponent for voucher subsidies for private schools, has not spent enough time reading the Idaho Constitution. 
Responding to a lawsuit against House Bill 93, which provides $50 million in voucher subsidies to private schools, Horman told the media that she is confident the Idaho Supreme Court will rule against the plaintiffs.

“If constitutionality is their main concern, we welcome that argument and welcome the opportunity to prove how this is constitutional,” according to Idaho Education News.
Further, she said that if the voucher subsidy is unconstitutional, so is the popular Idaho Launch program. That program provides state funding for students to attend postsecondary education.
Here’s the problem with Horman’s thinking.
She seems to assume that the lawsuit against House Bill 93 is based on a violation of Article 9, Section 5 of the Idaho Constitution which prohibits the state from using taxpayer dollars – or in this case dollars diverted from the state general fund – to pay for religious school tuition. But she is wrong. The lawsuit filed this week is not based upon that prohibition. 
Instead, the plaintiff’s lawsuit is based on Article 9, Section 1 of the Idaho Constitution. That section makes it clear that the Legislature’s constitutional mandate is to “establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” 
The lawsuit points out that private schools are not general, uniform, thorough, free, common or open to all students. There is not even a hint in the Constitution that the taxpayers can or must finance any type of education besides Idaho’s public schools.
The plaintiffs include the Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution; Mormon Women for Ethical Government; the Moscow School District; Republican Rep. Stephanie Michelsen of Idaho Falls; Kristine Anderson, mother of students with special needs in the Madison School District;  Marta Hernandez, a member of the Idaho Education Association and educator at Burley Junior High; Alexis Morgan, an Idaho parent; and former Republican State School Superintendent Jerry Evans, who served from 1979 to 1995. 
“Using taxpayer funds, House Bill 93 created a governmental system contrary to the constitution that is not general, uniform, thorough, or free,” according to Shawn Tiegs, superintendent of the Moscow School District, which voted to join the suit at a special meeting this week. “We support ample and appropriate school choice through public charters and other avenues that also protect the rights of every student to receive a quality public education. We must keep the real choice with students and families — not with a private entity or organization that excludes students at taxpayer expense.”
Advocacy coalition files lawsuit to block Idaho’s new private school tax credit

Parent and plaintiff Alexis Morgan’s child was denied admittance to a private religious school on religious grounds. Morgan told a press conference on Wednesday, “I am standing here in defense of public education. Our constitutional framers knew that public education is vital for Idaho to thrive.”
It seems that Rep. Horman does not see that the lawsuit makes the case that the Legislature is not currently meeting its constitutional mandate to adequately fund a “uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.”
As co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee Rep. Horman should know that Idaho ranks last in the country on how much it spends on public education. She should also be aware that there is a backlog of more than $1 billion in public school facility improvements across the state. She has probably read the Legislature’s Office of Performance Evaluations report that says there is a $82 million funding gap for special needs students. She should also know that most school districts across the state need their property taxpayers to pick up the shortfall caused by the lack of state funding from the Legislature.
Let’s make it clear – the Idaho Constitution does not give local property taxpayers the burden of establishing and funding their public schools. Rather the Constitution gives that mandate to lawmakers like Rep. Horman.
In short, Rep. Horman’s budget committee and the Idaho Legislature are not currently meeting their constitutional mandate to fund our public schools.
Furthermore, the Constitution does not give the Legislature any authority to fund private schools. If the state’s founders favored funding private schools, with zero accountability on how taxpayers’ dollars are spent, they would have clearly addressed it in the Idaho Constitution. 
Aside from being unconstitutional, school vouchers are unpopular with the public. In the 2023 legislative session, Rep. Horman opposed House Bill 339, which called for an advisory vote of the people on school vouchers in the 2024 general election. Rep. Mickelsen relates in her affidavit supporting the HB 93 lawsuit that Horman told her at the time that voters would reject vouchers. The 32,336 pleas that Gov. Brad Little received from the public this year to veto House Bill 93 speaks volumes.
For the record, here is exactly what the state’s founders wrote in the Idaho Constitution: “The stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.”
It can’t get any clearer than that.

More than 500,000 low- and moderate-income Tennesseans rely on the enhanced tax credits, which significantly lower the cost of insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.
Without the credits, rising health insurance premiums are expected to price millions out of health coverage and shift the burden for providing uncompensated care to hospitals, which by law are required to provide certain medical services regardless of whether insurance will cover them.
In Tennessee, demand for uncompensated care could rise by 29.2% or $378 million beginning in 2026 if the tax credits expire, an analysis by the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found. The analysis noted that rural communities could see the biggest financial hits from a surge in uninsured residents. Currently nine rural hospitals in Tennessee are at risk for closure.
Tennessee is among 15 states that would experience the largest increases in uncompensated care. Nine of these states, including Tennessee, have not expanded Medicaid.  
The enhanced subsidies were put in place in 2021 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic . Extending the subsidies has been a key source of contention in Congress’s current budget negotiations..
The Republican-controlled U.S. House passed a seven-week spending bill last week that didn’t include a continuation of the Affordable Care Act Marketplace tax enhancements. Democrats in the U.S. Senate have refused to provide the votes necessary to overcome the 60-vote filibuster to pass it.
Instead, Democrats have proposed a four-week funding measure that would permanently keep the tax credits in place.
Without a bipartisan agreement to avert a government shutdown by Sept. 30, the subsidies will come to an end.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentuckians stand to lose more years off their lives due to power plant emissions than residents of almost any other state, according to a first of its kind national report released Thursday. 
In the Commonwealth Fund’s State Scorecard on Climate and Health, researchers ranked Kentucky as 50th overall among the 50 states and District of Columbia for health impacts of electricity generation emissions, flood risk posed to health care facilities, energy efficiency policies, health sector greenhouse gas emissions and more. Only West Virginia ranked lower.
Michael Seilback, the nationwide advocacy and state public policy expert at the American Lung Association, said the pollution in Kentucky’s air contributes to asthma attacks, lung cancers and premature death.

“When we turn on a light switch, we don’t often think about where that energy is coming from,” Seilback told the Lantern. “And what we’re talking about here is that these power plants that are fueled from coal — the burning of that coal to produce energy produces massive amounts of emissions.”
Kentucky’s longstanding loyalty to coal is “a major contributor to the state’s poor grade” in this report, Seilback said. About 68% of Kentucky’s electricity generation came from coal in 2023, the third-largest share among the states after West Virginia and Wyoming, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
“Often we think about how much energy you’re using in your house, and that’s relevant, but the question is, ‘where is that energy coming from?’” Seilback said. “If you were able to say all of Kentucky was being powered through wind, solar, hydropower, there would be less of a concern about using electricity because you weren’t producing all those emissions.”  
This report “should be another data point for decision makers to say ‘we really need to move away from fossil fuels and towards green energy, which will improve the health of Kentucky residents,’” Seilback said. 
Cabinet for Health and Family Services data shows 12,266 people visited emergency departments in Kentucky for asthma treatment in 2024. There were more than 1,000 hospitalizations, as well, and 34 deaths related to asthma that same year. Air pollution can cause asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, as well as worsen its symptoms. 
“The exposure to these pollutants are literally shortening people’s lives,” Seilback said. 
Kentucky has the nation’s highest rates of cancer and lung cancer.

Among the eight indicators on which each state was evaluated, Kentucky ranked best on risks facing health care facilities from natural hazards, defined as vulnerability of health care facilities to natural hazards. “On average, health care facilities in Kentucky are located in areas facing less risk from natural hazards than facilities in other states,” the report states.
At the same time, Kentucky’s  number of inpatient beds in high-hazard flood zones significantly raises the flood risk to the state’s health care facilities, according to the report.
Hawaii ranked worst on health harms from electricity generation, the report said, because of the islands’ high use of petroleum to generate power. Kentucky and West Virginia ranked next worst. The researchers quantified health effects of power plant pollution by using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) — described as “a common measure of the burden of disease, representing years of healthy life lost” — to calculate “the standardized health burden for every unit of electricity generated.”
“In Kentucky, emissions from electricity generation result in more negative health impacts per unit of electricity than in other states,” the report says. “Negative health impacts are represented by years of healthy life lost.” 
The commonwealth is joined by Louisiana and West Virginia as the worst-ranked states overall, meaning they “face more frequent and intense hazards and lack supportive energy and environmental policies.” 
The highest ranking states in the report are Vermont, New York and Washington, meaning those states “have lower environmental risk and vulnerability as well as stronger decarbonization and clean energy policies.” 
Dr. Joseph R. Betancourt, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement that “I hope this scorecard inspires states to learn from one another’s efforts to reduce pollution, prepare for environmental risks, and better protect people’s health.”
Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

“As a physician, I have seen firsthand how closely the environment and health are linked,” Betancourt said. “People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather.” 
Calls to action for Kentucky and beyond 
The Commonwealth Fund, founded in 1918, is a private foundation seeking to improve the country’s health care system through independent research and grantmaking. The report recommends a series of policies for states and health systems to consider. They include: 

Prioritize decarbonizing energy sources and improving efficiency, through mechanisms like renewable portfolio standards and updated building energy codes, to reduce emissions and protect public health.
Set health care decarbonization goals and incentivize performance improvement through payment reforms in Medicaid as well as private and employer insurance.
Require standardized, verified and transparent reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, strategic planning, and mitigation targets by health care facilities and their suppliers.
Prioritize building resilience to extreme weather; expand public health investment in relief centers and early warning systems, especially in high-risk areas.
Assign executive-level sustainability responsibility and employ designated leaders at each health care facility.
Collect and report sustainability and resilience data in areas prioritized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and The Joint Commission.
Purchase reusable and environmentally preferable products and champion waste reduction and clean energy.

Seilback, with the Lung Association, said the Trump administration’s moves to undo “many air quality protections” have put more responsibility on states to act. 
“Without a strong federal government, we really need state and local bodies to step up,” he said. “We want to see more investments in the wide range of cleaner, greener technologies.”

Nearly a month after school leaders demanded greater transparency, the State Board of Education voted Thursday to support raising the benchmarks — or cut scores — for math and English, setting off a debate over how the changes will affect classrooms.
The decision to raise the cut scores, which determine whether K-12 students meet proficiency standards — has been a priority for Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration. The goal is to align Virginia’s benchmarks with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a move officials say will help students develop deeper problem-solving skills. 
Youngkin’s appointed Board of Education is weighing concerns from education leaders who warn the changes could harm equitable access,contribute to teacher burnout, and lower graduation rates. The current cut scores for math and English were set in 2016 and 2017.
“We’re measuring today’s proficiency expectations using outdated benchmarks,” said Board of Education President Grace Creasey. “Approving new cut scores are necessary to reflect proficiency expectations for mastery of our more rigorous 2023 mathematics and 2024 English standards.”
On Thursday, the board endorsed the recommendation by Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson and the standards setting committee to raise the cut scores, capping off a yearslong process that included adopting tougher academic standards in 2023 and 2024 and aligning state assessments.
The initiative is part of Youngkin’s push to close the “honesty gap,” the disparity between Virginia’s proficiency standards and NAEP benchmarks, which often show students performing worse on the national exam than on state tests. 
For several years, a score of 400 has been enough to pass. But the new recommendations push proficiency minimums higher: in grade 4 reading, the committee proposed 444, up from 400, and the superintendent 449; in Algebra I, the committee recommended 445 and the superintendent.
The new performance standards will not take effect until spring 2026.

Tiara Booker-Dwyer, the Virginia Department of Education’s deputy superintendent of Student Outcomes and School Quality, told the board that the department will meet directly with school leaders to discuss the impacts of the new cut scores and develop support plans. The board is expected to vote on a phased implementation model — lasting no fewer than four years — at its Oct. 24 meeting.
“We have impact data by divisions, and we’re going around the month of October to each division, to share that impact data with them, to talk through strategies on the support that’s needed,” Booker-Dwyer said. “That’s why we’re coming back to the board in October for approval of the phase-in model because we can make tweaks, we want to make sure we’re doing what’s right for the school divisions and honoring requests that they have made.”
Gullickson emphasized the importance of the vote, adding that it was “the most critical” action because it reaffirms Virginia’s commitment to its students and their future.
“I am excited that every parent in the commonwealth and teacher and principal and superintendent and, most importantly, students will have the confidence that as they walk across that stage, they know that it means that they are truly ready for the pathway that they are being called to pursue,” Gullickson said.
Ahead of the October vote, the board will also consider a policy plan to add a temporary ”approaching” category to recognize progress toward proficiency during the phase-in. The plan would also revise score reports for parents to include details such as “score earned, performance level, content mastery, growth areas, and strategies and resources to advance learning,” while expanding professional development and resources for teachers and families.
Rodney Jordan, a representative for the Virginia School Boards Association, said the group supports higher expectations but stressed they must come with adequate resources. 
“VSBA remains dedicated to support excellent student outcomes for each and every public school student,” Jordan said. “Critical to achieving that goal is communicating with clarity and transparency the current reality for students and the instruction resources and support necessary to ensure student success.”
Phillip Abou-Zaki, who identified as having experience in the plumbing pipeline industry, said raising proficiency expectations will better prepare students for the workforce, because graduates are currently not ready to step into specific fields, including plumbing, which supports hospitals and universities.
“We hire promising young people who are motivated and hardworking, but they struggle with the math needed to do the job that slows down their progress, creates frustration and ultimately limits their earning potential,” Abou-Zaki said.

Millions of dollars have been invested in the region to plug the old coal mines, restore the land, and repurpose the space for economic development. Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced last week that an additional $11 million will open up another round of applications.
“Virginia thrives when every region has the resources it needs to grow,” Youngkin said in a news release. “This funding honors Southwest Virginia’s mining legacy by investing in its economic future, with projects that build infrastructure, attract new jobs, and revitalize its communities.”
Since the program began in 2017, funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have supported efforts to convert former mine lands into industrial parks, energy projects and other infrastructure uses. In 2023, the program was awarded a record $23 million to be used over the next 15 years. There have been 50 projects since its inception.
“It’s that things like mine openings are closed off, high-walls taken down, new roads are built near the areas that were affected by mining operations, or new economic centers are built on or near what was previously mining lands,” said Richard Borean, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Energy.
The program addresses Abandoned Mine Lands — portions of land disturbed by past mining \ that were never restored to their original state. That practice was banned under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
“There are thousands of acres of land impacted by mining in Virginia, with approximately 7,000 abandoned mine land features. Approximately 100,000 acres have been impacted in Southwest Virginia,” Borean said.
Virginia was one of six states in this round of funding to receive grants from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). Counties with coal mine histories must demonstrate their development plans to qualify for the money.
Virginia has a long history of coal mining, with the first commercial coal field opening in Richmond in 1758. Today, only one coal field remains operational in the southwest region, with 45 active mines.
“AMLER is part of a broader strategy that combines workforce development, infrastructure investment, and entrepreneurship to drive prosperity. These funds give communities the flexibility to pursue the projects that matter most to their future,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura in a news release.
Examples of past projects that utilized this funding include the Trammel Community Revitalization in Dickenson County, site preparation for the Wise County IDA solar project, and parking and trails improvements near Devil’s Bathtub in Scott County. Applications for the latest round of funding are due Dec. 18.

An analysis of 10 years of election results — president, governor, senate and every other partisan statewide race. On average, Republicans win 55%-45% over Democrats.
With that breakdown, Democrats proposed a redrawn map with eight seats leaning red, seven blue.
But right now, Ohio’s 15 congressional districts are made up of 10 Republicans and five Democrats.
Catherine Turcer with Common Cause Ohio, a nonprofit that advocates for fair maps, said that’s a problem.
“It’s very hard to have accountable government if the district lines favor political parties so hard to the right or so hard to the left,” Turcer said.


She is concerned because Republicans haven’t introduced a map yet, and the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting’s deadline to pass a bipartisan map is Sept. 30.



“This is one of those situations where a picture is worth 1,000 words and that they have not actually begun this process in good faith is incredibly sad,” she said.
GOP party leaders said they want at least 12 of the 15 districts to lean Republican.
“Four Democrat counties in Ohio, three split counties and 79 Republican counties,” state Rep. Nick Santucci (R-Niles) said during the committee’s meeting Monday, noting a 2025 county commission map. “What do we say to the other counties that are solidly red? Do we just say, ‘Well, sorry, too bad?'”
Santucci and GOP leader Tony Schroeder argued that Democrats make up nearly half of the voting base, but they are primarily located in only a few urban areas: Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton, and Athens, based on a WEWS/OCJ analysis. These areas have different priorities and demographics from red districts, Schroeder said.
“This would create situations where people in rural Ohio, especially, would be governed by people directly in urban centers,” he said.



There’s a solution for Democrats, he added.
“They can move,” according to Schroeder.
Democrats swiftly rejected this proposal.
“So you want people to move out of Franklin County, in the city of Columbus, to rural counties just to make things fair for a map?” state Sen. Bill DeMora said on Monday. “I mean, that’s utter ridiculousness.”
Turcer threw the argument back to the GOP, saying that just because the Republicans are more spread out, it doesn’t mean they get to supersede Democratic voices.
“Land doesn’t vote,” she said.
Urban and urban-suburban areas, where 45% of Ohio voters live, shouldn’t have to be governed by the rural areas, either, Democrats said.
Asked if a 12-3 or 13-2 map was reflective of the voter populace, Turcer said “well, of course not.”
The Republican leaders say that they won’t have a map by the constitutional deadline, which means the GOP-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission will take over the process in October.
Deadlines and process
Sept. 30: The lawmakers need to pass a map with at least 60% in each chamber, and at least 50% support of Democrats.
If that fails, it goes to the ORC.
Oct. 31: To meet this deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve.
If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Nov. 30: A map can also pass with a simple majority in the General Assembly, but it must be replaced after four years.
Republicans haven’t introduced their own map yet, but party leaders say they want at least 12 districts to lean red.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Hours after Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Suzanne Swierc shared two thoughts on her private Facebook page — that the killing of the right-wing activist was wrong, and that his death reflected “the violence, fear and hatred he sowed.”
The post upended her life.
Indiana Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita soon obtained a screenshot of the post by Swierc, an administrator at Ball State University, and added it to an official website naming and shaming educators for their comments about Kirk.
Libs of Tik Tok, a social media account dedicated to mocking liberals, shared her comments with its 4.4 million followers on X. A week after the post, the university fired her.
“The day that my private post was made public without my consent was one of the worst days of my life,” Swierc told reporters this past week. She said she received calls, texts and other harassing messages, including one suggesting she should be killed, that left her terrified.
A wave of firings and investigations has swept through academia and government in the wake of Kirk’s death, as state agencies, colleges and local school districts take action against employees over comments perceived as offensive or inappropriate. Dozens of workers in higher education alone have lost their jobs.
A Texas State University student was expelled after he publicly reenacted Kirk’s assassination; Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans had called for the student’s expulsion. Clemson University in South Carolina fired one worker and removed two professors from teaching. The University of Mississippi fired an employee. An Idaho Department of Labor employee was terminated.
The purge is driven in part by Republican elected officials who are encouraging Americans to report co-workers, their children’s teachers and others who make comments seen as crossing the line. They have been egged on by the Trump administration, with Vice President JD Vance urging listeners of Kirk’s podcast to call the employer of anyone “celebrating” his killing.
President Donald Trump has threatened to expand the crackdown beyond Kirk, warning falsely in the Oval Office last week that negative press coverage of him is “really illegal,” despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press.
Trump headlines Arizona memorial service for Charlie Kirk at packed stadium

At Kirk’s memorial service, Trump said, “I hate my opponent.” His choice to lead the Federal Communications Commission threatened ABC over comments about the reaction to Kirk’s death made by the late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel and the network pulled his show for several days.
Mark Johnson, a First Amendment attorney based in Kansas City, Missouri, who has been practicing law for 45 years, said he had never seen a moment like the current one.
“Not even close,” Johnson said. “What’s been happening in the last month is astonishing.”
In Indiana, Rokita is using his office’s “Eyes on Education” webpage to publicize examples of educators who have made controversial remarks about Kirk. The page, billed as a transparency tool, housed a hodgepodge of submitted complaints about teachers and schools in the past. Now, it also includes 28 Kirk-related submissions as of Thursday afternoon.
Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden threatened to strip an entire town of federal funding after a high school math teacher noted on her personal Facebook page that Kirk had in the past said some gun deaths are worth it to have the Second Amendment. The teacher has been suspended.
Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who is leaving his job next month to head up a conservative teachers organization, has launched investigations of school employees in response to tips submitted to Awareity, an online platform that allows parents and others to report concerns. Last week the Oklahoma State Department of Education said it had received 224 reports of “defamatory comments.”
Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Fine has urged people with information about anyone celebrating Kirk’s death who works in government in Florida to contact his office. And South Carolina Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace wants federal funding cut off for any school that fails to fire or discipline staff who “glorify or justify” political violence.
“It’s at a scale never before seen and I think it’s completely unhinged,” Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, said of the rush to fire higher education faculty.
Free speech consequences?
Kirk, who founded the campus conservative activism organization Turning Point USA and was close to Trump, was a hero to many Republicans. They saw a charismatic family man and a Christian unafraid to take his hard-right vision onto liberal college campuses.
But many Democrats and liberals experienced Kirk as a provocateur with a record of incendiary remarks about people of color, immigrants and Islam. While many of Kirk’s opponents have condemned the assassination, some have also emphasized their disagreement with his views or suggested his death arose out of what they saw as his hateful rhetoric.
“I have faculty who are getting fired, who have tenure and are getting fired, for saying things like ‘I condemn political violence but the words that Charlie Kirk used, he sort of reaped what he sowed,’” Wolfson said. “All things told, I may not agree with that statement, but that’s a perfectly reasonable thing for somebody to say. Certainly not something to be fired for.”

Some Republicans have long denounced what they view as past Democratic censorship, including Biden administration efforts to pressure social media companies to censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have also criticized firings and pushed back on perceived political correctness run amok during the height of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, moments of ascendant progressive influence.
But as the current round of terminations plays out, some conservatives argue public employees who speak out about Kirk are facing the consequences of their actions. Oklahoma state Rep. Gabe Woolley, a Republican, said individuals in a taxpayer-funded role who work with children should be held to a high level of accountability.
“I think the most important factor to consider … is that these people chose to enter the public square on public social media accounts and to mock and celebrate the death of an American patriot who was a Christian martyr who was killed for his faith doing what God called him to do,” Woolley said.
Woolley added that “if you choose to make something public, you should not be shocked or surprised by any type of public pushback.”
Swierc described a relatively restricted Facebook account. It was private and couldn’t be found by searching for her name; only individuals with mutual Facebook friends could request to add her as a friend. She did not list her employer on her profile.
Swierc’s post on Kirk could only be seen by her Facebook friends. At some point, someone — Swierc doesn’t know who — made a screenshot of the post. It was then circulated publicly and ended up on Indiana’s “Eyes on Education” page.
On Sept. 17, Ball State University President Geoffrey Mearns fired Swierc, who had been director of health promotion and advocacy within the Division of Student Affairs. In a letter informing Swierc of her termination, Mearns wrote that many current students had written to the university to express concern and that her post had caused unprecedented disruption.
Swierc filed a federal lawsuit against Mearns on Monday, alleging he violated her First Amendment rights. Swierc, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, wants a court to order Mearns to expunge her termination from her Ball State University personnel file, along with unspecified damages.
“I do not regret the post I made, and I would not take back what I said,” Swierc said during a virtual news conference organized by the ACLU of Indiana. “I believe that I, along with every person in this country, have First Amendment rights to be able to speak on a number of things.”
Ball State University declined to answer Stateline’s questions, citing the lawsuit. In an unsigned public statement on the day of Swierc’s firing, the university said the post was “inconsistent with the distinctive nature and trust” of Swierc’s leadership position and had caused significant disruption to the university.
Swierc’s lawsuit is one of a growing number of legal challenges to firings and employee discipline over comments about Kirk. On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the University of South Dakota to reinstate an art professor who had placed on administrative leave after calling Kirk a “Nazi” but later deleted the post and apologized.
Aggressive state attorney general
Swierc didn’t name Rokita, the attorney general, as a defendant in her lawsuit, but the official has loomed over the situation.
Two days after Kirk’s assassination, Rokita urged his followers on X to submit to him any evidence of educators or school administrators celebrating or rationalizing the killing. He wrote that they must be held accountable and “have no place teaching our students.”
But Rokita has also said the Indiana Attorney General’s Office isn’t investigating individuals submitted to his “Eyes on Education” page — suggesting the effort is mainly intended to generate public pressure against employers. Each example on the page lists contact information for the school’s leadership and in some instances information about the next local school board meeting.
“For a government official, especially of that caliber, to be creating a database and doing this has an incredibly chilling effect on speech,” said Ashkhen Kazaryan, a senior legal fellow at The Future of Free Speech, a nonpartisan think tank located at Vanderbilt University that promotes the values of free speech and free expression.
Rokita didn’t agree to an interview. “Our goal is to provide transparency, equipping parents with the information they need to make informed decisions about their children’s education,” Rokita said in a news release.
On Monday, Rokita sent a six-page letter to school superintendents and public university administrators, providing guidance on the legal authority to fire and discipline teachers for speech related to Kirk. The letter suggested that speech occurring on social media is a factor that weighs in favor of the authority to fire an employee because it carries the risk of being amplified and disrupting school operations.
Rokita also analyzed comments about Kirk by a U.S. history teacher in Indiana who had said the assassinated activist can “suck it” and referred to comments made by Kirk in 2023 that some gun deaths every year are the cost of Second Amendment rights. The district’s employer had chosen not to terminate the teacher, but Rokita laid out a legal justification for firing the employee.
He concluded the letter by writing that many schools would be within their legal authority to fire teachers “who have similarly contributed to the divisive and, for many, painful eruption of controversial discourse on social media and elsewhere concerning Charlie Kirk.”
Joseph Mastrosimone, an employment law professor at Washburn University, said private employers have broad discretion to fire workers over speech. But the government is different, he said, with the First Amendment providing at least some level of protection to employees.
Decades of court cases have established the core principle that if a public employee is speaking in their capacity as a citizen on a matter of public concern, then the government can only take action if the speech causes significant disruption to the delivery of the public service and that disruption outweighs the employee’s interest in the speech, he said.
Mastrosimone said if a teacher’s message made in his or her own time is causing community outrage and pandemonium, “that’s probably going to count as some disruption.”
“And there might be sufficient disruption to outweigh whatever interest the employee has in the speech,” Mastrosimone said. But the closer the teacher’s message is to core political speech — such as voicing support for a candidate for office — the more the scales tip in favor of the employee being able to speak without fear of discipline.
“It is certainly a matter of public concern, what’s going on here with the Charlie Kirk assassination. The interests are probably pretty high, I would think,” Mastrosimone said.
Push to honor Kirk
As some Republican officials have called for action against public employees who have made comments about Kirk, they have often drawn a line at what they see as celebrating or glorifying his assassination. Walters, the outgoing Oklahoma state superintendent, has gone further and is investigating districts for “refusing to honor his memory.”
In times of crisis, states have few tools to fight misinformation

The Oklahoma State Department of Education last week said in addition to reports on individual teachers, it was investigating 30 reports of schools that didn’t observe a moment of silence. Three reports alleged schools weren’t flying their flags at half-staff.
On Tuesday, Walters announced an official push to start a Turning Point USA chapter in every Oklahoma high school. Later that day, he announced he would resign as superintendent to become CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a new group that casts itself as a conservative alternative to teachers’ unions.
Walters’ Turning Point effort comes after Oklahoma state Sen. Shane Jett, a Republican, filed three pieces of legislation to honor Kirk, including one that would establish “Charlie Kirk Free Speech Day” and another requiring public colleges and universities to develop a “Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza” on their campuses.
Walters and Jett didn’t respond to interview requests.
“Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active,” Walters said in a news release on Tuesday. “We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)With no warning last Friday, a former Cincinnati Children’ s Hospital chaplain was released after a 72-day stay in the Butler County Jail. 
It appears that immigration officials concluded that they didn’t have a case for revoking Ayman Solimon’s status as a refugee. That’s what his lawyers and his many defenders had been saying all along.
“How they came to this conclusion, no one knows,” Soliman said in a phone interview Monday evening. “There was no case. It was an act of retaliation. It was an ungrounded, baseless case.” 
Even so, the attempt to deport the Egyptian asylee ignited a national uproar. It also sparked a protest march to which police reacted and arrested two journalists who tried to cover the march. 
Soliman fled Egypt in 2014 after being detained by the government four times and tortured on one of those occasions, he said.
As a tour guide under the regime of autocrat Hosni Mubarek, Soliman said he was arrested for his dissident political views.
Authorities applied electroshocks, beat him and put out cigarettes on his naked body, according to Soliman. They took him to an open courtyard in winter, stripped him to his underwear and doused him in cold water. They deprived him of food, water and sleep. They hung him by his arms, which were behind his back.
“This was all extrajudicial punishment,” Soliman said. 
Mubarek was deposed during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Soliman worked as a journalist during that time, as a freelance producer for international news organizations, and on a documentary.
Representing the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi was elected president in 2012. But the military seized power the following year. Soliman again found himself in the crosshairs of the authorities.
“After the military coup, I was abducted off the street as I was going to cover some protests opposing the coup against the elected president,” he said. “For three days they told me I was a criminal and I was a traitor working for a foreign agency. I was a journalist. I had my credentials. It was not a crime. But of course they accused every independent journalist of being a traitor working for a foreign power that was working to destabilize the great country of Egypt.”
Never having been the object of an official proceeding by the government, Soliman was able to go to Chicago in 2014 to study documentary filmmaking. He initially planned on returning to Egypt, thinking the military government would be short-lived. 
But after a government raid on his Egyptian home and seeing multiple journalists abducted and disappeared, Soliman decided to apply for asylum. It was granted in 2018.
That asylum was suddenly revoked on June 3 over alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the United States has not designated a terrorist group, though Trump and Republicans in Congress are pushing to do so.
“They claimed that I volunteered with a charitable organization in Egypt — it was one of the most trusted and reputable organizations in Egypt — and they said it might be linked to the Muslim Brotherhood,” Soliman said. “Even if it was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood — which is not true — it’s not listed as a terrorist organization in the U.S.” 
After the cancellation of a July 3 hearing in immigration court, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Soliman on July 9 and took him to Butler County Jail in Hamilton. The jail, along with a number of others in Ohio, has a contract to house people detained by ICE under President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation effort.
Soliman said he was treated poorly. But then, so was everyone.
“It’s a jail,” he said. “ICE detainees shouldn’t be there. We are not criminals. They applied the same rules to us as they applied to the other offenders. It’s just dehumanizing.”
But much more than that, he was scared what would happen if attempts to revoke his refugee status were successful and he was sent back to Egypt. 
“In some ways, it was as scary as what happened in Egypt because if I was deported, it could be torture and death,” he said. “So for me, it wasn’t just about being in jail, it was about the consequences. For me deportation could be death.”
As Soliman sat in jail, his legal team and others poked holes in the case to revoke his asylum. Two academics said their work was misrepresented  by federal authorities who tried to use it to support their claim that Soliman was connected to terrorists. His lawyers pointed to what they said were false, shifting reasons the government used to hold their client in jail.
Finally, the government appeared to capitulate on Friday when it released Soliman.
“The trial was coming up next week and I think it was going to be pretty ugly for the government,” said Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. “It was pretty gory what happened to him in Egypt. He was tortured. All those details were going to be repeated. The government didn’t really have a case. They didn’t have any specific accusations of bad activity that Ayman was involved in.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the specifics of Soliman’s case. But it said it had power over noncitizens even if they’re in the country legally.
“An alien – even with a pending application or lawful status – is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” an unnamed DHS official said in an email. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services “is responsible for administering America’s lawful immigration system, ensuring the integrity of the immigration process, and protecting the interests of the American people by screening and vetting aliens; but generally speaking, and as a matter of practice, USCIS cannot discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
Soliman is free, but he said he’s concerned about what happened to some supporters during his incarceration.
Two chaplains were fired from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital — one for attending a vigil for Soliman, and another for giving media interviews in support of her former colleague. After he fired the two, hospital CEO Steve Davis warned other employees to keep quiet about Soliman.
Soliman called on the hospital to rehire the chaplains.
“I think my friends did the right thing by advocating for their colleague, who was facing death back in Egypt,” he said. “I know those who made this decision (to fire them) got a lot of pushback. And I think (the chaplains) should be back in their jobs.”
On July 17, as about 100 people left a vigil for Soliman and marched over the John A. Roebling Bridge into Kentucky, the Covington, Ky., Police Department made 15 arrests, including journalists, shortly after giving an order to disperse. 
Cincinnati CityBeat reporter Madeline Fening and photo intern Lucas Griffith were arrested as they covered the march, which occupied travel lanes, obstructing traffic. 
Fening and Griffith were charged with felony rioting. 
Covington authorities later dropped the felony charges against the journalists, and Fening is scheduled for trial on misdemeanors next week. Griffith is scheduled for Oct. 2. 
Meanwhile, more than 20 journalism organizations last week wrote to Kenton County Attorney Stacy Tapke, stressing the importance of a free press and asking her to drop the charges against the reporters, WCPO TV reported Tuesday.
Soliman said he watched TV coverage of the march and the way Covington police reacted from jail. He said he couldn’t sleep that night — partly because of the violence in which some officers engaged. But Soliman was also disturbed that police in the United States would be so quick to arrest reporters covering their beats.
“A free press is essential in any civilized country,” he said. “A free press is a guarantee that people’s voices will always be heard. It is not a crime, and journalists should be protected as long as they’re doing their work professionally. Brutalizing and arresting journalists means these people are doing something wrong, and they don’t want the journalists to cover it.”
Soliman added, “I’m not surprised this is happening with this current government. Civil rights. Free speech. The First Amendment. They are all under direct threat from this government.”

Bob Lynn (right) addresses a subcommittee of the House Education Funding Committee about a bill to expand due process rights for students and faculty on college campuses, on Sept. 23, 2025 (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)When a University of New Hampshire student reports to the school that they have been sexually assaulted by another student, a lengthy process begins.
Depending on how the alleged perpetrator responds to the accusation, that process can either be handled voluntarily, via a mediation process, or it can play out in a hearing with both sides attempting to prove their case. The possibilities are spelled out in the university’s 31-page policy prohibiting sexual misconduct. 
The process can be complex. The victim and the alleged offender are each allowed to be represented by an attorney. The hearings can feel like court trials, with opening and closing statements made by lawyers or representatives before a decision maker. 
But however the process plays out, the UNH policy makes one point clear: “Neither party may directly question the other party or witness.” This fall, some House lawmakers are proposing to change that.
A bill gaining momentum would overhaul how UNH and other public colleges and universities conduct disciplinary proceedings. And one proposed change would require the institutions to allow alleged perpetrators to question their accusers directly. 
In New Hampshire, the bill could kick off the latest round of a long-running national debate.
Sponsored by Rep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican and a former state Supreme Court chief justice, House Bill 510 would mandate that those institutions put in place a standardized list of due process guarantees in those disciplinary proceedings. Among the rights universities would need to extend to the accused are “the right of the presumption that no violation occurred,” “the right against self-incrimination,” and “the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who provide evidence against” the defendant.
The bill would apply to university disciplinary proceedings against students, student organizations, and faculty members. The proposed statutory requirements could thus apply to a number of proceedings, from academic dishonesty to breaches of the code of conduct. 
But the bill’s implications for sexual misconduct proceedings has drawn specific criticism from Democrats in Concord, who have argued the new process could re-traumatize victims and discourage them from reporting sexual assaults. 
Republicans, like Lynn, have countered that the right to confront one’s accuser is essential to a fair hearing, and have pointed to the consequences such proceedings can have for those accused. 
On Tuesday, in an exchange during a House Education Funding Committee work session on the bill, Democratic Rep. Hope Damon, of Croydon, raised concerns about how the bill could affect survivors of sexual assault.
“I think it is risking grave harm to victims of sexual assault to be cross examined by their assaulter,” she said.
“I fundamentally disagree with that,” Lynn responded. “The idea that somebody can be charged with … something that could affect the person for the rest of their lives that they do not have the right to confront their accuser.”
The University System of New Hampshire and the Community College System of New Hampshire have both raised objections to the bill, arguing it will require costly and unnecessary changes to their policies.
“We feel that due process is already well represented within all of our policies,” said Shannon Reid, executive director of government affairs at CCSNH, speaking to lawmakers. 
The bill, she said, “includes specificity such that it would necessitate a significant level of work to basically redraw how we do things without … substantively strengthening due process.”
A federal back-and-forth on campus due process
The New Hampshire bill comes after a series of dramatic swings in federal policy around campus sexual assault proceedings in recent years.
Colleges and universities are required to follow Title IX, a federal law established in 1972 that outlaws sex-based discrimination on campus. 
In a pair of guidelines in 2011 and 2014, the Department of Education under President Barack Obama interpreted Title IX to require higher education institutions to address sexual assault on campus. Among its recommendations, the department said it “strongly discourages schools from allowing the parties personally to question or cross-examine each other during the hearing.”
But in President Donald Trump’s first term, the Department of Education reversed course, repealing many of the Obama-era sexual assault recommendations and advising colleges to allow alleged offenders to cross-examine alleged victims using an advisor.
Unlike the proposed New Hampshire law, the Trump administration policy, which took effect in 2020, did not require institutions to allow defendants to question their accusers directly. The policy remains in place today; an effort by President Joe Biden to change the guidelines again was struck down by a federal judge in Kentucky in January.
To public institutions, the changing guidance has felt like a “pendulum,” said Chad Pimentel, general counsel of the University System of New Hampshire. The latest version of the UNH anti-sexual assault guidance, for instance, was crafted with the Trump administration’s 2020 guidance in mind.
So far, there does not appear to be interest in the second Trump administration to make any more changes, Pimentel said in an interview. But HB 510 would require that the university drop its prohibition on parties directly questioning each other.
Pimentel argued there already exists due process protections that allow someone accused to challenge their accuser’s narrative. Typically, at hearings, this is done by submitting a list of questions that they would like the neutral fact-finder to ask the other person.
“There’s ways to confront (the other party) without you having to sit across — this far away — from somebody you’re accusing and that person gets to ask you questions,” he said. 
Lynn has argued that to be most robust, the right to confront an accuser must be given to the accused, not just to their lawyer or representative or to a fact-finder. 
But, he added, “that doesn’t mean that anything goes, that the person that’s accused can berate, harass, yell at (the accuser), whatever. Of course, they can’t do that.”
Growing Republican support
While Democrats have objected, Lynn’s bill appears to have Republican support. 
HB 510 was introduced in January but was held by the committee over the summer for further work. The full committee is slated to vote on a recommendation for the bill next week and the House will take up that recommendation in early January. 
On Tuesday, Republican Chairman Rick Ladd of Haverhill suggested he could support the bill with some revisions. Ladd’s main concern was that the definitions in the bill for “student,” “student organization,” and “public institution of higher education” are different from those in other parts of the higher education statutes. Lynn said he would be open to amending the bill to align those definitions.
If the bill passes the House in January, it will also need to pass the Senate. In 2024, a similar bill brought by Lynn, House Bill 1288, failed to clear that hurdle. 
Back then, senators in both parties expressed worries that HB 1288 could force the institutions to violate collective bargaining agreements with university staff unions, which typically lay out agreed-upon disciplinary procedures. The Senate voted unanimously to send the bill to further study.
This year’s bill is meant to address that problem, Lynn said Tuesday. HB 510 stipulates that the new disciplinary process will not affect faculty member disciplinary procedures until their current collective bargaining agreement runs out. After that, new collective bargaining agreements would need to align with the new law, Lynn said.
To Lynn and other Republicans, the aims of the bill are clear: to bring university procedures in line with those already employed by courts. And if universities already have the bill’s protections in their policies, they won’t need to change anything, he said.
“I think, as a state, we should give everybody equal protection and make sure that certain standards are applicable to every campus, and this, to me, sets the minimum amount of protection that everybody should have when they attend the higher education institution,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican. 
Opponents say that determination should be made by the institution. 
“There’s no indication that the rights of students aren’t being met, or parents, within the law,” said Rep. Wayne Burton, a Durham Democrat. “I don’t think the state needs to chime in from this level.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bob-Lynn-House-Education-Funding-Committee-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 05:56:21.398780

Brian Kemp announces changes to Georgia Pathways during the first week of the 2025 legislative session. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia has received approval from the Trump administration to extend its Pathways to Coverage program, a partial Medicaid expansion with work requirement components, at least through the end of 2026.
An approval letter from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that was sent this week to Georgia leaders noted that the temporary extension and its amendments are designed to help the program accomplish its goals. 
The federal agency approved changes that were announced early this year, such as exempting caregivers of young children from the program’s work requirement. 
Currently, participants must complete 80 hours of work, job training, education or community service every month – and report that activity to the state. Under the new program rules, those qualifying activities would need to be reported annually instead of monthly as previously required. 
CMS noted that these changes are meant to “increase the number of potentially eligible beneficiaries under the demonstration who qualify for and maintain coverage.”

Gov. Brian Kemp touted the approval as a collaboration with the Trump administration while criticizing former President Joe Biden administration’s efforts to prevent states from establishing work requirements in order to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
“Unlike the previous administration which chose to sue, obstruct, and delay, President Trump and his team have worked alongside us to improve Georgia Pathways and ultimately deliver a better program to Georgians who need it most. We look forward to continuing that partnership in the months ahead,” Kemp said in a statement Thursday.

The program was extended shortly after the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report highlighting concerns about the program’s effectiveness and cost. The report was ordered by Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff, along with other lawmakers. The report found that the program came in “over budget and under delivered,” enrolling only 3,500 individuals in its first year, far short of the state’s projected goal of 25,028.
The GAO report found that the administrative spending for the program was substantial. Out of the $80.3 million spent on the program from fiscal year 2021 through the second quarter of 2025, approximately $54.2 million was allocated to administrative costs, with $26.1 million spent on health care benefits for recipients.
CMS’s approval letter acknowledged the low enrollment, noting that as of May 2025, enrollment was approximately 7,463 individuals, and attributes the shortfall to a “general lack of awareness and understanding of the program; a complex and administratively burdensome application process; and a limited set of exemptions and qualifying activities.”
The new GAO report also noted that CMS “wrongly approved higher federal matching rates for certain administrative costs, wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Reaction to the program’s extension was mixed
The extension and its policy changes have been met with a mix of praise and criticism.
Natalie Crawford, executive director of Georgia First, a nonprofit think tank and policy advocacy group, said the changes are positive steps but called for a more comprehensive approach.
“More covered lives are always good but we know Georgia can do better,” said Crawford, a former Republican commissioner in Habersham County. Crawford criticized the program as “fiscally irresponsible.” 
In an interview Thursday, Crawford pointed to challenges Georgia will face in 2026 with the state managing two distinct work requirement policies: a less-frequent reporting schedule for the Pathways to Coverage population, while establishing the more frequent reporting requirements under the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that will be implemented in 2027. That could increase administrative costs for the state, and it’s unclear whether the Pathways to Coverage population will be exempt from less frequent reporting requirements once work requirements under the new federal law are implemented.
“I think there’s still a lot of unknowns,” Crawford said.
The Georgia Hospital Association praised the extension, saying that it “will further strengthen the program and improve coverage and access to health care for Georgians.”
“This continuation further preserves access for the thousands of Georgians that are already benefiting and improves access for additional Georgians that will now find it more streamlined to qualify. We appreciate the Governor, the team at DCH, and CMS for continuing to champion and advance this program,” said Caylee Noggle, president and CEO of the Georgia Hospital Association.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that changing to annual reporting is an improvement for the program, but work requirements are still likely to be an impediment to coverage. She said that while the monthly reporting was burdensome for recipients, it did not account for Georgia’s low program enrollment because the state did not disenroll individuals who did not submit monthly reports to verify their qualifying hours and activities.
“Moving to annual reporting is a critical program pivot and will reduce the administrative burden on enrollees. However, it does not change the fundamental issues that are suppressing enrollment among potentially eligible Georgians and creating unnecessary costs for Georgia’s taxpayers: an outdated, confusing enrollment system; disinvestment in customer service and frontline caseworkers; and unnecessary bureaucratic red tape for low-income, uninsured Georgians that largely are already working, going to school, or caregiving,” Chan said in a statement.

During a recent Health Connect South conference in Atlanta, CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz addressed the Georgia program and defended the concept of work requirements in health coverage. He spoke about the national approach to Medicaid and the changes brought by recent federal legislation.
“I know a lot about the Georgia program. It’s actually known widely around the country, because it’s, I think, a very smart path for states who are not expanding Medicaid, and it might be a path for states that have expanded who want to go back. And it’s a clever and thoughtful and customized approach,” Oz said.
He went on to describe the philosophy behind the requirements, saying that without work requirements, Americans covered by Medicaid may be incentivized not to seek employment.
“The people don’t want to just stay at home. They actually do want to go work, but because of this bizarre compensation and almost bribe for you to stay home by giving you free health insurance, you incentivize people not to enter the workforce,” Oz said.
Crawford pushed back on that notion, saying that she has not seen any “compelling evidence” suggesting that people who would benefit from Medicaid expansion are incentivized to stay home when that coverage does not include a work reporting requirement.
“I think, honestly, when, for that specific population, more red tape is introduced, it can incentivize quite the opposite. These are folks who want to work. They want to work. They’re going to work. They’re trying to pay their bills and do what we so often say, ‘pull themselves up by their bootstraps,’” Crawford said.
Warnock, however, cast Georgia’s program as an example of bad policy.
“The only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,” Warnock said in a statement Thursday. “If Republican politicians were serious about getting people to work, they would have closed the coverage gap nationwide and cut out the government bureaucracy. (Renewing the program) will continue to keep health care away from Georgians who need it most. It is wrong, it is immoral, and it only makes our country sicker and poorer.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC0231-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 05:56:21.398780

Cleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio’s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.


The plant emits roughly 4.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year, complicating Cleveland’s effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report released by advocacy group Industrious Labs this summer. The plant is the city’s largest single source of planet-warming pollution.


Cleveland’s climate action plan is ​“bold and achievable,” said Hilary Lewis, steel director for Industrious Labs. But ​“if they want to achieve those goals, they have to take action on this Cleveland Works facility.”


As a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it’s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions — or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.

Cliffs’ progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a 2023 Goal Achiever in the Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 infrastructure law.


Then the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of ​“green” hydrogen made with renewable energy. In June, Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves backed away from a federally funded project to convert its Middletown Works in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn’t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.


To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. “[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,” she said.

Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs’ modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 39 early deaths per year, more than 1,700 lost work days, and more than 9,000 asthma cases. Cleveland ranks as the country’s fifth-worst city for people with asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.


 A road map for cutting carbon



Cleveland Works’ Blast Furnace #6 is a hulking vessel that removes impurities from iron ore by combining it with limestone and coke, a form of coal that burns at very high temperatures. Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life.


To Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% if natural gas is used. Using green hydrogen would slash emissions even more, the Industrious Labs team found.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility’s Blast Furnace #5 in 2022.
Relining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.

Cliffs did not respond to Canary Media’s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6.


To put itself on track with Cleveland’s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6 to the direct reduction process, Industrious Labs said.


The next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace — which can run on carbon-free power — instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #6, would increase emissions cuts to 47%, according to the Industrious Labs report.


Later steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #5. Completing that work would cut Cleveland Works’ greenhouse gas emissions by 96%, according to the report.

 What happens now?

The Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County’s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is in the process of finalizing the latest version of its climate action plan.


“My question about the paper is how feasible it truly is that Cleveland-Cliffs will deploy it in the near future,” McGowan said. Policy uncertainties at the federal level further complicate matters, she added.


For now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.


But getting to net-zero for the industrial sector ​“will require more fundamental changes … [which] will take place over decades, rather than over a few years,” Cleveland’s climate action plan says. It also notes that low-carbon steel costs 40% more to produce compared to standard methods, ​“making it difficult for steelmakers to justify the investment in clean production.”


Cuyahoga County’s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs’ energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works’ use of some iron from the firm’s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50 megawatts, the plan notes. That replaces electricity the plant would otherwise need from the grid, a majority of which still comes from fossil fuels.


Faster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize — especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city’s port.


In Lewis’ view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. ​“I think the biggest thing is staying competitive,” Lewis said.
One of Cliffs’ largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6 billion in a new plant in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, that will produce low-carbon steel. As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.


The Industrious Labs report ​“opens the door for Cleveland to be a leader in clean steel,” Lewis said. Before that can happen, though, ​“there’s a lot of work to do.”

Susan Collins, to push for a stopgap measure that includes an extension of health insurance subsidies.  In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that she supports exte[...]","Interfaith leaders held a vigil outside U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ Portland office on Sept. 25, 2025 urging her to push for health care subsidies in a must-pass government funding bill. (Photo courtesy of Maine People's Alliance)As the end of the fiscal year approaches, pressure is building on Maine’s congressional delegation, specifically Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, to push for a stopgap measure that includes an extension of health insurance subsidies. 
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that she supports extending the credit but believes they should be addressed outside the must-pass spending bill. She noted that, unlike funding the government, the subsidies don’t have a Sept. 30 deadline. They expire at the end of the calendar year. 
Democrats are trying to use the leverage of a looming government shutdown to push for an extension of these subsidies and other priorities they otherwise would likely not be able to enact under GOP control. It’s become a familiar approach for Congress, though the party roles have been reversed.  
Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs.
Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown

“It is clear that we need to act on this issue, but our focus right now needs to be on avoiding a harmful government shutdown that would cause disruptions to vital programs that many Americans rely on every day,” Collins said in a statement. “Our constituents should not be used as pawns amid a needlessly partisan impasse.”
The White House sent guidance to departments and agencies, telling them that if a shutdown begins Wednesday, they’re expected to institute mass firings and layoffs.
Collins added that passing a continuing resolution would afford Congress the time to complete its annual funding bills and take up legislation to extend the subsidies this fall. 
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with Democratic congressional leaders to discuss the minority party’s asks, which in addition to extending the subsidies include reversing the Medicaid cuts made in the GOP spending bill in July. 
With the president unwilling to negotiate with Democrats on funding now, some worry that leaves little assurance that the subsidies will be extended later, as Collins suggests. 
In September, the Maine Bureau of Insurance announced the finalized 2026 health insurance rates, with an average increase of 23.9% for the individual market and 17.5% for the small employer market.
Thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the subsidies are not extended. 
Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance Robert Carey attributed the increased costs to the instability of federal policies, including the expiring credits and the impacts of Trump’s tariffs. Other factors include the growing costs of medical services and prescription drugs.
Several groups held events in Maine on Thursday specifically calling on Collins to extend the subsidies and highlighting what’s at stake for Mainers. 
During a virtual event hosted by the Maine chapter of Protect Our Care, a progressive healthcare advocacy organization, Briana Bononcini, co-owner of the Portland Hunt + Alpine Club cocktail bar said she has been enrolled in a health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act since 2014. Not having insurance tied to an employer allowed her to start her small business while ensuring she and her children were still covered. 
“It’s been disappointing to see Susan Collins say that she supports restoring the premium tax credit, but the reality is that she could have stopped this from occurring and she chose not to,” Bononcini said. “I really think that if she truly cares, like she says she does, she will show up and make sure that the premium tax credits are in the bill.”
State Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) spoke at that event about broader implications of losing the credit, which he described as an existential threat to the entire health care system in the state.
Pointing to strides the state Legislature has made to expand health care coverage, such as creating a state-based insurance marketplace and reducing medical debt, Tipping said “these federal changes undo all of that work.” 
“Fewer Mainers will have health coverage, and when they’re sick, they’re going to go to the emergency room, which is the most expensive form of health care,” he said. “Mainers will pay for this in the form of increased premiums in their private insurance, and it’s going to hit Maine small business owners first and hardest.”
Additionally, faith leaders organized under Maine’s largest community organization, Maine People’s Alliance, held a vigil outside Collins’ Portland office on Thursday urging her to do what they see as the moral thing. 
“Accountability is a core part of my Unitarian Universalist faith,” said Rev. Tara Humphries of Allen Avenue Unitarian Universalist Church in Portland. “We are individuals, part of something much larger and more deeply connected than our own selves, and justice calls us to consider that when making decisions that impact the whole. So, I hold my elected officials accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of their most vulnerable constituents.”
Many of the speakers also called on Collins to stop funding to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in light of continued accusations of unlawful activity. 
“As people of faith, we believe the health and well-being of all our neighbors matter,” said Rev. Alison Patton of First Congregational Church of South Portland. “So we are calling on Senator Collins to step up and demand the budget changes we need, to ensure legal protections for immigrant Mainers, resist illegal ICE activity and preserve access to healthcare for all Mainers.”

It might make sense. Yet back in 2021, Masterson’s fellow state Sen. Gene Suellentrop was arrested on DUI charges. According to officials, he was driving the wrong way on Interstate 70 in Topeka at speeds near 100 mph. He then challenged police after they pulled him over, calling an officer “donut boy.”
By any measure, Suellentrop posed a threat to public health and welfare. He wasn’t posting online. He put his fellow motorists at deadly risk. Yet in that case, Masterson issued the plea for tolerance I reproduced at the very beginning of this column. Those words carried weight, and Suellentrop served in the Kansas Senate through January 2023.
Does Masterson believe that others deserve such grace?
As for the First Amendment, that’s a matter of law. The U.S. Constitution protects a variety of expression that broad majorities of people find tasteless, vulgar and unforgivable.
That doesn’t protect those expressing such sentiments from social opprobrium or employment consequences, especially if they work for private businesses. Those on the left made such arguments fairly recently, as movement for social justice crested in 2020 and misinformation about COVID-19 flourished. Those on the right are making such arguments now, and while they might be hypocritical, they’re not wrong. The right to speak your mind doesn’t mean the right to say it without feedback.
Problems arise, however, when the government itself tries to enforce such consequences, or when those working for the government speak in their private capacity. That’s why Masterson’s second quote at the beginning of this column struck me.
Let’s read it again: “When government tries to interfere with the right to speak, worship, assemble, or report what government is doing, the result is never good.”
Masterson still serves as Senate president. He’s running to be the state’s chief executive. Is he not a representative of government? Is he not attempting to interfere with others’ right to speak? One of those targeted by his recent posts just filed a lawsuit against the Kansas State Department of Education, claiming interference in her rights as a private citizen.
As for Colyer, the former governor appears to reside on a completely different planet.
Give him points for consistency: Back in 2018, he complained about an art exhibit at the University of Kansas that included a defaced American flag. (Expression also protected by the First Amendment, in case you wondered.) His social media channels have competed with Masterson’s for hardcore conservative attention, but I had to highlight this particular post.

Once again, the University of Kansas is proving that common decency is optional on its campus. A KU employee publicly cheered the brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, calling him ‘better in the ground as worm food,’ and reports now say there will be no disciplinary action.… pic.twitter.com/kw6vAKSlD4

Quoth the former governor: “Kansas values free speech, but glorifying murder is not free speech. It is a moral collapse!”
I don’t disagree with the moral collapse part. We can all do better. But the First Amendment safeguards pretty heinous stuff, including the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest at military funerals. The agreeableness of expression has nothing to do with whether the Constitution protects it. As someone running for the highest office in Kansas, Colyer should know better.
I reached out to the Masterson and Colyer campaigns to give them a chance to respond. Neither one got back to me by publication time.
 
A few extra words
Hello, friends.
It’s been quite the month. On Sept. 14, I ran the classic William Allen White editorial “To an Anxious Friend,” which sums up my feelings during this turbocharged political moment.
But I feel like I owe you a bit of an explanation for why I’ve approached opinion columns the way I have since Kirk’s death. I have not raced to run pieces on the topic, by myself or others. In troubled times, I believe that those of us in the opinion business can choose to calm the waters or agitate them.
I chose to focus on calm.
Not because I’m not concerned. Not because I haven’t tracked the waves of antipathy from the right and left. But because when someone’s brutal slaying becomes part of our national partisan conflict, I feel profoundly queasy. It should go without saying that political violence and violent threats have no place in these United States. Full stop. It should also go without saying that the First Amendment remains the law of the land and applies to every one of us lucky enough to live here.
Unfortunately, some folks still miss that free speech part, which is why I wrote the main part of today’s column.
I do not plan to change my approach to opinion, focusing on how Statehouse policy affects everyday folks. The point of this section has always been to lift up Kansas voices on Kansas topics. You can find abundant commentary on topics of national interest everywhere. You can’t find an array of local commentators like ours anywhere else. I take this job seriously, and I treasure the role of curating community conversations.
Thank you for reading. Let’s all keep talking.

The findings, published by researchers at Ohio State University and Johns Hopkins University, followed up participants from a study published in 2021 to track whether the dramatic improvements in depression symptoms would endure. The results suggest they do – and, remarkably, without serious side-effects.
The original study involved 24 people aged 21 to 75 who were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin treatment in 2019 and 2020 either immediately or after an eight-week delay. Each participant received two doses of the psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms, spaced two weeks apart, alongside 13 hours of psychotherapy support.
When researchers checked in five years later, the improvements in depression seen after one year were still holding strong, suggesting psilocybin therapy may last longer than traditional treatments, such as antidepressants or psychotherapy.
But the researchers are cautious about overselling their findings. The follow-up study lacked a comparison group, making it impossible to know whether people who recovered from depression through other means might experience similar long-term success. Eleven of the 18 participants who remained in the trial also reported using antidepressants during the study period, muddying the waters about what exactly drove their continued recovery.
The study design presents other puzzles as well. Was it the psilocybin itself that proved beneficial, or the extensive psychotherapy, or some combination of both? The original research didn’t include a placebo group – everyone knew they were taking psilocybin – raising questions about whether expectations alone might have influenced the outcomes.
Despite these limitations, other studies are painting a similar picture of psilocybin’s enduring effects on depression. While psychedelic research is still in its infancy and grapples with design challenges, the results consistently show significant reductions in depression symptoms following psychedelic-assisted therapy.
What makes these findings particularly intriguing is the suggestion that just one or two treatment sessions might deliver lasting benefits. This is in stark contrast to traditional antidepressants, which typically require daily use and often come with a catalogue of side-effects.
The researchers propose that psilocybin therapy may trigger “positive behavioural feedback loops”, helping people gain fresh perspectives and emotional insights that continue benefiting their lives long after the treatment ends. This could enable the development of healthier habits and relationships that serve as natural buffers against depression’s return.
One participant captured this transformation vividly: “I’m doing more of activities that I enjoy. My life these days is a lot more social with family. Helping out my family. Helping out friends. Connecting with old friends.”
 Psychology matters

At Lund University in Sweden, my colleagues and I are exploring similar territory, including an upcoming study on psilocybin and anorexia. And our early results, published in Scientific Reports, suggest that individual psychology plays a crucial role in both how people experience psychedelic sessions and the benefits they derive from them.
The picture becomes even more complex when considering that many people report personality changes after psychedelic experiences, particularly becoming more open to new experiences. This psychological shift adds another layer to understanding how and why psychedelics might produce lasting change.
Psychedelic research still faces significant hurdles, from creating convincing placebo groups to accounting for the self-selecting nature of many participants. These methodological challenges make it difficult to draw sweeping conclusions about psychedelics’ therapeutic potential.
Yet perhaps the most compelling evidence lies not in clinical scores but in participants’ own words about their transformed lives. As one person put it: “I think I’m more open to gratitude and more open to delight.” Such testimonies remind researchers why they’re exploring what some describe as potentially “one of the most meaningful experiences in life” – and why this emerging field of medicine deserves serious scientific attention.

(Getty Images)There has been a lot of talk lately about how best to connect some rural parts of our country to broadband. Broadband internet service is as vital to Nebraska’s well-being as any other critical infrastructure.
People considering a move want to know if their potential new home has reliable broadband, and people living without reliable service risk falling further behind as work, education and civic engagement increasingly move online.
Many like to focus on the upfront costs associated with connecting those areas of our state that have been left behind, and that is one crucial piece of information to determine how to get these areas connected. But there’s more to the story than just initial network construction costs.
It takes years of planning to design, build and pay for a network. It takes a business case often lacking in rural areas where distances are great and densities are low. And it’s not “mission accomplished” once a network is built.
Instead, building a network is one important step in the ongoing effort to deliver reliable and affordable connectivity. In other words, the mission of achieving “universal service” — ensuring that every American has both access to and can make use of broadband — takes work every day to achieve and sustain.
This is why we have the federal Universal Service Fund, or USF, an important and often overlooked program for rural internet access that you’ve likely never heard of. So, what is the USF? The Communications Act of 1934 included language that said that all Americans should have access to “rapid, efficient, nationwide communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.”
Almost 100 years later, the USF is the main federal program helping millions of rural consumers connect to services comparable to those in urban areas. It supports critical connections for schools, libraries and healthcare facilities in rural communities.
But even as the USF programs continue to be highly effective and enjoy widespread support, updates are needed to help sustain universal service for the decades to come. For example, the USF is currently paid for by contributions from service providers based on certain telecommunications services and revenues.
As fewer customers buy legacy telecom services, the burden on these companies and their customers increases, and entities whose services result in the greatest use of rural networks get a free ride while selling their own products. Netflix, for example, used to pay postage to get its content to its customers. Now ISPs essentially cover much of those delivery costs for them. This is unsustainable and unfair.
We need Congress to update the ways the USF is funded so that all who use and benefit from affordable and ubiquitous voice and broadband services contribute equitably to its mission. At the same time, transparency and accountability are critical when distributing billions of USF dollars.
Careful review and vetting of those seeking support is essential, and Nebraska broadband officials should continue to play an important complementary role in ensuring providers that receive USF funding are capable and have the capacity to serve the consumers and communities they are charged to help.
Congressional reforms should consider the contributions from members of a USF working group and rural broadband supporters, including U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb. Rural Americans need those reforms to update and sustain USF funding and help us achieve broadband connections built to last.
